However, the computational principles mediating the interaction between homeostatic and associative learning processes remain undefined. Here we use a definition of primary rewards, as outcomes fulfilling physiological needs, to build a normative theory showing how learning motivated behaviors may be modulated by internal states. Within this framework, we mathematically prove that seeking rewards is equivalent to the fundamental objective of physiological stability, defining the notion of physiological rationality of behavior. We further suggest a formal basis for temporal discounting of rewards by showing that discounting motivates animals to follow the shortest path in the space of physiological variables toward the desired setpoint. We also explain how animals learn to act predictively to preclude prospective homeostatic challenges, and several other behavioral patterns. Finally, we suggest a computational role for interaction between hypothalamus and the brain reward system."

However, the computational principles mediating the interaction between homeostatic and associative learning processes remain undefined. Here we use a definition of primary rewards, as outcomes fulfilling physiological needs, to build a normative theory showing how learning motivated behaviors may be modulated by internal states. Within this framework, we mathematically prove that seeking rewards is equivalent to the fundamental objective of physiological stability, defining the notion of physiological rationality of behavior. We further suggest a formal basis for temporal discounting of rewards by showing that discounting motivates animals to follow the shortest path in the space of physiological variables toward the desired setpoint. We also explain how animals learn to act predictively to preclude prospective homeostatic challenges, and several other behavioral patterns. Finally, we suggest a computational role for interaction between hypothalamus and the brain reward system."

There are two assumptions at the heart of the model. First, it is assumed that animals are capable of guessing the impact of the outcome of their behaviors on their internal state. Second, it is assumed that animals find a behavior rewarding if they believe that the predicted impact of its outcome will reduce the difference between a particular internal state and its ideal value. For example, a form of behavior for a human might be going to the kitchen, and an outcome might be eating chocolate."

Their theory also explains the physiological importance of a type of behavior known as \u2018delay discounting\u2019. Animals displaying this form of behavior regard a positive outcome as less rewarding the longer they have to wait for it.

Such, efficient behavioral decisions surely should depend on two brain circuits working in concert: the hypothalamic homeostatic regulation (HR) system, and the cortico-basal ganglia reinforcement learning (RL) mechanism. However, the computational mechanisms underlying this obvious coupling remain poorly understood."

On the basis of the proposed computational integration of the two systems, we prove analytically that reward-seeking and physiological stability are two sides of the same coin, and also provide a normative explanation for temporal discounting of reward. Behaviorally, the theory gives a plausible unified account for anticipatory responding and the rise-fall pattern of the response rate. We show that the interaction between the two systems is critical in these behavioral phenomena and thus, neither classical RL nor classical HR theories can account for them. Neurobiologically, we show that our model can shed light on recent findings on the interaction between the hypothalamus and the reward-learning circuitry, namely, the modulation of dopaminergic activity by hypothalamic signals. Furthermore, we show how orosensory information can be integrated with internal signals in a principled way, resulting in accounting for experimental results on consummatory behaviors, as well as the pathological condition of over-eating induced by hyperpalatability. Finally, we discuss limitations of the theory, compare it with other theoretical accounts of motivation and internal state regulation, and outline testable predictions and future directions."

In other words, biological systems actively resist the natural tendency to disorder by regulating their physiological state to fall within narrow bounds. This general process, known as homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cannon, 1929</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bernard, 1957</a>), includes adaptive behavioral strategies for counteracting and preventing self-entropy in the face of constantly changing environments. In this sense, one would expect organisms to reinforce responses that mitigate deviation of the internal state from desired \u2018setpoints\u2019. This is reminiscent of the drive-reduction theory (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hull, 1943</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Spence, 1956</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mowrer, 1960</a>) according to which, one of the major mechanisms underlying reward is the usefulness of the corresponding outcome in fulfilling the homeostatic needs of the organism (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cabanac, 1971</a>). Inspired by these considerations (i.e. preservation of self-order and reduction of deviations), we propose a formal definition of primary reward (equivalently: reinforcer, economic utility) as the approximated ability of an outcome to restore the internal equilibrium of the physiological state. We then demonstrate that our formal homeostatic reinforcement learning framework accounts for some phenomena that classical drive-reduction was unable to explain."

Our theory indicates that reward seeking without discounting (i.e., if <i>\u03b3</i> = 1) would not lead, and may even be detrimental, to physiological stability (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Intuitively, this is because a future-discounting agent would always tend to expedite bigger rewards and postpone punishments. Such an agent, therefore, tries to reduce homeostatic deviations (which is rewarding) as soon as possible, and thus, tries to find the shortest path toward the setpoint. A non-discounting agent, in contrast, can always compensate for a deviation-induced punishment by reducing that deviation any time in the future."

Imagine you had to plan a 1-hr hill walk from a drop-point toward a pickup point, during which you wanted to minimize the height (equivalent to drive) summed over the path you take. In this summation, if you give higher weights to your height in the near future as compared to later times, the optimum path would be to descend the hill and spend as long as possible at the bottom (i.e. homeostatic setpoint) before returning to the pickup point. <a href=\"#equ5\">Equation 5</a> shows that this optimization is equivalent to optimizing the total discounted rewards along the path, given that descending and ascending steps are defined as being rewarding and punishing, respectively (<a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>)."

In other words, in the absence of discounting, the rewarding value of a behavioral policy that changes the internal state only depends on the initial and final internal states, regardless of its trajectory in the homeostatic space. Thus, when <i>\u03b3</i> = 1, the values of any two behavioral policies with equal net shifts of the internal state are equal, even if one policy moves the internal state along the shortest path, whereas the other policy results in large deviations of the internal state from the setpoint and threatens survival. These results hold for any form of temporal discounting (e.g., exponential, hyperbolic). In this respect, our theory provides a normative explanation for the necessity of temporal discounting of reward: to maintain internal stability, it is necessary to discount future rewards."

Interestingly, in the first extinction trial on the ninth day where the ethanol was omitted, the animal's temperature exhibited a significant increase above normal after cue presentation. This indicates that the enhanced tolerance response to ethanol is triggered by the cue, and results in an increase of temperature in order to compensate for the forthcoming ethanol-induced hypothermia. Thus, this tolerance response is mediated by associative learning processes, and is aimed at regulating temperature. Here we demonstrate that the integration of HR and RL processes accounts for this phenomenon."

If the stimulus was not followed by ethanol injection, as in the first day of extinction (E1), the activation of the conditioned tolerance response resulted in an increase in body temperature.

In the simplest case, let us assume that the model is tabula rasa: it starts from absolute ignorance about the value of state\u2013action pairs, and can freely change its internal state in the homeostatic space. In a one-dimensional space, it means that the agent can freely increase or decrease the internal state (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As the value of \u2018increase\u2019 and \u2018decrease\u2019 actions at all internal states are initialized to zero, the agent starts by performing a random walk in the homeostatic space. However, the probability of choosing the same action for <math id=\"inf27\"><mi>z</mi></math> times in a row decreases exponentially as <i>z</i> increases (<math id=\"inf28\"><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>z</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><mrow><mo>\u2212</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></msup></mrow></math>): for example, the probability of choosing \u2018increase\u2019 is 2<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.5, the probability of choosing two successive \u2018increases\u2019 is 2<sup>\u22121</sup> = 0.25, the probability of choosing three successive \u2018increases\u2019 is 2<sup>\u22123</sup> = 0.125, and so on. Thus, it is highly likely for the agent to return at least one step back, before getting too far from its starting point. When the agent returns to a state it had previously experienced, going in the same deviation-increasing direction will be less likely than the first time (i.e., than 50\u201350), since the agent has already experienced the punishment caused by that state\u2013action pair once. Repetition of this process results in the agent gradually getting more and more attracted to the setpoint, without ever having experienced internal states that are beyond a certain limit (i.e. the brink of death)."

Also, simulating 10<sup>5</sup> agents over 1500 trials (starting from state 30) shows that the mean value of the internal state across all agents converges to the setpoint (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), and its variance converges to a steady-state level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This shows that all agents stay within certain bounds around the setpoint (The maximum deviation from the setpoint among all the 10<sup>5</sup> agents over the 1500 trials was 61). Also, this property of the model is shown to be insensitive to the parameters of the model, like the initial internal state (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), the rate of exploration (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), or the discount factor (<a href=\"#fig6s6\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 6,7</a>). These parameters only affect the rate of convergence or the distribution over visited states, but not the general property of never-visiting-drastic-deviations (existence of a boundary). Moreover, this property can be generalized to multi-dimensional homeostatic spaces. Therefore, our theory suggests a potential normative explanation for how animals (who might be a priori na\u00efve about potential dangers of certain internal states) would learn to avoid extreme physiological instability, without ever exploring how good or bad they are."

This proposition is compatible with the fact that dopamine neurons exhibit instantaneous, rather than delayed, burst activity in response to unexpected food reward (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schneider, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>). Moreover, it might provide a formal explanations for the experimental fact that intravenous injection (and even intragastric intubation, in some cases) of food is not rewarding even though its drive reduction effect is equal to when it is ingested orally (<a href=\"#bib34\">Miller &amp; Kessen, 1952</a>) (See also <a href=\"#bib43\">Ren et al., 2010</a>). In fact, if the post-ingestive effect of food is estimated by its sensory properties, the reinforcing value of intravenously injected food that lacks sensory aspects will be effectively zero. In the same line of reasoning, the theory suggests that animals' motivation toward palatable foods, such as saccharine, that have no caloric content (and thus no need-reduction effect) is due to erroneous over-estimation of their drive-reduction capacity, misguided by their taste or smell. Note that the rationality of our theory, as shown in <a href=\"#equ5\">Equation 5</a>, holds only as long as <math id=\"inf37\"><mrow><msub><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>K</mi><mo>^</mo></mover></mrow><mi>t</mi></msub></mrow></math> is an unbiased estimation of <math id=\"inf38\"><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>t</mi></msub></mrow></math>.

Two groups of water-deprived animals learned to press a green key to self-administer water orally. After this pre-training session, pressing the green key had no consequence anymore, whereas pressing a novel yellow key resulted in the oral delivery of water in one group, and intragastric (through a fistula) delivery of water in the second group. Results showed that the green key gradually extinguished in both groups (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). During this time, responding on the yellow key in the oral group initially increased but then gradually extinguished (rise-fall pattern; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The second group, however, showed no motivation for the yellow key (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This shows that only oral, but not intragastric, self-administration of water is reinforcing for thirsty animals. Our model accounts for these behavioral dynamics."

As for the yellow key, the oral agent initially increases the rate of responding (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) as the subjective probability of receiving water upon pressing the yellow key increases (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Gradually, however, the internal state of the animal reaches the homeostatic setpoint (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>), resulting in diminishing motivation (thirst-reduction effect) of seeking water (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>).

This apparently circular argument relies on the hypothetical and out-of-reach axiom of reward-maximization as the behavioral objective of animals. Physiological stability, however, is an observable fact. Here, we develop a coherent mathematical theory where physiological stability is put as the basic axiom, and reward is defined in physiological terms. We demonstrated that reinforcement learning algorithms under such a definition of physiological reward lead to optimal policies that both maximize reward collection and minimize homeostatic needs. This argues for behavioral rationality of physiological integrity maintenance and further shows that temporal discounting of rewards is paramount for homeostatic maintenance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that such integration of the two systems can account for several behavioral phenomena, including anticipatory responding, the rise-fall pattern of food-seeking response, risk-aversion, and competition between motivational systems. Here we argue that our framework may also shed light on the computational role of the interaction between the brain reward circuitry and the homeostatic regulation system; namely, the modulation of midbrain dopaminergic activity by hypothalamic signals."

Accordingly, orexin neurons are suggested to act as an interface between internal states and the reward learning circuit (<a href=\"#bib40\">Palmiter, 2007</a>). In parallel with the orexinergic pathway, ghrelin, leptin and insulin receptors are also expressed on the VTA dopamine neurons, providing a further direct interface between the HR and RL systems.

Systemic administration of opioid antagonists decreases subjective pleasantness rating and affective responses for palatable foods in humans (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yeomans &amp; Wright, 1991</a>) and rats (<a href=\"#bib18\">Doyle et al., 1993</a>), respectively.

However, major criticisms have been leveled against this theory over the years (<a href=\"#bib33\">McFarland, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Savage, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berridge, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Speakman et al., 2011</a>). Here we propose that our formal theory alleviates some of major faults of the classical drive-reduction. Firstly, the classical drive-reduction does not explain anticipatory responding in which animals paradoxically voluntarily increase (rather than decrease) their drive deviation, even in the absence of any physiological deficit. As we demonstrated, such apparently maladaptive responses are optimal in terms of both reward-seeking and ensuring physiological stability, and are thus acquired by animals."

In the same line, the two theories use different mathematical tools as their optimization techniques. The free energy approach uses variational Bayes inference. Thus, rationality in that model is bounded by the simplifying assumptions for doing \u2018approximate\u2019 inference (namely, factorization of the variational distribution over some partition of the latent variables, Laplace approximation, etc.). Our approach, however, depends on tools from optimal control theory and thus, rationality is constrained by the capabilities and weaknesses of the variants of the RL algorithm being used (e.g. model-based vs. model-free RL). In this sense, while the notion of reward is redundant in the free energy formulation, and physiological stability is achieved through gradient descent function, homeostasis in our model can only be achieved through computing reward. In fact, the associative learning component in our model critically depends on receiving the approximated reward from the upstream regulatory component.

In this framework, anticipated demands increase current homeostatic deviation (by adjusting the setpoint level) and thus, prepare the organism to meet the predicted need. Again, the concept of reward is redundant in this model and motivated behaviors are directly controlled by homeostatic deviation, rather than by <i>a priori</i> computed and reinforced rewarding values."

According to this theory, by viewing organisms as dynamical systems, what looks like a homeostatic setpoint is just the stable state of the system caused by a balance of different opposing effectors on the internal variables. However, one should notice that mathematically, such dynamical systems can be re-formulated as a homeostatically regulated system, by writing down a potential functional for the system (or an energy function). Such an energy function is equivalent to our drive function whose setpoint corresponds to the settling point of the dynamical system formulation. Thus, there is equivalence between the two methods, and the setpoint approach summarizes the outcome of the underlying dynamical system on the regulated variables. Note that nothing precludes our framework to treat the setpoint conceptually as maintained internally by an underlying system of effectors and regulators. However, the setpoint/drive-function formulation conveniently allows us to derive our normative theory."

According to the classical models, the corrective response (lever-press) is performed when the internal state drops below the setpoint. Thus, during the first hour, the agent responds with a stable rate (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12E,F</a>) in order maintain the internal state above the setpoint (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12D</a>). Upon decreasing the dose, the agent waits until the internal state again drops below the setpoint. Thereafter, the agent presses the lever with a new rate, corresponding to the new dose.

Thus, right after the dose is decreased, the agent still expects to receive a big outcome upon pressing the lever. Therefore, as the objective is to minimize deviation from the setpoint (rather that staying above the setpoint), the agent waits for a period equal to the normal inter-infusion interval of the 1 g unit-dose. During this period, the internal state reaches the same lower bound as in previous trials (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A</a>). Afterward, when the agent presses the lever for the first time, it receives an unexpectedly small outcome, which is not sufficient for reaching the setpoint. Thus, several further responses will be needed to reach the setpoint, resulting in a burst of responding after decreasing the unit dose (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B,C</a>). After the setpoint is achieved, the agent presses the lever with a lower (-than-burst) rate, in order to keep the internal state close to the setpoint. In sum, in contrast to the classical HR models, our theory predicts a temporary burst of self-administration after dose reduction (See <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 12\u2014source data 1</a> for simulation details)."

Also, relaxing the assumption that the setpoint is fixed and making it adaptive to the animal's experiences could explain tolerance (as elevated perception of desired setpoint) and thus, drug addiction and obesity. Furthermore, relaxing the restrictive functional form of the drive function and introducing more general forms could explain behavioral patterns that our model does not yet account for, like asymmetric risk-aversion toward gains vs. losses (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</a>)."

Being inspired by the classic drive-reduction theory of motivation, our mathematical treatment allows for quantitative results to be obtained, predictions that make the theory testable, and logical coherence. The theory, with its set of formal assumptions and proofs, does not purport to explain the full gamut of animal behavior, yet we believe it to be a credible step toward developing a coherent mathematical framework to understand behaviors that depend on motivations stemming from internal states and needs of the individual. Furthermore, this work puts forth a meta-hypothesis that a number of apparently irrational behaviors regain their rationality if the internal state of the individual is taken into account. Among others, the relationship between our learning-based theory and evolutionary processes that shape animal a priori preferences and influence behavioral patterns remains a key challenge."

One could equally suggest that applying predictive coding to homeostatic deviations (prediction errors about their set point) is a plausible explanation for the empirical findings.

I stress predictive coding because there is a lot of work on homeostasis and interoceptive inference based upon predictive coding (within the larger setting of minimising variational free energy). For example, Anil Seth has a several articles that you might want to refer to. I think you also need to discuss the intellectual background to your work in cybernetics (and more recently synergetics). A key example here would be the good regulator theorem stemming from the work of Ross Ashby on self organisation and his notion of a homeostat. A more recent (and possibly heuristic) formulation of these ideas can be found in the literature on allostasis. I notice that you refer to allostasis in the last sentence of your paper (and also cite Peter Sterling). However, you never define the distinction between allostasis and homeostasis and how this relates to the anticipatory aspects of your formulation (e.g., temporal discounting within control theory)."

Temporal discounting coefficients and other arbitrary parameters (for example the n and m in <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>) are characteristic of reinforcement learning models, which undermines their normative status. I am assuming here that normative means that one can describe a process in terms of optimising an objective function. However, adding ad hoc parameters to the function destroys any uniqueness or optimality properties of the normative explanation. An example of this is the temporal discounting factor that your treatment emphasises. In normative Bayesian accounts, this reflects the precision of random fluctuations in hierarchical or volatility models of contingencies. Crucially, for any given outcomes, there is a Bayes-optimal temporal discounting that renders the Bayesian description truly normative."

As a minimum, I think you should discuss the good regulator theorem and early cybernetic formulations. I think you should also mention the notion of interoceptive inference or prediction as a relevant example of more generic Bayesian approaches. You may find useful references in the following:"

The quantity that is optimised is the expected reward at each point (in free energy formulations this would be the path integral).

The intuitive explanation for extinction bursts is that the animal expects a reward and when it does not arrive, continues to work/press because prior learning does not unravel (or update) that quickly, especially if reward was stochastic in the first place (and, well, the animal is still hungry). The suggestion that a mouse that does not get a reward after pressing the lever 10 times would, as a result, be in a physiological state significantly further from setpoint that this increases their responding seems unlikely. If the mouse presses the lever 10x in 2 minutes (slow for a well-trained mouse), then the mouse's hunger state would only be increased by 2 min metabolism, but mouse behavior is not that regimented nor does receiving a pellet significantly reduce pressing when not in extinction (would you expect to see increased responding if you put the mouse in 2 min later today than yesterday?)"

In the anticipatory responding section, the authors argue that their model explains why an animal would respond in the absence of a deficit state: the animal has previously learned that a cue or action is rewarding, i.e., that it is associated with relieving a deficit state. Thus, the authors argue, that learning induces the animal to respond even when not in a deficit state. But this is, in fact, precisely what incentive salience is: that animals learn the value of stimuli and that this learned value induces responding in the absence of an actual deficit state. And, in fact when animals respond for such learned value, they are not motivated but a current deficit state (as drive-reduction would have) but by learned incentive, which is causing the behavior in the absence of such need. The authors have merely reinvented the incentive-salience wheel and don't appear to realize it."

There is much data suggesting that metabolic state and nutritional information is signaled in the brain (how could it not be?) and, moreover, that this impacts the dopamine system. However, the authors make a jump here and assume, without evidence, that this is a homeostatic system. Because metabolic information is signaled does not necessitate homeostasis. Equally important, as the authors are discussing the effect of metabolic state on dopamine signaling, a distinction between tonic and phasic needs to be made. So for example, tonic dopamine goes up and remains up for a period of time during a meal, how does this fit in with what should be decreased signaling as the state of the system moves toward the setpoint (i.e., with each bite)? In extinction bursts, the authors seem to suggest that this sort of micro, moment to moment variation in state is signaled. Is there evidence to support that hunger will change the magnitude of the reward?"

That, I think, could represent a substantial contribution if the authors could focus specifically on that and develop it in the context of contemporary models/problems. When they attempt to resolve one of the largest, most complex controversies in all of the history of psychology in one short manuscript, they fall into trouble. From the point of view of computational modeling, is this not simply a form of utility? How is it different from other models that have incorporated utility? This seems the more relevant context for developing and presenting the model. As for drive-reduction and rescuing Hull, surely Hull and his followers meant 'ideal_state MINUS current_state = motivation'?

This is an important and non-trivial result. The appendix provides a formal proof; however, the underlying idea is fairly simple. Imagine you had to plan a hill walk, during which you wanted to maximise the height (altitude or reward) averaged over the path you take. If someone dropped you at the bottom of the hill, the optimum path would be to ascend the hill and spend as long as possible at the top before returning to your pick up point. Notice that this entails ascending the hill (reward function) before descending. Implicit in this strategy is a maximisation of temporally discounted reward. In other words, going up the hill first and then coming down is better than going down and then coming back up. It is this fundamental (variational) phenomenon that connects homeostasis with classical temporal discounting."

From this perspective, one can regard the adaptive behaviours that we are trying to link as necessary and emergent properties of all dynamical systems that comply with (Hamilton's) principle of least action.

However, as we could best understand, the recent computation model of incentive salience separates value learning from influences of the internal state. The value is learned as in the standard RL algorithms (with respect to a reference state and based on externally defined rewards). The internal state at the time of the response then modifies the learned value. As we now argue in the manuscript such a formulation differs from our framework and is unable to account for anticipatory responses."

Interestingly, the concept of an internally regulated set point appears prominently in that body of literature. The classical review by Benzinger (2) establishes experimental evidence for a thermal set point as a physiological property and points out the role of the \u201cpreoptic-spraoptic region of the hypothalamus\u201d in central regulation of the body temperature. The suggestion that hypothalamic circuits play a role in maintenance of thermal homeostasis by translating sensed temperature into neural activity was formalized by Hammel (3) in a model proposing hypothalamic circuitry where integration of thermo-sensitive and thermo-insensitive neuronal activities could lead to dynamic encoding of the thermal setpoint. Populations of heat-sensitive neurons have been identified in the hypothalamus (4, 5): they increase firing rate with increasing body temperature. The heat-sensitive (HS) and heat-insensitive (HI) neurons synaptically innervate two sets of effector neurons. Heat-loss effectors are excited by the heat-sensitive cells and inhibited by the heat-insensitive cells in a manner that balances these inputs at 37C body temperature. Heat-production effector neurons are in turn inhibited by the HS neurons and excited by the HI neurons. Over the years, heat-loss/production effector neurons have been electrophysiologically identified (6\u20138) and anatomically mapped. The regulatory loop is closed by the thermosensory afferents from the periphery to the HS (but not the HI) neurons (e.g. see (9)). Manipulations of the POA induce body temperature changes (e.g. see (10)) and the effector neurons have been implicated in control of organismal thermoregulatory responses (e.g. as reviewed in Morrison and Nakamura (11) and Boulant (12)) including shivering (13). Furthermore, there is experimental evidence that the regulated thermal temperature point is influenced (or dynamically set) by signals that not in themselves directly related to temperature (e.g. hormonal levels, inputs from joint mechano-receptors receptors) and varies from individual to individual (see (12) for review)."

Thus, we respectfully beg to differ with the opinion of the reviewer, we believe that concepts we use do have connections to biological properties. For example the homeostatic space is simply a coordinate system where the various physiologically regulated quantities are represented: temperature, glucose levels, etc. Also, the setpoint is just equivalent to the stable equilibrium of the underlying dynamical system."

There is further evidence that inputs from such neurons, create cold-producing and heat-producing effector neurons (6\u20138).

Hence lack of discounting did not result in equivalence of reward maximization of homeostatic defense. Temporal discounting ensured that such did not happen and ensured the rationality of defending homeostasis. In view of the reviewers comments, we realized that our claim was overreaching and withdrew the claim that our normative explanation for temporal discounting is the only possible explanation.

Imagine you had to plan a hill walk, during which you wanted to maximise the height (altitude or reward) averaged over the path you take. If someone dropped you at the bottom of the hill, the optimum path would be to ascend the hill and spend as long as possible at the top before returning to your pick up point. Notice that this entails ascending the hill (reward function) before descending. Implicit in this strategy is a maximisation of temporally discounted reward. In other words, going up the hill first and then coming down is better than going down and then coming back up.
