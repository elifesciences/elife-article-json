Seed et al. looked at stool samples from two cholera patients (one from Haiti, one from Bangladesh) who had high viral loads of a type of vibriophage called ICP2. In each sample, they discovered that some of the bacteria were resistant to the phage, while the rest were sensitive to it. Then, Seed et al. sequenced the whole genomes of bacterial clones and discovered that the only differences between the phage-resistant and phage-sensitive isolates in each patient were clustered into a single gene. However, a different bacterial gene was mutated in each patient. Several different mutants of each gene were found. This strongly suggests that these mutations occurred, and were then selected for, in bacteria in the patient during the infection."

The OmpU protein forms a pore in the bacteria\u2019s outer membrane to enable nutrients to be imported into the cell. The bacteria need this protein for their survival both in human hosts and in environmental waters. Since the OmpU mutants are resistant to phage attack, Seed et al.\u2019s findings indicate that the OmpU protein is also used by the vibriophage ICP2 to infect the bacterial cells (i.e. it is also the \u2018receptor\u2019 for the ICP2 phage)."

Out of a collection of 54 clinical isolates of <i>V. cholerae</i> collected in Bangladesh between 2001 and 2011, 15% have similar phage-resistant mutations in the <i>ompU</i> gene. Seed et al. also found that the changes in the OmpU protein were all in parts of the protein that are exposed on the outside of the bacterial cell; and importantly, that they had very little effect on the fitness of <i>V. cholerae</i> in a range of tests. This is reminiscent of the relationship between the bacterium <i>E. coli</i> and the phage lambda, where mutations in a surface protein can make the bacteria resistant to phage attack. These mutations also occur in a surface-exposed part of the protein and do not affect the other functions of this protein (<a href=\"#bib4\">Gehring et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Hofnung, 1995</a>). However, the <i>E. coli/</i>phage lambda studies were performed in the laboratory, whereas this <i>V. cholerae</i> study appears to be the first report that suggests a predator-prey relationship between phage and bacteria in the human intestine."

All of these mutations were in a gene called <i>toxR,</i> which encodes a protein that regulates the expression of numerous genes, including <i>ompU.</i> Since these ToxR mutants do not produce the phage\u2019s receptor\u2014the OmpU protein\u2014this confers resistance to phage attack. However, the ToxR protein also regulates genes that control the virulence of the bacteria, and the ToxR mutants were unable to start new infections in an animal model of cholera. Therefore, in contrast with the OmpU mutants, it is more difficult to unambiguously assign the selection of ToxR mutants as resulting solely from defending against phage attack. Instead the selection of these non-infectious mutants could also be explained by such mutations making it \u2018cheaper\u2019 for these bacteria to grow in the digestive tract at the expense of the virulent clones."

Expressing so-called virulence proteins or factors is costly for an individual bacterium, and mutants that stop making these factors can, therefore, benefit at the expense of other bacteria that continue to do so. This advantage, however, is only short-lived as these less virulent mutants are unable to start new infections themselves. Regardless of the precise mechanism, the selection for the non-infectious ToxR mutants observed by Seed et al. suggests that phage predation may have contributed to the collapse of the infection and the selection of less virulent strains."
