Then, these duct-like cells transform into cancer precursor cells and, in time, become cancer cells. This cancerous transformation is associated with the presence of a form of the <i>Kras</i> gene that causes cells to divide more often (known as the <i>Kras</i> oncogene). Experimentally, the transformation of the duct-like cells into a cancerous form is modelled in mice that are engineered to express the <i>Kras</i> oncogene. These mice develop small pre-cancerous lesions in their pancreas that only arise from a small subset of the acinar cells, despite mutant Kras expression in all cells."

They reasoned that PTF1A, a protein that regulates the differentiation of acinar cells from precursor cells during pancreas development is similarly required to maintain the identity of the acinar cells in the adult pancreas. Thus, PTF1A could protect against the <i>Kras</i>-mediated transformation of the cells to a pre-cancerous cell type by preventing ADM. This hypothesis was based on previous studies of other molecules that regulate differentiation and guide the development of acinar cells, because these so-called \u201cacinar differentiation factors\u201d have been seen to protect against <i>Kras</i>-mediated transformation. Furthermore, inactivating these differentiation factors promotes the ADM process (<a href=\"#bib6\">Shi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">von Figura et al., 2014</a>)."

Expressing the <i>Kras</i> oncogene in these mice caused precursor lesions to form more rapidly and over a wider area of the pancreas than those seen in mice whose acinar cells expressed both PTF1A and oncogenic <i>Kras</i>. Together, these data show that acinar cells must lose PTF1A before they can undergo ADM, and thus become susceptible to <i>Kras</i>-induced transformation."

The next open question is whether forced expression of PTF1A in the pancreas protects against <i>Kras</i>-induced transformation; this has already been shown to be the case for a different acinar cell factor called Mist1 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Direnzo et al., 2012</a>). Further open questions include what it is that causes the accelerated rate at which ADM progresses to precursor lesions in mice that express oncogenic <i>Kras</i> and lack PTF1A (compared with mice that do express PTF1A). Since PTF1A is normally lost during the process of ADM, the absence of this protein cannot explain the accelerated rate of cancer progression. It is possible that in mice that carry oncogenic <i>Kras</i> and still retain intact PTF1A, an equilibrium between acinar cells and ADM cells occurs, whereby ADM cells can \u2018choose\u2019 to re-express PTF1A and return to an acinar fate, or progress to form pre-cancerous lesions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This equilibrium would be lost in mice lacking PTF1A, where cells that have undergone ADM have no choice other than to progress towards becoming cancerous. Furthermore, the effect PTF1A re-expression has in pre-cancerous lesions as well as in advanced disease merits further exploration."

Acinar cells in the pancreas (left) express the differentiation factors PTF1A, Mist1 and Nr5a2 (blue). Krah et al. show that loss of PTF1A causes acinar de-differentiation in a process known as acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM; centre). In the presence of oncogenic <i>Kras</i>, ADM leads to the formation of precancerous lesions (right) and, in time, cancer. Other factors have also been shown to be important in regulating the balance between cell differentiation and cancer: Mist1 and Nr5a2, expressed in normal acinar cells, protect from transformation. Conversely, factors that control ductal fate, including Sox9 and Pdx1, can push acinar cells toward a ductal state and accelerate the rate at which cancerous cells develop (red arrows; <a href=\"#bib2\">Kopp et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Miyatsuka et al., 2006</a>)."
