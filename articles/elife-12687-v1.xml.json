Improving their resolution is thus a key challenge that warrants understanding its origin through appropriate animal models. Here, we provide a systematic comparison between visual and prosthetic activations of the rat primary visual cortex (V1). We established a precise V1 mapping as a functional benchmark to demonstrate that sub-retinal implants activate V1 at the appropriate position, scalable to a wide range of visual luminance, but with an aspect-ratio and an extent much larger than expected. Such distorted activation profile can be accounted for by the existence of two sources of diffusion, passive diffusion and activation of ganglion cells\u2019 axons <i>en passant</i>. Reverse-engineered electrical pulses based on impedance spectroscopy is the only solution we tested that decreases the extent and aspect-ratio, providing a promising solution for clinical applications."

Improving their resolution is thus a key challenge that warrants understanding its origin through appropriate animal models. Here, we provide a systematic comparison between visual and prosthetic activations of the rat primary visual cortex (V1). We established a precise V1 mapping as a functional benchmark to demonstrate that sub-retinal implants activate V1 at the appropriate position, scalable to a wide range of visual luminance, but with an aspect-ratio and an extent much larger than expected. Such distorted activation profile can be accounted for by the existence of two sources of diffusion, passive diffusion and activation of ganglion cells\u2019 axons <i>en passant</i>. Reverse-engineered electrical pulses based on impedance spectroscopy is the only solution we tested that decreases the extent and aspect-ratio, providing a promising solution for clinical applications."

Both the micro-electrodes and the natural stimuli activated the same areas of the brain. However, the micro-electrodes produced larger and more elongated patterns of activation. This is because the electrical currents generated by the micro-electrodes diffused throughout the retinal tissue and activated other neurons besides those intended. To overcome this problem, Roux et al. tested different ways of stimulating the micro-electrodes in order to identify those that induce the desired patterns of brain activity. This approach \u2013 known as reverse engineering \u2013 did indeed improve the performance of the micro-electrode array."

In this perspective, retinal prostheses provide a promising solution that remains to date a unique alternative for the patients. Restoring some visual perception using implants has been already achieved (<a href=\"#bib28\">Humayun et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shepherd et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zrenner et al., 2010</a>)\u00a0but still offers insufficient gains in visual acuity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Humayun et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zrenner et al., 2010</a>); (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nanduri et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rizzo, 2003</a>). Despite having fundamentally different designs and operating modes, the two main models of prostheses proposed to the patients with RP (Argus II epiretinal prosthesis and the subretinal alpha IMS microphotodiode array) restore some visual function although with a spatial resolution (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahuja and Behrend, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Humayun et al., 2012</a>); (<a href=\"#bib68\">Stingl et al., 2013</a>) that does not allow for the recognition of faces or autonomous locomotion.

To improve the resolution and efficiency of retinal prosthesis, it is therefore necessary to launch appropriate models that allow probing precisely and quantitatively the functional impact of prosthetic activation. Pioneering animal studies have proposed to use cortical recordings to explore the efficiency of various patterns of retinal electrical stimulation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chowdhury et al., 2008</a>), including current steering methods (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jepson et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Matteucci et al., 2013</a>) or the effect of the return electrode configuration (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cicione et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Matteucci et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wong et al., 2009</a>)\u00a0and studied the temporal aspect of prosthetic vision (<a href=\"#bib14\">Elfar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fransen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jepson et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nadig, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Schanze et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sekirnjak et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Wilms et al., 2003</a>).

To infer the hypothetic visual counterparts induced by electrical stimulation, we first established a quantitative mapping of the cartographic organization of the rat visual system. So far only Gias and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gias et al., 2004</a>) have provided a retinotopic description of the rat visual cortex using optical imaging. Here, we generalized this mapping to visual parameters that are the most important for prosthetic vision (position, size and intensity). Using this cartographic benchmark, we demonstrate that prosthetic stimulation generates a functional activation that occurs at the expected retinotopic location and amplitude. However, the aspect ratio and the extent of the activation are significantly larger than expected. This can be explained through a simple model with two sources of diffusion: an electrical passive diffusion and the activation of axons en passant from ganglion cells. To control the extent of cortical activation, we tested various patterns of electrical stimulation and showed that only reverse engineering of the electrical pulses to inject the desired electrical stimulation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dupont et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pham et al., 2013</a>) allowed focalizing the activation.

Animals were also implanted sub-retinally with a MEA and its retinal position was identified using fundus imaging (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,G</a>), reported in the visual (A,E) and cortical domains (B,D,F,H), respectively. In the first animal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> top row), we stimulated the whole MEA (wMEA), the size of which (1 mm) was in the range of the size of the stimuli used for visual retinotopic mapping (20\u00b0) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hughes, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Palagina et al., 2009</a>). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> right shows the cortical activation generated by such electrical stimulation at \u00b1 150 \u00b5A (red contour).

We then tested single electrode stimulation (SE, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013H</a> shows an example in another animal for two individual electrodes each stimulated at \u00b1 200 \u00b5A. The evoked activations for the two SE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> middle and right maps, cyan and purple) were about the size of the 20\u00b0 visual activation (left map, white) and their positions within the activation generated by the corresponding visual stimulus covering their retinal positions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). To generalize these observations, we computed the retino-cortical magnification factors by measuring the cortical distance between the centers of activation (white circles) elicited by visual stimuli displayed at different positions. Across 20 animals, the cortical distance between activations was plotted against the distance separating the visual stimuli (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). We observed a linear increase of cortical distance with visual distance, at a rate of 22 \u00b5m/\u00b0 (in accordance with the literature) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gias et al., 2004</a>). For all activations (visual and electrical), we used this value to estimate the error (in mm and equivalent degree of visual angle, \u00b0<sup>eq</sup>) between the position of the activity\u2019s center-of-mass and its expected position within the retinotopic map. Visually evoked activations provided an approximation of the inherent variability of that measure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>, gray dots). On average, the cortical error was 0.32 \u00b1 0.22 mm for visual stimuli, 72% of the data points falling within the retinotopic representation of the 20\u00b0 stimulus (&lt;0.44 mm). The same measure was applied to electrically evoked activations for SE and wMEA stimulations. For SE, the estimation of the position of the evoked activity was quite accurate (error of 0.46 \u00b1 0.27 mm), 55% of evoked responses falling within the retinotopic expected position. Note that these error values are actually over-estimated since in practice, the implant was not obligatory located at the exact same retinal position that corresponds to the visual stimulus. Finally, wMEA activations yielded responses with more variable and less accurate position than SE with an average error of 0.68 \u00b1 0.47 mm, 38% of the evoked positions being within the expected representation."

We thus quantified this effect by systematically comparing the extents of the visually and artificially evoked activations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). As shown in the example of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, the extent of cortical activation linearly increased with visual stimulus size with an average slope of 81 \u00b5m/\u00b0 when estimated at population level (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, N\u00a0=\u00a07). In comparison, the active surface diameters of the SE and wMEA were of 0.05 and 0.65 mm (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) equivalent to 1 and 11\u00b0 of visual angle (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hughes, 1979</a>), respectively. Although the visual stimuli covered a larger region of the retina (20\u00b0, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3C</a> top right), we observed a systematic and highly significant increase of the cortical activation extent induced by wMEA stimulation in 94% of the cases (17/18 conditions, 10 animals; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> legend for details on statistical procedures), with an average increase of 2.9 \u00b1 2.01 times the activation extent of the visual stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, thin gray lines). Please note that for this analysis, all electrical stimulations were systematically paired with the closest visual stimulus used for retinotopic mapping (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, bottom maps). In comparison, SE stimulation led to an average activation size of 0.9 \u00b1 0.5 times their 20\u00b0 visual counterparts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Using the visual-size tuning function (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), we extracted the equivalent visual stimulus sizes that would have evoked such cortical activations. These values reached on average 24.4 \u00b1 10.6 and 32.2 \u00b1 11.5\u00b0 instead of 1 and 11\u00b0 for the SE and wMEA configurations, respectively. Electrical stimulation hence led to extremely large diffusion of the activation, comparatively larger for SE than wMEA. Such differences could be explained by several factors including (i) the extent of wMEA activation being sometimes underestimated because of the limit of the imaged region of interest and (ii) the close proximity of the annular counter-electrode (reference) in wMEA constraining lateral diffusion of the current (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cicione et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pham et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wong et al., 2009</a>). Our results unambiguously demonstrate that prosthetic retinal stimulation generates too large activation to obtain the necessary independence between electrodes; an inter-electrode spacing of at least 0.8 to 1.2 mm on the retina, at low- and high-intensity respectively, would be required to yield non-overlapping cortical activations."

                                "text": "Next we compared the shape of cortical activations to visual and prosthetic stimulations, because it may help understanding the origin of the spread. When compared to visual stimulus (white), we generally observed elongated cortical activation for SE (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> blue) but not for wMEA (red) stimulation. In order to quantify this elongation, we computed the aspect ratio (AR) of activation contours at the level of the population (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Using pairwise visual-prosthetic comparison, we found a highly significant (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> legend) increase in the aspect ratio of the evoked activations for SE condition compared to their visual counterparts (1.66 \u00b1 0.43 <i>vs.</i> 1.35 \u00b1 0.19) but none for wMEA. These elongations could be caused by the recruitment of ganglion cells\u2019 axons <i>en passant</i> leading to oriented anisotropic cortical activations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> right). However, why would SE activation yield stronger AR than wMEA? One explanation is that the ganglion cell neurons with axons that will be activated <i>en passant</i>, all converging radially towards the optic disk, are all located upstream to the electrode within a 'shadow cone' with a top angle that will (i) decrease with the distance between the implant and the optic disk location and (ii) increase with the size of the stimulated retinal surface (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In a simple functional model (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), we combined the predictions of what should be the shape and size of retinal activations due to local and <i>en passant</i> activation. Isotropic 'direct' activations were modeled as a Gaussian activation around the site of stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> left column) for different electrode sizes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, rows). Anisotropic <i>en passant</i> recruitment of ganglion cell axons was modeled as a shadow cone activation, i.e. all peripheral ganglion somata whose axons have been activated by the electrical stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, middle column, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> for details in the model, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). <i>Via</i> a weighted sum, we combined these two activations (right column and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> insets) with different ratios (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>: 0.5 &amp; C: 1). From these predicted activations, we extracted similar parameters (size, position, elongation) as we did from our cortical recordings. Since our interest is to predict the effect of axon-en-passant activation on radial elongation, we used the following convention for the AR: the numerator is the length of activation along the radial axis and the denominator is the length of activation along a tangential axis (perpendicular to the radial axis). This model predicted that the resulting retinal activation should indeed be more elongated along radial axis for smaller cone angle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, AR &gt;\u00a01), this effect being stronger when we increase the relative contribution of en passant activation. The model further predicts that the retinal activation should become more elongated along a tangential axis for very large cone angle (AR\u00a0&lt;\u00a01). Please note that these predictions are left unchanged if we apply a retino-cortical transformation to the simulated activations (see <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). To test for these predictions, we plotted the aspect-ratio of the activation across animals and experimental conditions as a function of the retinal 'shadow cone' angle formed by the stimulated surface (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Please note that, to account for any potential deformation of the evoked activity due to retino-cortical magnification factor (see <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) or physiological noise, we normalized all electrically-induced AR to their corresponding visual AR. In this plot we observed a similar decrease of the aspect ratio with the cone angle, confirming our predictions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Our results thus suggest that the difference we observed between wMEA and SE is explained if we make the hypothesis that part of the functional activation of the visual system comes from of axons <i>en passant</i> recruitment. Note that our model suggests that the isotropy observed for wMEA activations simply results from the geometrical arrangement between the electrode size and the shadow cone. We thus conclude that wMEA activations are still suffering from contamination by the activation of fibers en passant. Hence SE simulation remains the best configuration to achieve the highest performance in spatial resolution. According to our simple model, the relative contribution of axons <i>en passant</i> to the global prosthetic activation should be of the same order of magnitude as direct activation (alpha = 1, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods: model of retinal activation)."

                                "text": "Thus, the predictions that arise from this observation are: for small cone angle (i) the elongation of the cortical activation should be radially organized towards the representation of the optic disk and (ii) the activation should be anisotropic, attracted by the radial elongation towards more eccentric positions (i.e. away from the optic disk representation); lastly (iii) for large cone angle, cortical activation should be more elongated along a tangential axis. To test for these predictions, we pooled together all activation profiles that were sufficiently elongated, i.e. with an AR above 1.6, and plotted them in cortical space (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In this figure, each solid segment corresponds to the orientation of a cortical activation. The dark disk is the cortical position that optimized the radial arrangement of the observed orientations (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Observed orientations of cortical activation deviated from an optimal radial organization (dashed lines) to this cortical position by only 13.3\u00b0 (median value across N\u00a0=\u00a020 activations). Importantly, this cortical position is close to, and in the same direction as, the median position of the optic disk (gray disk). This latter one was estimated from 16 experiments whenever its mapping was possible. However, we could not use it systematically because of imprecision in its estimation (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). We then checked whether this result could occur by chance. For that purpose, we generated 1000 random distributions of orientations at the observed positions and, for each, looked for the cortical position that optimized radial arrangement (as described above). For this position, we computed the median angular deviation between the random orientations and the\u00a0optimal radial arrangement to this position. This led to a Gaussian distribution of median angular deviation expected by chance in our particular configuration, with a mean of 23.6 \u00b1 4.9\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> inset). Our observation of 13.3\u00b0 (red line) is significantly smaller than what would be expected by chance (p=0.02, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). To test for the second prediction of anisotropic activation that our model raised, we compared the center-of-mass of the activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> red dot) to the geometric center (dashed and solid line crossing). Indeed if the activity is attracted away from the blind-spot, the center-of-mass must be delocalized from the geometrical center, opposite to the position of the blind-spot. We plotted the position of the center-of-mass (red points in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), and indeed observed that it was pushed away from the optic disk representation. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> present a centered, reoriented and zoomed view on all deviations of the center-of-mass (red disk) to the geometrical center (center of the representation) within the same reference frame (horizontal dashed axis being the radial organization). Center-of-masses all deviated away from the optic disk with an averaged angular deviation of \u2212168\u00b0 (opposite deviation being 180\u00b0). To better illustrate this deviation, we averaged all the maps under consideration in this analysis, after realignment along the radial axis (the axis linking the activation to the BS, here the BS is to the right) and centering (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> bottom left). We can see from this averaged map that there is indeed a radially elongated and anisotropic activation opposite to the representation of the blind spot (dotted contour represent activation higher than 4.5 z-score). For comparison, we made similar averaging on all the other maps in response to SE (with an aspect-ratio &lt; 1.6) and wMEA. For SE activation with low AR, the result shows an activation that is more isotropic. For MEA activation, the averaged map shows, as predicted, a slight elongation along the tangential axis. Hence, in our experimental observations, the radial arrangement and deviation of the center-of-mass of the activation behave as expected from an activation of en-passant axons in the retina."

Increasing luminance non-linearly increased the cortical activation size and amplitude (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Across the population (N\u00a0=\u00a08), we fitted the response amplitude (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) with a Naka-Rushton function (<a href=\"#bib47\">Naka and Rushton, 1966</a>) for the whole population (black dotted line), as well as for each animal individually (thin gray lines). The luminance of semi-saturation was 9.6 \u00b1 2.9 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. We then compared these results with the intensity of electrical stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a>) that similarly modulated the cortical activations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Over 35 animals (wMEA: 10, SE: 25), we observed a gradual increase of response amplitude for both wMEA and SE electrical stimulation, well captured by Naka-Rushton fits (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a>, thick dotted lines). The intensity of semi-saturation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>) was significantly lower for SE than for wMEA (20.29 \u00b1 3.25 \u00b5A <i>vs.</i> 52.66 \u00b1 17.35 \u00b5A, see legend for details on statistical procedure). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> compares the exponent of the individual fits performed on the amplitude parameter for visual, SE and wMEA stimulation. Steep transitions were observed for wMEA (n\u00a0=\u00a05.58 \u00b1 3.54) and for visual luminance (n\u00a0=\u00a06.05 \u00b1 3.01) whereas more gradual transitions were observed for SE (n\u00a0=\u00a01.34 \u00b1 0.6) which significantly differed from wMEA and visual stimuli (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> legend). As a consequence, the operating range (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) of the intensity response function in visual stimulation was on average 9.2 \u00b1 4.8 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, 82.5 \u00b1 88.4 \u00b5A for wMEA and much broader for SE (182.6 \u00b1 151.4 \u00b5A). This is further reflected in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a> plotting the hypothetic equivalent luminance of electrical activations. We estimated the equivalent visual luminance that corresponds to the response amplitude evoked by electrical stimulation using the Naka-Rushton fit (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The functional operating range induced by current intensity manipulation allowed generating an artificial activation with an equivalent luminance that could theoretically be in the range of 2\u201350 cd/m<sup>2</sup>."

This clearly impairs the functional efficiency of the implants. We therefore took advantage of our experimental design to seek solutions for controlling the spatial extent of the functional activation. Several candidate parameters have been investigated for SE stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>, respectively blue vs. green colors): polarity (cathodic vs. anodic pulse first, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>), symmetry vs. asymmetry of the biphasic square pulse (<a href=\"#bib41\">McIntyre and Grill, 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D</a>) and regular pulses vs. electrical impedance spectroscopy-based (IS) adaptation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dupont et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In the example shown and over the population (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>), our results showed that the polarity of symmetric biphasic pulses did not significantly influence the extent of the cortical activation for the two intensity levels tested. However, the polarity was found to have a significant effect in asymmetric pulses delivered at 200 \u00b5A (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D</a>). The combination of asymmetric with anodic-first stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> top right) generated smaller activation of 1.66 \u00b1 0.71 mm corresponding to 17.12 \u00b1 8.11\u00b0<sup>eq</sup> (N\u00a0=\u00a07), smaller than the three other combinations. However, this reduction was not systematic (70% of the cases compared to the symmetrical pulse) and small (20.43% \u00b1 54.32, the corresponding [20-50-80] percentiles being [34.78\u201332.93\u201363.89]%). Please note that this negative result is the outcome of thorough manipulation of key parameters of the electrical stimulation and highlight the high variability of the changes induced. Our best result at this stage is obtained by combining the polarity and the asymmetry parameters."

                                "text": "One general issue encountered when injecting current or voltage in a tissue, and often ignored, is that the desired pattern to be injected can be strongly distorted by the non-ohmic properties of the electrode-tissue interface (<a href=\"#bib22\">Geddes, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pham et al., 2013</a>). In a previous study (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pham et al., 2013</a>), we indeed showed that the impedance phase and magnitude of the electrode-retina interface was found to be highly capacitive, yielding strong distortion of the applied stimulus (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, left bottom) and lateral diffusion of the injected pattern. Our rationale was therefore to use the characterization of the physical properties of the electrode-tissue interface to calibrate through reverse engineering methods what needs to be injected to obtain the desired pattern in the tissue. To do so, we characterized the impedance spectrogram of selected SE of each implantation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pham et al., 2013</a>). Using an equivalent electronic circuit accounting for the observed non-ohmic behavior, we simulated (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for details on the procedure) the adapted pattern of voltage injection (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, top right) that will generate the desired pattern shape in the implanted tissue (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dupont et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, right bottom). Note that, for this protocol only, we switched from current to voltage injection and that the low voltage level used here was of the same order of magnitude as the high current level used in the previous protocols. For 100% and 88% of the low and high voltage level cases respectively (5 V<sub>pp</sub> and 12 V<sub>pp,</sub> V<sub>pp</sub>: Volts peak-to-peak), the adapted pattern injected through SE decreased the extent of the activation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> top maps &amp; 7C). This significant decrease (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> legend) varied on average from 36 \u00b1 32% to 20.7 \u00b1 29.2% at low and high voltage, respectively (the corresponding [20-50-80] percentiles were [11.78\u201327.50\u201359.05] and [1.89\u20136.56\u201339.67]%). Importantly, at high voltage it was not accompanied by a significant change in response amplitude (Wilcoxon rank sum test: p=0.546, n\u00a0=\u00a08, N\u00a0=\u00a04), suggesting that this reduction of the extent was not simply explained by a change in activation strength level, allowing for an independent control of the extent (size) and the amplitude (intensity) of the evoked activity."

In detail, we have generated a precise mapping of the rodent cortical cartographical organization in response to position, size and intensity of visual stimuli. These cortical population maps were then used to establish a functional interpretation of the activations induced by electrical stimulation. The recording of robust and reliable electrically and visually evoked responses indicates that both types of information are efficiently transmitted to the primary visual cortex and prove the functional integrity of the retinal tissue after implantation, which was also anatomically confirmed by retinal imaging (OCT). Here we demonstrate that prosthetic stimulation generates a functional activation that occurs at the expected retinotopic location and amplitude but whose extent and aspect ratio are significantly larger than expected. To control the extent of cortical activation we tested various patterns of electrical stimulation and showed that supervised design of the electrical pulses -- taking into account the physical filtering properties of the electrode-retina interface -- allowed focalizing the activation."

Furthermore, the link between population activation in optical imaging and spiking discharge has long been established (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Das and Gilbert, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Shmuel and Grinvald, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Toth et al., 1996</a>). Lastly, a recent study showed that the spatial profile of cortical population activation in the awake monkey biases the shape of the evoked percept (<a href=\"#bib44\">Michel et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, we believe that the current approach is valid for an initial description of the functional activation of retinal prosthesis. The next step will be to launch experiments in behaving non-human primates, to clarify, in a model closer to humans, the relationship between the properties of the population prosthetic activation and the behavioral evaluation of the animal\u2019s percepts."

However, this measure was quite variable, as expected given the poor precision of the murine visual system (<a href=\"#bib15\">Euler and W\u00e4ssle, 1995</a>).

The threshold differences observed in wMEA and SE stimulation configurations can trivially result from difference in active electrode surface. However, our experiments unveiled that SE offers a larger operating range (182 <i>vs.</i> 82 \u00b5A for wMEA) to cover a theoretical modulation range of about 50 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. This result demonstrates that small electrode sizes will be more appropriate to make fine manipulation of stimulus intensity. Importantly, our results also revealed that the\u00a0increasing stimulus intensity increases both the response size and the response amplitude. This observation is crucial to consider since it will seriously challenge independent manipulation of those important parameters in prosthetic vision."

Hence, predicting how activation size of the population activity will be affected by anesthesia is not straightforward.

However, this increase in aspect ratio was not observed with wMEA. Using a simple model, we show that such difference in aspect ratio between stimulation conditions is actually to be expected because of differences in the spatial distribution of activation of axons en passant. Our model also allowed predicting that, to account for the observed spatial profiles, axons <i>en passant</i> should contribute to the same proportion than direct activation of the retina. In accordance with this prediction, we found that high aspect ratio activations distribute radially around the cortical representation of the blind spot and are asymmetrical, with center-of-masses displaced away from the blind spot representation. In contrast, Fransen <i>et al.</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fransen et al., 2014</a>) discard the possibility of direct RGCs activation through near infrared laser stimulation of photovoltaic subretinal array because of the absence of responses in the superior colliculus using inner retina synaptic blockers. However, several factors, including the low efficiency of photovoltaic transduction and the level of injected currents used in our study, might explain the differential recruitment of RGCs cell bodies and axons observed here using V1 population recordings."

Remarkably, all regular manipulations of the stimulation pattern moved the activation spatial profile along that inverse relationship. In contrast, visual activation does not display such correlation, the aspect-ratio being small and independent of activation size (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, gray dots). This relationship could therefore be taken as a diagnosis of the way electrical stimulation activates the retinal circuitry with lateral isotropic diffusion and anisotropic axons <i>en passant</i> activation. To mimic a functional visual activation, it is therefore needed to decrease both the extent and the aspect ratio of the prosthetic activation."

It has been shown in vitro (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jensen et al., 2005</a>)\u00a0that the use of single cathodic pulse lowers the threshold of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), lowers the latency of inner retina mediated RGCs response and targets more specifically RGCs cell bodies when compared to anodal pulses. As far as we know, only one study systematically examined the effect the polarity of charge balanced biphasic square pulses (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chowdhury et al., 2008</a>). Using an extraocular device, Chowdhury <i>et al.</i> did not find any significant effect of the pulse polarity on the threshold of V1 electrically evoked potentials. Similarly, we did not find any effect of the polarity on the size of cortical activations. Altogether, anodic asymmetric pulses were the best among classical stimulations to restrict cortical activations, although not systematically. This result contradicts the prediction of the pioneer modeling work of McIntyre &amp; Grill (<a href=\"#bib41\">McIntyre and Grill, 2000</a>), which predicts more focal activation for cathodic asymmetrical pulses using a cable model. To conclude, basic manipulation of the electrical pulses did not yield a systematic reduction of the spatial extent of the activation. Furthermore, when compared to the aspect ratio (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), it turns out that all these stimulation configurations lead to the same inverse relationship suggesting that all activated the retinal network through diffusion and axons <i>en passant</i>."

                                "text": "To further scrutinize optimal stimulation parameters, we have also used a more 'supervised' approach by adapting the shape of the desired retinal stimulation through impedance spectroscopy to account for the filtering properties of the electrode-tissue interface (resistive and capacitive components) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dupont et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pham et al., 2013</a>). Our results show that electrical stimulation adaptation systematically and accurately decreased the activation spread while preserving their location and amplitude, when compared to their paired controls. Crucially, it was the only configuration we tested whose decrease in extent was not accompanied by an increase in aspect ratio (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, filled circles), similarly to functional visual stimulation. This strongly suggests that such stimulation reduces both the electrical diffusion extent (although not completely) and the axons <i>en passant</i> activation. What is the origin of the reduction of electrical diffusion? This could arise from the change of the shape of the injected current, that activate less high frequencies (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) that increase the spread of the electrical diffusion and the current density magnitude (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pham et al 2013</a>). By which mechanisms axons-en-passant would be less activated? Two mechanisms are possible. First, this could be a consequence of the reduction of the electrical diffusion. Since we are positioned subretinally, reducing the diffusion will favor activation of elements closer to the electrode (photoreceptors, bipolar cells\u2026) compared to further away (ganglion cells). A second mechanism would originate from the fact that the duration of each adapted pulse (anodic or cathodic) in the tissue is much longer (1.2\u00a0ms on average) than the transients contained in the non-adapted pulses (0.2\u00a0ms on average). This can favor activation of cell bodies since axons have shorter chronaxie, generally some hundreds of microseconds, than cell bodies, generally several milliseconds (<a href=\"#bib43\">McIntyre and Grill, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Nowak and Bullier, 1998b</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">1998a</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Ranck, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stern et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tehovnik and Slocum, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">Histed et al., 2009</a>). This effect could be further amplified by the fact that the adapted pulse inside the tissue was also biphasic, cathodic phase first and asymmetrical in amplitude. According to the work of Mc Intyre &amp; Grill (<a href=\"#bib43\">McIntyre and Grill, 2002</a>), these are the conditions for which we can expect the threshold for activation to increase for axons and to decrease for the soma. It is thus expected that the adapted condition will lower the contribution of fiber-en-passant, since the amplitude of the current injected in the tissue was lower in adapted than in non-adapted mode. This is therefore a very promising solution getting closer to a more natural visual activation of the retinal network. Importantly, it is noteworthy to point out that this stimulation strategy can be easily embedded in already available commercial devices using small electronic circuits. Supervised adaptation of electrical pulse based on the electrical properties of the electrode-tissue interface is therefore a promising solution for retinal, but also probably, for\u00a0cochlear prosthetic stimulations and more generally for all neuro-stimulation applications."

Using a\u00a0similar approach, further investigations will have to probe the dynamical aspect of these prosthetic activation to better understand how to generate spatio-temporal activations in the visual pathway (<a href=\"#bib14\">Elfar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fried et al., 2006</a>) that are similar to the ones observed in response to natural stimuli. A further challenge will be to drive the stimulator to generate activity closer to the retina\u2019s natural neural code (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nirenberg and Pandarinath, 2012</a>), which may involve taking into account higher order correlations (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marre et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Marre and Botella, 2014</a>). All these strategic steps will greatly benefit from animal models such as the one used here. To conclude, our work demonstrates that pre-clinical studies are a necessary prerequisite to validate and improve the efficiency of retinal implants, equivalent to animal models that are the foundation of any drug development for human pharmacology. We thus expect that our study will pave the way for fast and significant improvements of the clinical benefits offered to implanted patients."

We used charge balanced squared pulses (1 ms per phase) of varying current intensity and polarity displayed at 80 Hz during 1 s. Such pulses were either injected through single electrodes (SE, for MEAs with 9 and 17 electrodes) or through all active electrodes (wMEA, for MEAs with 9 electrodes only) in monopolar mode. The diameters of the MEA active surface are of 50 and 650 \u00b5m for SE and wMEA, respectively which correspond to 1 and 11\u00b0 according to Hughes\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Hughes, 1979</a>). Four different protocols were then used. In the first protocol, we tested the effect of increasing current intensity level [\u00b1 4 8 16 37.5 75 150 300 \u00b5A] (cathodic pulse first) for SE and wMEA. For the analysis, current levels \u2264 50 \u00b5A and \u226575 \u00b5A will be considered as low and high intensities, respectively. We next investigated the effect of stimulus intensity and polarity for SE only. Two current intensity levels (\u00b1 50 and \u00b1 200 \u00b5A) and both polarities (cathodic or anodic pulse first) were used. For SE, we also tested the effect of pulse asymmetry and polarity at \u00b1 200 \u00b5A. Instead of having symmetrical phase of 1\u00a0ms each, the asymmetrical pulses consisted of a first long phase of 1 ms at 40 \u00b5A followed by a short phase of 200 \u00b5s at 200 \u00b5A (asymmetrical ratio = 5). In total, 4 conditions were used in this protocol, 2 symmetrical and 2 asymmetrical pulses of opposite polarities. For the last protocol in SE, we switch from current to voltage injection mode to test the effect of Impedance Spectroscopy (IS) adapted stimuli as described below."

This procedure requires first measuring the impedance of the electrodes (magnitude and phase) for a wide range of frequencies (Impedance Spectroscopy). These measures unveil the capacitive nature of the electrode-tissue interface (<a href=\"#bib22\">Geddes, 1997</a>). Thus the actual current or voltage pattern injected in the tissue is strongly distorted and does not resemble the desired pattern (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, left column). A solution proposed by Dupont <i>et al.</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dupont et al., 2013</a>)\u00a0is therefore to estimate the equivalent electrical circuit that accounts for the observed spectrum and use it to reverse engineer what needed to be used to achieve the desired injected pattern (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, right column). To achieve this, the experimental design integrates an IS recording module, an Identification Algorithm module fitting IS data to an Electronic Equivalent Circuit (EEC), a Transfer Function Computing module and an Adapted Stimuli Shaping module computing adapted stimuli emitted by the Stimuli Generator module (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, patent CEA-LETI) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dupont et al., 2013</a>). In this study, the test bench is built with commercial devices. IS measurements are performed by injecting low AC voltage between 100 Hz and 200 kHz with a Bio-Logic potentiostat (SP240 type). Data are fitted to a chosen EEC (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, see legend for a detailed description of the different components of the circuit) (<a href=\"#bib40\">McAdams and Jossinet, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ragheb and Geddes, 1990</a>) using the potentiostat associated software (EC-Lab). A transfer function H linking V<sub>IMPLANT</sub> to V<sub>TISSUE</sub> is defined. To compute the adapted signal to be generated by the stimuli generator, we use the inverse transfer function H<sup>-1</sup> estimation. However, this transfer function does not take into account the impedance\u2019s non-linearity toward voltage levels. To address this issue, several IS measurements are performed between 1 mV<sub>pp</sub> and 4 V<sub>pp</sub> (V<sub>pp</sub>: Volts peak-to-peak). Each set of data is fitted onto the same EEC. The abacuses 'EEC parameters <i>versus</i> voltage' are then used to compute the adapted stimulus using voltage dedicated transfer functions per signal harmonics."

We dealt beforehand with pixel-wise trial to trial variability. The averaged time-course of the outer border (2 pixels width) of the image area (outside the region of interest) was subtracted from each pixel to remove non-functional temporal noise pattern. We then performed from each trial a first temporal normalization by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation both estimated from the frame 0. Second we averaged over trials and applied a spatial normalization. Static maps were computed by averaging 1.5 to 2.5 s after stimulus onset (initial dip). Spatial z-score normalization was based on the averaged static map of the blank condition. Pixel by pixel, we subtracted from each static map the mean value of the blank and divided the outcome by the blank standard deviation over space. Significance of cortical activation was achieved by applying a threshold of \u22123.09 Z-score (activation contour) which corresponds to p-value of 0.01 (lower activations were not considered for further analysis). These activation contours were computed on a smoothed version of the maps (convolving the raw matrix with a 15x15 pixel flat matrix). To give a comparison with most optical imaging publications, we also provided on each map a second colorbar scale expressed in DI/I which was computed using the standard procedure as follows (see <a href=\"#bib59\">Reynaud et al., 2011</a>): The first step consists of dividing each image of the stack by the mean of the first frames recorded before stimulus onset. In the second step, image stacks collected during stimulated trials are subtracted to those acquired during blank trials on a frame-by-frame basis."

For each cortical positions (i, j), we calculated the median value of the differences between the angles formed by the segments that connect each cortical activation center to the cortical position in question (i, j) (e.g. expected radial arrangement, dashed segments in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and the observed angle of the elongated cortical activation (solid segments in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). We then looked for the cortical position for which this difference was the smallest (i.e. the cortical position for which the observed orientation of the activations was the closest to the expected radial arrangement). This gave us the cortical position that optimized the radial arrangement for our specific configuration (black disk in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). We thereafter use this position rather than the median position of the optic disk (quite close, gray disk in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) because we believe it is more reliable for two reasons. First, since we positioned all cortical images within the same reference frame (aligned to the midline and to <i>bregma</i>), the cortical representation of the optic disk should be approximately located at similar location in the map. Second, the individual mapping of the optic disk would have added unnecessary noise because of its imprecision (and for some sessions we could not achieve a proper mapping). Indeed, to map the optic disk representation, we estimated its position on the screen using backward projections from an ophthalmoscope. Then we put it in correspondence to the visual stimulus of our retinotopic exploration (stimuli of 20x20\u00b0) it was falling within. The center of the cortical activation for this stimulus gave an estimation of where the optic disk should be represented cortically. This introduces a series of imprecision (estimation with the ophthalmoscope, backward projection, not centered with the visual stimulus, cortical activation) that would be detrimental to our computation."

The question is whether the difference between the predicted (optimal radial arrangement) and the observed angles of activation is smaller than the one expected by chance. For that purpose, we generated 1000 random distributions of orientations of cortical activation at the observed positions. For each of these random distributions, we looked for the cortical position that optimized radial arrangement with the method described above. For each specific distribution that was randomly generated, we thus obtained a value of the minimum angular deviation between the predicted and the observed orientations. We obtained likewise a distribution of the angular deviation expected by chance (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> inset), over which we used the area under the curve of our observation to estimate the p-value: p*=0.021 (note that the distribution was also very well captured by a Gaussian fit from which we can calculate the probability of finding the observed angular deviation, and obtained a comparable z-score of 2.09, p=0.018)."

Roux et al. have developed an in vivo rodent preparation in order to compare visual and prosthetic activation of downstream visual areas, specifically visual cortex. They find that the cortical projective field, i.e., the cortical area activated by stimulation of single or multiple electrodes, is larger than the projective field of visual stimuli covering a similar extent of the retina. The authors then attempted to identify potential causes of and solutions to this problem, focusing primarily on spread of the electrical pulse through tissue and en passant activation of RGC axons coursing to the optic nerve. They find that by measuring the impedance of the tissue-electrode interface and correcting for this effect, they can somewhat reduce the lateral spread of excitation in cortex. This use of adaptation, particularly in tandem with other published techniques, may aid in enhancing the acuity of retinal prostheses."

As we stated in the Discussion of previous version, we believe that Impedance Spectroscopy adaptation is acting \u201cboth [on] the electrical diffusion extent (although not completely) and the axons en passant activation\u201d. Hence, this can explain how it decreases both the spread of activation (e.g. cone angle) and the AR by acting on these two mechanisms. We now further describe in the text what could be the reason for a decrease in the spread of activation. The evidence is coming from spectral analysis of the pulses: Adapted pulses have energy exclusively concentrated below 800Hz, whereas non-adapted pulses have energy ringing up to 4KHz (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We have shown in Pham et al. (Pham et al., 2013), for good implantations) that high frequencies increase both the spread of the electrical diffusion and the current density magnitude (Figure 9A-B-C in Pham et al. 2013)."

It is now well documented that axons have shorter <i>chronaxie</i>, generally some hundreds of microsecond, than cell bodies, generally several milliseconds (Histed et al., 2009; McIntyre and Grill, 2002; Nowak and Bullier, 1998a; 1998b; Ranck, 1975; Stern et al., 2015; Tehovnik and Slocum, 2009). If we look at the shape of the current injected in the tissue using regular non-adapted pulses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> left row), we see that the duration of each cathodic or anodic pulse lasts about 0.23ms (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, width at half-height), hence favoring activation of axons. Our result (e.g. a ratio of en passantrecruitment of about the same contribution as direct activation) is thus not surprising. In contrast, in the adaptation condition, the duration of each (cathodic or anodic) pulse inside the tissue was much longer (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, 1.2ms), biphasic, cathodic phase first and asymmetrical in amplitude. According to the work of Mc Intyre (McIntyre and Grill, 2002), these are the conditions for which an increase in the threshold for activation of axons and a decrease for the soma are expected (see citation below*). Furthermore, since the amplitude of the current injected in the tissue was low compare to the reference condition, it is thus expected that the adapted condition will comparatively lower the contribution of fiber-en-passant."

(Vaiceliunaite et al., 2013) on mouse with isoflurane/urethane anesthesia. These authors describe in V1 neurons less surround inhibition, in other words, neurons have a maximal response for smaller stimuli when awaked than when anesthetized. This could imply that cortical activation will be larger in anesthetized condition than in the awake. However, in their paper, we can see that the overall response amplitude for large stimulus in the awake condition is still significant (see their Figure 3G &amp; J, Vaiceliunaite et al., 2013). So, if we try to deduce from these single neuron activities the extent of cortical neuronal population significantly activated, it is not clear that the size will change, however, probably, the shape will (more peaky when awaked). This is reinforced by the evidence, in the rat, that both excitation and inhibition are affected by anesthesia (Vizuete et al., 2012) suggesting that surround suppression decrease could be accompanied by a drop in excitatory level as well. In a recent model, we investigated how the population network response is affected by anesthesia (Chemla and Chavane, 2016), and we confronted our prediction to experimental measure. Our conclusion was that the whole excitatory/inhibitory balance was indeed disrupted. When taken globally, this suggests that it is straightforward to make a simple prediction of how anesthesia will change the activation extent. A direct measure is warranted. We actually did a series of experiments on the monkey using optical imaging (Chemla and Chavane, 2016), comparing the response dynamic in awake vs. anesthetized conditions (where we confirm the general decrease in response amplitude documented in the mouse and rat in the two previous articles). From one of these experiments, not used in the article, we presented a local stimulus (1\u00b0 in diameter, optimized in spatial and temporal frequency) in the same monkey while he was awake, and when he was anesthetized using midazolam (potentiates GABAA, see <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 2</a>). In this experiment, we show that the population response is actually smaller in the anesthetized condition (reduction of 14% of the equivalent diameter of the ellipse formed by the contour taken at 75% of the response maximum, hence lowers absolute threshold for the anesthetized condition). As a conclusion, it is not trivial to predict how the cortical spatial profile of activation will be affected by anesthesia. However, this was an important point to clarify."

This is what is expected in first simple assumption: a large activation in the optical imaging map will generate a large retinotopic spiking region that can be decoded as high probability of a large stimulus being present in the outside world. In a recent study, the group of E. Seidemann actually showed, using optical imaging, that the shape of the cortical activation in V1 bias accordingly the shape of the evoked percept (Michel et al., 2013), suggesting that there is a link between the spatial profile of the activation and the percept. Further evidence comes from the publications from Tehovnik and Shiller group using cortical stimulation. Schiller et al. (Schiller et al., 2011) indeed show that by increasing stimulation intensity of the cortex, there is a tendency for monkeys to perceive the stimulus size larger. This should be taken in consideration with the result of a previous publication, where Tolias et al. (Tolias et al., 2005) have shown that increasing the stimulus intensity increases the size of the cortical activation. These are two evidences that the spatial profile of cortical activation in V1 is most probably linked to the size of the percept. We now add this in the Discussion (second paragraph), arguing in favor of pursuing these studies in awake animals, using behavioral tasks, in order to further demonstrate this important link."

However, please note that the z-score measure was devised to ensure proper comparison of maps across conditions (see Jancke et al., 2004). The importance of this calculation is grounded because of experimental noise and variation across experiments, the baseline and the amplitude of the DI/I are highly variable compare to the z-score values (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and H</a> and even more in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and C</a>).

In our simulation, this inversion is observed around 40\u00b0, a value for which the tangent of the cone angle (i.e. tangential activation) becomes larger than the cosine (radial activation).
