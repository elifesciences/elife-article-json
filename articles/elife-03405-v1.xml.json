Using <i>in vivo</i> two-photon calcium imaging in the rat barrel cortex during artificial whisking against different surface coarseness or controlled passive whisker vibrations simulating different coarseness, we show that layer 2\u20133 neurons within barrel boundaries differentially respond to specific texture coarsenesses, while only a minority of neurons responded monotonically with increased or decreased surface coarseness. Neurons with similar preferred texture coarseness were spatially clustered. Multi-contact single unit recordings showed a vertical columnar organization of texture coarseness preference in layer 2\u20133. These findings indicate that layer 2\u20133 neurons perform high hierarchical processing of tactile information, with surface coarseness embodied by distinct neuronal subpopulations that are spatially mapped onto the barrel cortex."

Using <i>in vivo</i> two-photon calcium imaging in the rat barrel cortex during artificial whisking against different surface coarseness or controlled passive whisker vibrations simulating different coarseness, we show that layer 2\u20133 neurons within barrel boundaries differentially respond to specific texture coarsenesses, while only a minority of neurons responded monotonically with increased or decreased surface coarseness. Neurons with similar preferred texture coarseness were spatially clustered. Multi-contact single unit recordings showed a vertical columnar organization of texture coarseness preference in layer 2\u20133. These findings indicate that layer 2\u20133 neurons perform high hierarchical processing of tactile information, with surface coarseness embodied by distinct neuronal subpopulations that are spatially mapped onto the barrel cortex."

By recording nerve impulses from the barrel cortex of anesthetized rats as the animals' whiskers were moved back and forth across four sandpapers of differing coarseness, Garion et al. have obtained key insights into how this process works. Only a small minority of barrel cortex neurons were more active or less active in response to an increase or a decrease in coarseness. Instead, most neurons showed a preference for one particular coarseness and fired much more when the rats' whiskers encountered the corresponding sandpaper."

Using their whiskers, rodents can locate and distinguish objects in their immediate sensory environment (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carvell and Simons, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">von Heimendahl et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Diamond et al., 2008b</a>). Texture discrimination is one of the major sensory tasks performed by the barrel whisker system, and just a few whisker palpations are sufficient for discriminating between different texture coarseness with a high degree of sensitivity and reliability (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guic-Robles et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carvell and Simons, 1990</a>).

This spatio-functional representation is one of the fundamental principles governing organization of different sensory cortexes. For example, in the visual system, neurons that selectively respond to certain bar orientations or movement directions in the visual field are organized in columns (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ohki et al., 2005</a>). In the somatosensory whisker system the most conspicuous functional spatial map is the somatotopical organization of the vibrissae array onto the S1 cortex (<a href=\"#bib51\">Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Andermann and Moore, 2006</a>). Information about the organization within the barrel column is lacking. It has been shown that neurons in the barrel cortex selectively respond to certain angular directions of whisker deflection (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bruno et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Andermann and Moore, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lavzin et al., 2012</a>), which tend to be arranged in maps (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Andermann and Moore, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lottem and Azouz, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kremer et al., 2011</a>).

Sandpapers are traditionally used as a substrate of choice to investigate coarseness (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guic-Robles et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Diamond et al., 2008b</a>) as different sandpapers mainly differ by the average size of their particles (grit size), which are uniformly distributed across a flat surface. In experiments that included FW only three sandpapers were examined (P320, P600, and P1000) due to time limitation imposed by the dye washout observed in the AM bulk loading technique (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sato et al., 2007</a>). To increase the temporal resolution during acquisition of calcium signals from large number of neurons, we developed a new free hand line scan routine that allowed us to retain high temporal resolution (50\u2013100 Hz) while simultaneously recording from dozens of neurons (50.3 \u00b1 3.4 neurons per experiment, range of 24\u201389 neurons per experiment, 23 rats) (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The stability of the line scan path was checked continuously during the experiment (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>). Responses were recorded from the principle barrel, as determined by intrinsic imaging during whisker deflection (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and whisker displacements were measured by an infrared photo-sensor and a high speed camera (Flare, IO industries at 1000 fps) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Our imaging measurements showed that the calcium transients were locked to the whisking envelopes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, the temporal resolution of our calcium measurements (up to 100 Hz) was not sufficient to detect changes resulting from individual micro movements of the whisker. To characterize the variability and reliability of the calcium and whisking responses between repeated trails, we calculated the mean and SEM of the responses in individual neurons (individual traces are shown for four neurons in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and the average values are shown for all neurons in a single experiment in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Furthermore, we tracked whisker movements during artificial whisking using the fast camera (1000 Hz) (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). We found little variability in the whisker angle between consecutive trails and between different trial blocks (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>), indicating robust whisker movements during artificial whisking. As expected, we did observe differences in the whisker curvature (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>) and differences in the stick and slip events between different texture coarseness (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

Nerve stimulation was performed with a silver hook attached electrode to the buccal nerve. Only the principle whisker was left intact while other whiskers were trimmed. Artificial whisking (10 trains at 5.5 Hz) was performed either in free air (FW) or against different sandpapers. The calcium indicator Fluo-4 AM and the astrocytic dye SR101 were injected to layer 2\u20133 via a glass pipette under visual control using the two-photon microscope. The right upper panel shows an image of all cells filled with Fluo-4 and the right lower panel shows the astrocytes filled with SR101 in the same field of view (260 \u00b5m from pia). Left lower panel, calcium dependent fluorescent signals were collected from cells (horizontal aspect) using the free hand line scan mode (cyan line in right upper panel) and presented as a function of time (vertical aspect). Red lines mark the stimulus time. (<b>B</b>) Simultaneous recordings of the fluorescent calcium signal (red) and whisker trajectory (gray and blue) recorded using an optic sensor. The blue trace shows the unfiltered optical signal, and the gray trace shows the same optical data filtered (band pass of 50\u2013500 Hz). 10% scale bar denotes the <i>\u0394F/F</i> calcium transient signal. (<b>C</b>) Simultaneous voltage recording (gray) and calcium imaging (red) from a single neuron. The cell was bulk loaded with Fluo-4 and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the cell-attached recording mode from visually targeted neurons. Action potentials were partially truncated in the electrophysiological traces. (<b>D</b>) Example of the averaged calcium transient (red) and the corresponding single traces (14 repetitions, gray) from 4 single cells are presented together with the whisker stimulation (blue, 10 whisking cycles at 5.5 Hz). The traces in the different neurons were obtained simultaneously in the free hand line-scan imaging mode. (<b>E</b>) Average peak amplitude (\u00b1SEM) (red) and area (gray) of the calcium transients evoked by artificial whisking for all the cells (n = 51) recorded in one experiment."

First, in all experiments, we identified the vertical blood vessels at the TPLSM plane and histological images, and vertically reconstructed down to the layer 4 barrel which was identified by cytochrome oxidase staining. Second, in some experiments (n = 7), we validated our conclusions by performing biocytin electroporation of selected bulk loaded neurons and later performed post hoc histology of cytochrome oxidase barrel staining aligned to the neuronal biocytin staining (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For these experiments at the end of the imaging session several bulk loaded neurons were electroporated with biocytin using a patch electrode (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The biocytin-labeled neurons served as second clear anatomical landmark for alignment with the barrel boundaries (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In principle, the calcium responses could be presented either as the average <i>\u0394F/F</i> or as peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTH) of spikes after transforming the calcium responses of individual traces to spike trains. We chose to present the data as averaged <i>\u0394F/F</i> rather than spike trains for two main reasons: first, while our algorithm of transforming individual calcium responses to spike trains robustly detected firing events, determining the exact number of action potentials in each event was less reliable especially when firing is more intense as in our case. Second, reliable spike train transformation can only be performed in \u223c50% (56.4 \u00b1 3.5%) of our recorded neurons in accordance with previous studies thus reducing the number of simultaneously analyzed cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kerr et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sato et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rothschild et al., 2010</a>) (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

Instead, many neurons responded preferentially to one of the four textures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). To quantify the response to different textures, we calculated the selectivity index (SI) for each neuron (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a> for examples; for definition of SI see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We further defined neurons with S.I. \u2265 0.35 as texture coarseness preferring neurons (for more details see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The SI calculations were performed independently using both the peak and area of the averaged calcium transients, and in 90.6 \u00b1 3.2% of neurons, the preferred texture determined by the peak amplitudes and response areas corresponded."

Aside from rare exceptions, neurons residing outside the barrel boundaries were either non-responsive or showed low selectivity (S.I. &lt; 0.35) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The average calcium transients of responsive cells in the septa regions was approximately 10% smaller than that recorded within barrel boundaries (3.7 \u00b1 0.3% compared to 4.0 \u00b1 0.2%, p &lt; 0.01). Thus, it is unlikely that the lack of coarseness preferring neurons in the septa regions resulted solely from the small amplitude of the responses in the septa. On average 54.4 \u00b1 3.5% of all recorded neurons within the barrel boundaries showed either texture coarseness or FW preference (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>).

The percent of non-responsive neurons was lower in the electrophysiological recordings (2 \u00b1 1.3%) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), probably due to the larger number of repetitions in the electrophysiological experiments.

We find texture responding neurons in layer 2\u20133 barrel cortex with subset of neurons preferentially responding to different texture coarseness. We further find that cells with similar preferred texture coarseness are spatially clustered across layer 2\u20133 of the barrel cortex. It is presently unclear whether these neurons code for the complex entity of coarseness or alternatively code for another more basic physical feature such as velocity of the whisker, grain sharpness, grain size, frequency etc. Regardless of the answer to this important question it is clear that texture coarseness can be decoded from the activity of these neurons irrespective of the exact physical entity they code for. These findings were shown in two different whisker activation paradigms, artificial whisking against different texture coarseness and passive replay of texture-like vibrations. The manner by which whiskers are activated is critical for the experiments. There is no \u2018perfect\u2019 way to repeatedly activate the whisker system in a robust and behaviorally relevant manner. Behaving rats performing texture discrimination tasks are of course most physiologically relevant, yet multiple well-controlled robust repetitions are very hard to obtain. On the other side of the spectrum passive whisker movements in anesthetized rodents are very well controlled and robust; yet probably differ from the physiological whisker activation. Artificial whisking in anesthetized animals is an intermediate whisker activation paradigm however receptor activation may deviate from that occurring under physiological whisking. It is important to note that a recent report shows that the kinematics of the whisker movement during artificial whisking closely simulates that of freely behaving rats (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bagdasarian et al., 2013</a>). In our experiments both passive whisker activation and artificial whisking yielded similar results, reinforcing our main conclusion that texture selective neurons clustered across the S1 barrel cortex. It is however important to stress that in our experiments, rats were anesthetized; and in future, the findings should be corroborated in behaving animals. It is interesting to note that texture responding neurons were detected in barrel cortex of awake behaving mice during a texture discrimination paradigm (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2013</a>)."

Psychophysical tests show that using their macro vibrissae, rats can discriminate between grain sizes as small as 10\u201320 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#bib35\">Morita et al., 2011</a>). The underlying cortical coding mechanisms responsible for the formidable capability of rodents to distinguish texture coarseness have been studied extensively, mainly in granular and infra-granular cortical layers using multi- and single-unit recordings (<a href=\"#bib20\">Guic-Robles et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arabzadeh et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">von Heimendahl et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Diamond et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Morita et al., 2011</a>). In the granular and infra-granular cortical layers of the barrel cortex neurons mostly respond to stick and slip events, and surface coarseness has been shown to be coded for the most part by the average spike count in the neuronal population. However, a rate coding spike count scheme could only explain discrimination between rough vs smooth textures (<a href=\"#bib49\">von Heimendahl et al., 2007</a>), but could not explain discrimination between finer textures well within the psychophysical discrimination curve of the rat (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arabzadeh et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Diamond et al., 2008a</a>). Thus, additional coding schemes based on the timing of action potential firing or on sparse synchronous firing have been suggested (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arabzadeh et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Diamond et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jadhav et al., 2009</a>). In addition to the \u2018temporally based coding schemes\u2019, a \u2018resonance\u2019 coding theory has also been suggested. The resonance hypothesis suggests that texture identity is represented spatially across the whisker pad. This representation stems from the gradient of whiskers' lengths across the pad, denoting each whisker with a distinct resonance frequency (<a href=\"#bib36\">Neimark et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andermann et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sato et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Diamond et al., 2008a</a>)."

According to our results, coarseness is coded by neurons which prefer different coarsenesses, including the intermediate texture coarseness P600. We corroborated the existence of these neurons using electrophysiological single unit recordings. Interestingly, we found that neurons with similar coarseness preference are spatially clustered. Though certainly differences in coarseness induce differences in multiple parameters in whisker kinematics, the spatial clustering by itself may hint that coarseness is a fundamental quality that is represented in the rodent cortex. A coding scheme based on coarseness selective neurons can increase the reliability of texture coarseness coding as coarseness can be extracted by comparing the activity of neurons with different coarseness tuning. The alternative coding scheme where coarseness is extracted from the average firing of the neuronal population maybe more sensitive to the activity state of the animal and the context of the stimulus. This coding scheme is highly reminiscent of the coding suggested in primary visual and auditory cortexes in which subsets of neurons respond with increased firing selectively to a specific feature of the physical stimulus such as orientation or tone frequency (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Nelken et al., 2004</a>)."

The downside of such an approach is that it does not address the question of what features are extracted by neurons during different coarseness representation. Keeping in mind that in sensory research one can only find tuning within the parameter space examined, designing the appropriate parameter space of stimuli that will encompass in unbiased way what features are extracted by neurons is a highly complicated issue and awaits further investigation. It is important to stress that this problem is generic to all sensory systems. Just as in the visual system, for example, both simple, artificial stimuli (e.g., drifting gratings), and more naturalistic stimuli (e.g., natural image patches) revealed complementary aspects of sensory coding (<a href=\"#bib16\">Felsen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gollisch and Meister, 2008</a>), also in the somatosensory system both simple passive and more complex natural stimuli are needed to reveal the full coding scheme of the system."

Previous anatomical and functional studies have shown that barrel and septa neurons belong to different sub-networks associated with different thalamocortical and intra-cortical circuits (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brecht and Sakmann, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bureau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kerr et al., 2007</a>).

This enabled us to define a line that passed through large numbers of neurons with relatively high temporal resolution (acquisition rate of 50\u2013100 Hz). To assure the stability of the line scan a reference image was captured every 3\u20135 scans and if needed corrections were made (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Methods that allow for scanning along a user defined path were described in the past for a two-dimensional plane (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lillis et al., 2008</a>) and for three-dimensional volume (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gobel et al., 2007</a>). To obtain a free hand line scan routine, we created a scan path on a reference image which is built of a list of scanned pixel locations on that image. Later, we constructed a matrix of voltage values where Vx(i) and Vy(j) are the voltages that are needed by the X\u2013Y galvanometer to drive the scanning beam to the ith and jth positions. Using this matrix, we can back-map the voltage values from a reference location on a scanned area."

The nerve was cut, and its distal end mounted on a bipolar tungsten electrodes. Bipolar, rectangular electrical pulses (0.5\u20134.0 V, 40 \u00b5s duration) were applied through an isolated pulse stimulator (A360, WPI) at 100 Hz to produce whisker protraction, followed by a passive whisker retraction. The stimulation magnitude was adjusted to the minimal value that reliably generated the maximal possible movement amplitude. Typically, we evoked 10 consecutive trains (5.5 Hz, 50% duty cycle, 2 s) with 30 s between runs. All other whiskers except the principle whisker were cut off, the principle whisker was presented with different sandpapers (2 cm<sup>2</sup>) with the tip of the vibrissa just touching the sand paper. The textures were manually placed to be coplanar with the trajectory of the whisker motion, and the distance from the whisker pad was set such that the whisker contacted the texture and made a full move on the texture without being stuck."

The cylinder (30 mm diameter) was driven by a DC motor (Farnell, Leeds, UK). We employed surfaces of four different grades (the numbers in the parentheses indicate the average grain diameter): P100 (162 \u00b5m), P320 (46 \u00b5m), P600 (26 \u00b5m), P1000 (18 \u00b5m). The cylinder surface was oriented so that the whisker rested on it and remained in contact during the entire session. For each texture, we recorded 50 revolutions (trials) per texture of the rotating cylinder, each lasting approximately 1 s. Whisker displacements transmitted to the receptors in the follicle were measured by an infrared photo-sensor (resolution: 1 \u00b5m; Panasonic: CNZ1120) placed 2 mm from the pad. The voltage signals were digitized at 10 KHz and amplified. The principle whisker was stimulated using a galvanometer (Model 6210H; Cambridge instruments). The voltages were delivered to evoke movements with amplitudes 15\u201330 \u00b5m (calibration of the galvanometer movement was performed using optical displacement measuring system resolution, \u00b5m; LD1605-2; Micro-Epsilon) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lottem and Azouz, 2009</a>). The whisker movements during passive whisker stimulation were characterized by their power spectrum (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lottem and Azouz, 2009</a>). In order to measure spectral characteristics of this signal, we applied short time Fourier transform using pwelch in Matlab. Let <i>S</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>(<i>f</i><sub><i>m</i></sub>) be Power Spectral Density (PSD) at frequency <i>f</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> for texture <i>k</i>.

Large radial vessels could be identified within these stacks. Then the neurons that were imaged with Fluo-4 were labeled with 5% biocytin using targeted electroporation via a glass pipette (10 V, square-wave pulses of 200 ms duration at 2 Hz for 5.5 s; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pinault, 1996</a>). Thirty minutes later the animals were perfused with 0.1 PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed and stored at the fixative for at least 24 hr. After fixation tangential slices (100 \u00b5m thick) were cut. Slices from cortical layer 4 (400\u2013900 \u00b5m) were processed with the Cytochrome oxidase staining to reveal the barrel pattern. Slices from cortical layers 2\u20133 (0\u2013400 \u00b5m) were processed with the 3,3-diaminobezidine (DAB) using avidin-biotin-peroxidase method for staining neurons filled with biocytin (<a href=\"#bib23\">Horikawa and Armstrong, 1988</a>). All processed slices were mounted on slides embedded in Immu-mount. Imaging of the stained sections was conducted using a confocal microscope (Olympus FV 1000). Control of the microscope was done using Flouview10-ASW 2.1 software. The biocytin and Fluo-4 images were superimposed one upon the other with the neurons mutually stained in both images as anatomical landmarks. The relationship between the neurons (found in layers 2\u20133) and the barrels (stained in layer 4) was determined by the blood vasculature ascending through the cortex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

This is an essential quantification if they want to answer Reviewer 1's comment since the barrel maps themselves don't look that convincing. Also, in this section of the text they state that \u201cthe normalized map raises the possibility that textures coarseness is arranged along a diagonal axis\u201d. However, if this was the case, one would expect there to be roughly equal numbers of very coarse neurons at the barrel edge as very fine neurons, with intermediate neurons clustered in the centre. This is inconsistent with the variation in coarseness preference with radial distance that they report in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>. In fact, perhaps this diagonal mapping of texture is what causes the relationship between coarseness and radial distance in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> to be so weak since in order to calculate this they simply group the two coarsest textures into one \u201ccoarse\u201d group and the two finest into one \u201cfine group\u201d. In order to reconcile the conclusion of <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> with that of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> they should simply plot a scatter plot between coarseness and radial distance for both conditions. The shape of this relationship will show whether arrangement is concentric or diagonal within a barrel."

It would enhance the paper greatly to demonstrate whether the passively evoked responses also show functional maps when superimposed on a barrel as in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>; more specifically: are passively stimulated coarse-selective neurons also located near the edges of the barrels?"

With this method we were able to target the barrel, but not the septa.

We did not use electrical lesions as we reused our recording electrodes, and did not want to damage them by the current injection. In our opinion these methods were sufficiently reliable to determine that the electrodes were placed within the barrel boundaries (if close to the barrel center), but due to the small size of the septa relative to the barrels, these methods were not accurate enough to distinguish between septal and barrel perimeter locations."

In this project we decided to treat texture coarseness as a single wholesome quality due to its biophysical importance. However, we are well aware of the fact that texture coarseness is composed of individual physical properties, and in turn one or more of these properties might be mapped onto the barrel. Previous studies have shown that whisker deflection direction is mapped onto the barrel. Although this is an interesting possibility at this point it is hard for us to see how textures differ from each other by the whisker deflection direction they evoke. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the texture mapping would be a composite of other maps such as direction and other qualities that are not yet known to be mapped.
