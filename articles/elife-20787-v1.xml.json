To explore how temporal dynamics and directional tuning are sculpted in hierarchical vestibular circuits, we compared responses of macaque otolith afferents with neurons in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei, as well as five cortical areas, to identical three-dimensional translational motion. We demonstrate a remarkable spatio-temporal transformation: otolith afferents carry spatially aligned cosine-tuned translational acceleration and jerk signals. In contrast, brainstem and cerebellar neurons exhibit non-linear, mixed selectivity for translational velocity, acceleration, jerk and position. Furthermore, these components often show dissimilar spatial tuning. Moderate further transformation of translation signals occurs in the cortex, such that similar spatio-temporal properties are found in multiple cortical areas. These results suggest that the first synapse represents a key processing element in vestibular pathways, robustly shaping how self-motion is represented in central vestibular circuits and cortical areas."

To explore how temporal dynamics and directional tuning are sculpted in hierarchical vestibular circuits, we compared responses of macaque otolith afferents with neurons in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei, as well as five cortical areas, to identical three-dimensional translational motion. We demonstrate a remarkable spatio-temporal transformation: otolith afferents carry spatially aligned cosine-tuned translational acceleration and jerk signals. In contrast, brainstem and cerebellar neurons exhibit non-linear, mixed selectivity for translational velocity, acceleration, jerk and position. Furthermore, these components often show dissimilar spatial tuning. Moderate further transformation of translation signals occurs in the cortex, such that similar spatio-temporal properties are found in multiple cortical areas. These results suggest that the first synapse represents a key processing element in vestibular pathways, robustly shaping how self-motion is represented in central vestibular circuits and cortical areas."

Such systematic analyses provide a foundation for comprehending the neural computations that convert early sensory activity into higher level constructs that underlie perception, action, and other cognitive functions. For the vestibular system, however, such analysis has been largely limited to reflex generation in the brainstem and cerebellum. On the other hand, there are multiple cortical areas that respond to vestibular stimuli, typically together with other sensory and motor signals (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gr\u00fcsser et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Bremmer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Fukushima et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Klam and Graf, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Chen et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2011b</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2011c</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Gu et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2016</a>).

This pattern represents the most frequently encountered type of central neuron. Also note that the separability index was high, despite the strongly non-cosine tuning of velocity and jerk. This is because the spatial tuning of velocity and jerk is often very broad, and the separability index is a measure of the tuning similarity of the different temporal components. Thus, a separability index close to one does not necessarily imply cosine (afferent-like) spatial tuning."

The percentage of neurons that were best fit by each of the 7 (V, A, J, VA, VJ, AJ and VAJ) models is shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. Remarkably, there was a sharp contrast between OAs and central cells. Forty-eight\u00a0percent of OAs were best fit by the A model and 33% by the AJ model, whereas only 19% were best fit by the VAJ model. This indicates that acceleration responses are ubiquitous in OAs, whereas half of them respond to jerk and only a few to velocity. In contrast, 6% of central cells were best fit by the V model, 20% and 10% by the VA and VJ model, and 60% by the VAJ model, indicating that velocity responses were very common in central neurons. For comparison with previous work (<a href=\"#bib23\">Chen et al., 2011c</a>), we also tested a more complex model in which the non-linear function assumed the form of an exponential. We found that this model performed only marginally better (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); thus, we did not consider it further in this study."

However, the performance improvement was modest, as indicated by the ratio R<sup>2</sup><sub>affine</sub> / R<sup>2</sup><sub>exponential</sub>. This ratio was close to one for the majority of neurons; its median value was 0.97, and it was greater than 0.9 for 91% of the cells.

This indicates that these cells were poorly fit (with typically low and noisy responses), such that the extended model was prone to overfitting. We conclude that the extended model provides little quantitative benefit compared to its increased complexity; thus, we adopted the simpler affine model in this study."

Thus, the two temporal components that dominated otolith afferent responses were spatially aligned, which is consistent with separable spatio-temporal tuning. Although velocity weights were overall small, the preferred direction of the velocity component relative to acceleration or jerk components (V-A or V-J) showed a significant dependence on CV* (both r\u00a0=\u00a00.7, p&lt;0.01, Spearman's rank correlation; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

Accordingly, they cluster between the A and J corners. The ternary plots of VN and CN neurons (yellow and orange, respectively) show a strikingly different pattern. Qualitatively, it is readily apparent that VN/CN cells carry substantially less acceleration signals, and much more velocity signals than otolith afferents. Quantitatively (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), the normalized acceleration weight (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), which is high for otolith afferents, becomes significantly smaller for VN and CN neurons (p&lt;10<sup>\u22128</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test). In parallel, the velocity weights (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) are significantly greater for VN and CN neurons, as compared to otolith afferents (p&lt;10<sup>\u221214</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test). There is little difference between jerk weights (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) of VN/CN neurons and otolith afferents (p=0.03, Wilcoxon\u2019s rank sum test). Remarkably, despite dramatic differences in the relative weighting of acceleration and velocity signals between central cells and otolith afferents, VN and CN have similar properties overall, and there is no significant difference between weight values for the two areas (Wilcoxon\u2019s rank sum test, <math id=\"inf52\"><mrow><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>v</mi></msub></mrow></math>: p=0.75; <math id=\"inf53\"><mrow><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>a</mi></msub></mrow></math>; p=0.47; <math id=\"inf54\"><mrow><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow></math>: p=0.28)."

Thus, small gain modulation and high baseline firing rates in primary otolith afferents are converted into high gain modulation and low baseline firing rates in central brainstem, cerebellar and cortical neurons. Note, however, that this baseline firing rate could include a steady-state response to gravity (since animals were always oriented upright), which is unequivocal in otolith afferents but reduced across the population in brainstem, cerebellar and cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Angelaki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Liu and Angelaki, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Shaikh et al., 2005</a>).

Our analysis has revealed remarkably different spatio-temporal properties between central neurons and primary otolith afferents. Whereas otolith afferents encode mostly linear acceleration, central neuron responses are dominated by components related to stimulus velocity. Furthermore, central neurons also encode jerk (the derivative of linear acceleration), as well as position (displacement). However, this position response component needs to be further investigated in future studies using stimuli that allow a precise quantification of the pre-stimulus and post-stimulus firing rates (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods)."

Thus, central neurons, like afferents, continued to carry information about the direction of linear acceleration, but they also encoded another type of signal: the presence or absence of translational motion without regard for direction. This component, which was strong in both the cortex and vestibular/cerebellar nuclei, cannot be characterized with the steady-state sinusoidal stimuli that have traditionally been the stimuli of choice in the vestibular system."

However, there were systematic differences in both the baseline firing and amplitude of stimulus-driven responses. Otolith afferents and vestibular/cerebellar nuclei neurons had high baseline firing compared to cortical neurons. Furthermore, response amplitude to an identical stimulus was lowest in otolith afferents and greatest in vestibular/cerebellar nuclei, PIVC and VPS \u2013 the areas known to form the core of the central vestibular system (<a href=\"#bib13\">Angelaki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lopez and Blanke, 2011</a>). In contrast, response amplitude is lower in MSTd, VIP and FEF, which are visual/vestibular multisensory areas. This result is consistent with <a href=\"#bib23\">Chen et al. (2011c)</a>, who speculated that the vestibular pathway might go from OA to VN/CN to PIVC to VIP to MSTd. However, although modulation strength remains high in VN/CN and PIVC, it is nevertheless reduced in multisensory visual areas MSTd, VIP and FEF. Note that, although otolith afferents have low peak-to-trough modulation, their information content is high because of the high firing rate regularity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Jamali et al., 2013</a>)."

The present findings are consistent with both conclusions. However, when the full 3D properties are considered in the present analyses, we find that the spatio-temporal tuning properties of individual cortical areas also exhibit remarkable similarities. Note also that the model of <a href=\"#bib23\">Chen et al. (2011c)</a> did not include a jerk component, which may also contribute to the results. Purkinje cells in the cerebellar vermal lobules X and IX, which were also previously fitted using the planar model (<a href=\"#bib72\">Yakusheva et al., 2013</a>), also showed similar properties to central brain areas when analyzed using the full 3D model used here (unpublished). In summary, these results suggest that the signal transformation that takes place between sensory afferents and their targets in the brainstem and cerebellum represents a key processing element in the vestibular system. Using identical passive stimuli, cortical areas show moderate differences, as compared to the response properties in the\u00a0brainstem and cerebellum."

This property of cortical neurons is likely inherited from subcortical signals, as there is growing evidence that this computation is implemented through otolith/canal convergence in the brainstem and cerebellum (VN/CN: <a href=\"#bib11\">Angelaki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; caudal cerebellar vermis: <a href=\"#bib71\">Yakusheva et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Laurens et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2013b</a>).

However, to our knowledge, all previously published studies of responses of VN/CN neurons to translation used sinusoidal stimuli. There are many reasons why such stimuli are problematic. First, VN and CN responses are characterized by non-minimum phase properties, i.e., phase and gain changes do not parallel each other, thus complicating identification of temporal dynamics using sinusoids (<a href=\"#bib10\">Angelaki and Dickman, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Dickman and Angelaki, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Shaikh et al., 2005</a>). Second, responses proportional to the temporal derivative and integral of translational acceleration cannot be easily separated using sinusoidal stimuli (e.g., a phase difference of 90\u00b0 relative to acceleration could reflect either velocity coding in one direction or jerk coding in the opposite direction). The traditional approach of testing sinusoidal responses at different frequencies to distinguish velocity from jerk contributions using linear systems analyses is complicated by the presence of non-minimum phase properties, thus making system identification challenging (<a href=\"#bib10\">Angelaki and Dickman, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Dickman and Angelaki, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Shaikh et al., 2005</a>). Furthermore, if indeed response dynamics vary with stimulus direction, a complete characterization of the spatio-temporal properties requires testing cells at multiple frequencies and multiple directions in 3D (<a href=\"#bib24\">Chen-Huang and Peterson, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2010</a>). Third, non-linearities in spatio-temporal tuning, as reported here (see also <a href=\"#bib23\">Chen et al., 2011c</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Massot et al., 2012</a>) can violate the assumptions of traditional linear systems analysis, thus rendering previous conclusions based on steady-state frequency analysis problematic."

It has been proposed that mixed selectivity plays an important computational role: high-dimensional representations with mixed selectivity allow a simple linear readout to generate a diverse array of potential responses (<a href=\"#bib32\">Fusi et al., 2016</a>). In contrast, representations based on highly specialized neurons are low dimensional and may preclude a linear readout from generating several responses that depend on multiple task-relevant variables. Complex non-linear operations can be performed by simple linear summations of non-linear neurons, and in turn linear summation may be easily learned by neuronal networks. Thus, a rich variety of non-linearly transformed signals may facilitate the learning of complex computations."

Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) were constructed for each direction of translation using 25 ms time bins and were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a0100 ms). We applied both temporal response modulation and space-time structure criteria to determine if a cell had responses strong enough to be included in the present analyses (see <a href=\"#bib21\">Chen et al. (2011a)</a> for details). For the temporal response criterion, we first found the peak (trough) time of the PSTH for each stimulus direction. Using the peak (trough) time, we obtained a distribution of response values from the PSTHs for each trial at that point in time. We then compared this peak (trough) distribution with the distribution of values obtained from baseline firing using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. If responses to two neighboring stimulus directions (45\u00b0 apart) had significantly (p&lt;0.01) different peak (trough) distributions compared to their own baseline distributions, then the cell passed the temporal response modulation criterion. For the space-time structure criterion, we performed a two-way ANOVA on the full set of single-trial PSTHs, with space and time as factors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Chen et al., 2011c</a>).

For this reason, we focus mainly on the findings of the VAJ model (but see <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."

This work may be unprecedented in its comprehensive and systematic characterization of neurons at so many different levels of a sensory system, using a common set of stimuli and analysis methods. 579 neurons were recorded in 8 subcortical and cortical regions carrying vestibular signals (otolith afferents, vestibular and cerebellar nuclei, and 5 cortical areas: PIVC, VIP, VPS, MSTd, FEF) during transient, translational vestibular stimuli delivered in 24 directions in 3D space. Neural responses were fit with a model that included velocity, acceleration and jerk, and linear or nonlinear spatio-temporal combinations of these quantities. The analysis is principled, systematic, uniformly applied across brain areas, and validated using simulated neurons with defined coding properties. The authors find that whereas there are clear differences in response selectivity between of primary otolith afferents and central neurons, responses of neurons in vestibular and cerebellar nuclei and five distinct cerebrocortical areas are remarkably similar to each other. The finding of similar spatio-temporal coding properties in all brain regions beyond the otolithic afferents suggests that a key step in the processing of vestibular information is performed at the first synapse. Overall, the work is sound and carefully executed. It is impressive in its completeness, providing a comprehensive picture of vestibular signal transformations across brain regions. The central findings provide a valuable resource for the vestibular field, and provide the opportunity for useful comparisons across sensory modalities. Although generally enthusiastic, the Reviewers had several suggestions for additional analysis, and for how the presentation of the Results and Discussion could be improved to increase the impact of this impressive body of research."

For example, VIP and MSTd are plotted together in C, and this and the superposition of the envelopes of all of the data in D obscures the fact that these two regions actually have quite distinct velocity weights. Similarly, there are many more neurons in 6C (representing MSTd, VIP, FEF) that have 0 acceleration weights (fall along the bottom of the triangle) than in the other plots/ regions, but the envelope representation in 6D obscures that fact. Comparing this (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) approach to data visualization vs. the approach in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, it is not clear to me whether different conclusions about variability across regions are not reached partly because of differences in data analysis/ presentation. In <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, where actual histograms are presented for position components for each region, the conclusion reached is quite different \u2013 that only MSTd has a sizable position component. Would we more easily pick out differences across regions in the velocity/ acceleration/ jerk weights of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> if they had been represented this way (or with cumulative histograms for each of the 3 weights, as in <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)?"

The central cells also have more variability in their separability index than the OAs.

The three sets of curves (gaussian profile and the 2 first derivative) provide a good set of functions of time for the decomposition of PSTHs: e.g. for a simple profile with a peak, the mean/sd of the peak will correspond to the speed, the assymetry (skewness) will correspond to the acceleration, and the sharpness of the peak (kurtosis) will correspond to the jerk. The shape of the PSTH may indeed be conditioned by the sensitivity of a cell to the speed/acceleration/jerk, but alternate causes, such as long-term impact of movement parameters or of past cellular activity (i.e. violation from the \"instantaneous hypothesis\"), might also explain the shape of the PSTH; indeed, this is observed in many examples of the <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, where significant departure from baseline are observed at the end of the psth, when virtually all movement is over for hundreds of milliseconds: see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> (e.g. end of the PSTH Az 315 deg, Elev 45 deg) or <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (e.g. end of Az 270, Elev -45), <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> (e.g. Az 90, Elev 0 deg), <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a> (end of Az 315, Elev 45). All these example suggest that to some degree, the firing of the cells may be affected by past events (movement or cell activity) at much longer time scales than the few tens to hundred milliseconds used for the delay. Therefore, the correspondence between the weights of the fits to a gaussian profile and its first derivatives and an actual sensitivity to velocity, acceleration and jerk is somewhat questionable."

The description of these non-linear function is remarkably obfuscated (described by three successive set of variables: a,b,c in y(x)=a.b^x+c, then by y(-1),y(0),y(1), then by Z0 and k0\u2026.), but the end result is more clearly shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>. One of the important points is that these non-linear functions are not mapping the cosine result (range [-1,1]) onto the full [-1,1] range, but onto a subset of this range. Then, the fit predicts the (spatial dependency of the) rate based on a weighted sum of the non-linearly transformed cosine function. In the MS, theses weights of the components of the fit are used to compare the sensitivities of the cells (e.g. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This procedures calls for a few comments:"

The non-linear version will always do better since it permits a finer tuning (1 more parameter), but the benefit may be only marginal (I think the authors could reasonably easily test this) and come at the price a quite obscure process."

In this case, the large weight of the velocity would correspond only to a small dynamic range over spatial orientations; the same large weight for another cell with cosine tuning would correspond to a full dynamic range over spatial orientations. Therefore, a single value of the weight is mixing qualitatively different information (e.g. speed value as in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>, versus velocity vector as in <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>). The only things that disambiguate the information are the parameters of the non-linear function, but 1) they are not so trivial (the authors found it is easier to report them as 'arbitrary' categories\u2026), 2) they are reported independently from the values of the weight. A linear version of the transformation ('a.cos(x)+b', provided that it would not degrade too much the performance of the fits) could be easier to report and avoid the categorization: 'a' (in the a.cos(x)+b) would signal the dynamic range over 3D, and 'b' would signal the directionaly-invariant component of the response; it would become possible for example to generate bivariate plots (such as 'weight' vs 'a') which would answer simple questions such as: is the dynamic range for velocity coding identical in all brain areas for strongly velocity-tuned cells? Currently, the choice of reporting makes the answer to this question unclear. Since some of their conclusion is that there are no regional differences, I do not feel so certain they took the most powerful approach to reveal them."

The three sets of curves (gaussian profile and the 2 first derivative) provide a good set of functions of time for the decomposition of PSTHs: e.g. for a simple profile with a peak, the mean/sd of the peak will correspond to the speed, the assymetry (skewness) will correspond to the acceleration, and the sharpness of the peak (kurtosis) will correspond to the jerk. The shape of the PSTH may indeed be conditioned by the sensitivity of a cell to the speed/acceleration/jerk, but alternate causes, such as long-term impact of movement parameters or of past cellular activity (i.e. violation from the \"instantaneous hypothesis\"), might also explain the shape of the PSTH; indeed, this is observed in many examples of the <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, where significant departure from baseline are observed at the end of the psth, when virtually all movement is over for hundreds of milliseconds: see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> (e.g. end of the PSTH Az 315 deg, Elev 45 deg) or <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (e.g. end of Az 270, Elev -45), <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> (e.g. Az 90, Elev 0 deg), <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a> (end of Az 315, Elev 45). All these example suggest that to some degree, the firing of the cells may be affected by past events (movement or cell activity) at much longer time scales than the few tens to hundred milliseconds used for the delay. Therefore, the correspondence between the weights of the fits to a gaussian profile and its first derivatives and an actual sensitivity to velocity, acceleration and jerk is somewhat questionable.</i> "

However, we also acknowledge that our model is essentially descriptive and not mechanistic. Therefore, the dynamic responses that we attribute to velocity or jerk could be the result of non-linear dynamic processes of a more complex nature than simple integration or differentiation. In other words, our model is limited to describing spatiotemporal dynamics as a combination of basis functions that are related to the stimulus, rather than as a combination of inputs to each neuron. While the latter type of model may be possible, we feel that it would be a major undertaking and may not be sufficiently constrained to be successful. Despite this limitation (which is now added to the Discussion), we think that our approach still adequately characterizes the nature of the transformations of vestibular signals."

In this case, the large weight of the velocity would correspond only to a small dynamic range over spatial orientations; the same large weight for another cell with cosine tuning would correspond to a full dynamic range over spatial orientations. Therefore, a single value of the weight is mixing qualitatively different information (e.g. speed value as in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>, versus velocity vector as in <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>). The only things that disambiguate the information are the parameters of the non-linear function, but 1) they are not so trivial (the authors found it is easier to report them as 'arbitrary' categories\u2026), 2) they are reported independently from the values of the weight. A linear version of the transformation ('a.cos(x)+b', provided that it would not degrade too much the performance of the fits) could be easier to report and avoid the categorization: 'a' (in the a.cos(x)+b) would signal the dynamic range over 3D, and 'b' would signal the directionaly-invariant component of the response; it would become possible for example to generate bivariate plots (such as 'weight' vs 'a') which would answer simple questions such as: is the dynamic range for velocity coding identical in all brain areas for strongly velocity-tuned cells? Currently, the choice of reporting makes the answer to this question unclear. Since some of their conclusion is that there are no regional differences, I do not feel so certain they took the most powerful approach to reveal them.</i> "
