Previously, we showed that regenerating stem cells in the axolotl spinal cord revert to a molecular state resembling embryonic neuroepithelial cells and functionally acquire rapid proliferative divisions (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015</a>). Here, we refine the analysis of cell proliferation in space and time and identify a high-proliferation zone in the regenerating spinal cord that shifts posteriorly over time. By tracking sparsely-labeled cells, we also quantify cell influx into the regenerate. Taking a mathematical modeling approach, we integrate these quantitative datasets of cell proliferation, neural stem cell activation and cell influx, to predict regenerative tissue outgrowth. Our model shows that while cell influx and neural stem cell activation play a minor role, the acceleration of the cell cycle is the major driver of regenerative spinal cord outgrowth in axolotls."

Previously, we showed that regenerating stem cells in the axolotl spinal cord revert to a molecular state resembling embryonic neuroepithelial cells and functionally acquire rapid proliferative divisions (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015</a>). Here, we refine the analysis of cell proliferation in space and time and identify a high-proliferation zone in the regenerating spinal cord that shifts posteriorly over time. By tracking sparsely-labeled cells, we also quantify cell influx into the regenerate. Taking a mathematical modeling approach, we integrate these quantitative datasets of cell proliferation, neural stem cell activation and cell influx, to predict regenerative tissue outgrowth. Our model shows that while cell influx and neural stem cell activation play a minor role, the acceleration of the cell cycle is the major driver of regenerative spinal cord outgrowth in axolotls."

In axolotls, this is best exemplified following tail amputation, when cells adjacent to the cut end regrow a fully functional spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib10\">Holtzer, 1956</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Mchedlishvili et al., 2007</a>). Despite the regenerative potential of axolotl neural stem cells, little was known about the molecular changes occurring upon them and the changes in cell behavior that lead to the rapid expansion of the stem cell pool during regeneration."

There, we found that resident SOX2<sup>+</sup> neural stem cells re-activate an embryonic-like gene expression program following tail amputation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015</a>). Part of this program involves the re-establishment of planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, the downregulation of pro-neural genes, and upregulation of proliferation-promoting genes. In line with these gene expression changes, we also found that regenerating neural stem cells speed up their cell cycle, and switch from neuron-generating to proliferative cell divisions. PCP turned out to be key for the efficient and orderly expansion of the regenerating spinal cord, at least in part by instructing cells to divide along the growing axis. However, besides oriented cell division, whether other cellular mechanisms such as convergence and extension, which leads to the narrowing and lengthening of tissues, are involved in the rapid expansion of the regenerating spinal cord remained unknown."

To address this question, we apply a quantitative modeling approach to causally link previous (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015</a>) and new datasets to the time-course of spinal cord outgrowth. In particular, we calculate neural stem cell density from previous measurements (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015</a>) to show that convergence and extension is negligible. We make use of cell proliferation-related measurements along the anterior-posterior axis (AP) of the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015</a>) to identify a high-proliferation zone, which initially extends 800 \u03bcm anterior to the amputation plane, and calculate changes in cell cycle kinetics within this zone. By tracing sparsely-labelled cells, we also determine the\u00a0cell influx into the regenerating spinal cord. Finally, we set up a mathematical model of spinal cord outgrowth that incorporates cell proliferation, neural stem cell activation, and cell influx. Using this model, we test the contribution of each of these cellular mechanisms to the regenerative spinal cord outgrowth. Comparing the model predictions with experimental data of tissue outgrowth we show that while cell influx and activation of quiescent neural stem cells play a minor role, the acceleration of the cell cycle in the high-proliferation zone is the major driver of the observed regenerative spinal cord outgrowth."

To quantitatively investigate neural stem cell arrangement in space and time, we revisited our previously published dataset of the number of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells per cross section in uninjured and regenerating spinal cords (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and see Materials and methods) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015</a>). We found that the number of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells per spinal cord cross section is constant along the AP axis in both uninjured and regenerating samples at any time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,B\u2019</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and see Materials and methods). We also found that the number of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells per cross section spatially averaged along the AP axis is constant during regeneration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and see Materials and methods). On average, 30.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells make up the circumference of the axolotl spinal cord. Since the length of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells along the AP axis does not change during regeneration (<i>l<sub>c</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a013.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 \u03bcm) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015</a>), the density of cells along the AP axis is spatially homogeneous and equal to 2.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 cells/\u03bcm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

                                "text": "To determine spatial and temporal changes in cell proliferation during regeneration, we calculated different cell proliferation parameters along uninjured and regenerating spinal cords. In our previous study, we quantified the number of proliferative cells, i.e. SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells that are positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the number of cells in mitosis, i.e. SOX2<sup>+</sup>/PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells with condensed chromosomes based on Hoechst DNA stain (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015</a>). Here, we used these datasets to estimate the growth fraction, i.e. the fraction of proliferative cells and the mitotic index, i.e. the ratio of mitotic cells over proliferative cells. Although neither SOX2<sup>+</sup>/PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells nor mitotic cells showed any evident spatial pattern along the AP axis in uninjured animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, points), they showed a tendency to increase posteriorly from day 4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2019</a>, points). To elucidate whether proliferation was patterned along the AP axis during regeneration, we tested the data with a mathematical model of two spatially homogeneous zones characterized by their growth fraction and mitotic index and separated by a border that we call the <i>switchpoint</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,E\u2019</a>). We reasoned that in the absence of an AP pattern of cell proliferation the two zones would be indistinguishable; while if cell proliferation would be locally increased, the model would allow us to determine the magnitude and the location of the increased cell proliferation. For a given growth fraction and mitotic index, the model predicts the expected number of proliferative cells and mitotic cells per cross section (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Hence, we fitted the model to the cell number datasets of uninjured and regenerating spinal cords at day 3, 4, 6 and 8 after amputation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,D\u2019</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) to determine the growth fraction, the mitotic index, and the switchpoint for each time point (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013F\u2019\u2019</a>). Not surprisingly, we found that in the uninjured spinal cord the growth fraction and the mitotic index in the two modeled zones are not significantly different (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,F,F\u2019</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Similarly, at day 3 there are no significant differences between the two zones (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,F\u2019</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In contrast, the growth fraction and the mitotic index are higher in the posterior zone from day 4 onward (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2019,F,F\u2019</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These findings reveal that a high-proliferation zone emerges in the regenerating spinal cord at day 4. At this time point, the switchpoint between the two zones is located 800\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0100 \u03bcm anterior to the amputation plane, but shows the tendency to shift posteriorly as the regenerating spinal cord grows (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2019\u2019</a>)."

We find that the proliferation rate is 0.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 per day in the uninjured spinal cord which corresponds to a cell cycle length of 10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 days (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). The proliferation rate is similar at day 3.

We estimated the total number of quiescent cells in the high-proliferation zone from the mean number of SOX2<sup>+</sup>/PCNA<sup>-</sup> cells per cross section, the mean AP cell length, and the outgrowth time-course (see Materials and methods). The number of SOX2<sup>+</sup>/PCNA<sup>-</sup> cells drops from 180\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030 at day 0 to 23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013 at day 6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>) which suggests that quiescent SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells get activated and re-enter the cell cycle upon injury.

From the clone trajectories, we calculated the mean clone velocity at different positions along the AP axis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a> and see Materials and methods).

In line with this, we found a high-proliferation zone, first spanning from 800 \u03bcm anterior to the amputation plane, and showed that the increase in cell proliferation is due to both (i) the acceleration of the cell cycle and (ii) the activation of quiescent stem cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013H</a>). The influx of cells that we identified could also contribute to increasing cell numbers in the regenerating spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I\u2013K</a>). To assess the contribution of these cellular mechanisms to the outgrowth time-course, we used a quantitative mathematical modeling framework (<a href=\"#bib9\">Greulich and Simons, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ru\u00e9 and Martinez Arias, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Oates et al., 2009</a>). We formalized the influence of each cellular mechanism on the total number of proliferative and quiescent SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells in the high-proliferation zone in a mathematical model of cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, see Materials and methods, <a href=\"#equ3\">Equations 3 and 4</a>). As cell density along the AP axis is constant, the cell number is proportional to the AP length of the growing high-proliferation zone. Hence, we can transform the model of cell numbers into an equivalent model for the tissue geometry that predicts the spinal cord outgrowth, <i>L</i>(<i>t</i>), and growth fraction, <i>GF</i>(<i>t</i>) at time <i>t</i>:"

This predicted a maximum outgrowth of 1.7 mm (p=0.003) which is 0.6 mm shorter than the observed outgrowth at day 8.

In contrast, switching off cell influx (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) or the activation of quiescent neural stem cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) has almost no effect on the predicted outgrowth, which suggests that these cellular mechanisms are not major drivers of regenerative spinal cord outgrowth.

It is however clear that although the potential to replace lost cells or tissue exists in other species, they are not as efficient as axolotls at resolving spinal cord injuries. A more comprehensive characterization of cell proliferation responses is thus needed to understand fundamental differences between species with different regenerative capabilities. In our previous study, we uncovered that spinal cord stem cells in the axolotl speed up their cell cycle during regeneration (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015</a>). Performing detailed quantifications, we were now able to delineate a high-proliferation zone that initially spans from the 800 \u03bcm adjacent to the amputation plane to the regenerating tip, and later shifts posteriorly as the spinal cord regrows. Although some quiescent neural stem cells enter the cell cycle during regeneration, we demonstrate that the observed increase in proliferation is primarily due to the acceleration of the cell cycle within the regenerating neural stem cell pool. By performing experiments in silico using our mechanistic model of spinal cord regeneration, we demonstrate that the acceleration of the cell cycle can explain the observed spinal cord outgrowth."

Indeed, <i>Sox2</i>-knockout cells express PCNA and are in theory able to proliferate, but their lower incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2\u2019-deoxyuridine (EdU) suggests that they cannot speed up the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fei et al., 2014</a>). We were able to show that the reduced outgrowth in <i>Sox2</i>-knockout spinal cords can be quantitatively explained by the lack of cell cycle acceleration (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, it is important to point out that our model does not include the regulation of individual cellular mechanisms and thus it does not consider compensatory mechanisms that may operate under perturbed conditions. To apply our model to the <i>Sox2</i>-knockout dataset, we assumed that knocking out <i>Sox2</i> only affects the acceleration of the cell cycle. The fact that the model successfully recapitulated the experimental outgrowth in the <i>Sox2-</i>knockout scenario suggests that compensatory mechanisms might have a small contribution in this condition.

Cells move along the AP axis of the spinal cord but maintain their relative position: cells translocate faster the closer they are to the amputation plane (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,K</a>). In line with earlier work (<a href=\"#bib17\">Mchedlishvili et al., 2007</a>), we found that cells initially located within the 500 \u03bcm anterior to the amputation plane contribute to the regenerated spinal cord; while cells outside this zone translocate slower, and cells at 800 \u03bcm, the border of the high-proliferation zone, almost do not move. This would be consistent with a model in which cells are passively displaced, pushed by more anterior dividing cells. In this model, the more posterior a cell is the more cells anterior to that cell divide and the stronger is the push, making the cell translocate faster (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Importantly, the proliferative response extends beyond the 500 \u03bcm anterior to the amputation plane that gives rise to the regenerated spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib17\">Mchedlishvili et al., 2007</a>). In the light of this model, it is plausible that cells in the posterior 500 \u03bcm of the high-proliferation zone regenerate the spinal cord while cells from the anterior 300 \u03bcm of the high-proliferation zone replenish and push out the 500 \u03bcm regeneration source zone."

First, it was tested if the cell count data linearly depends on spatial position along the AP axis using Bayesian inference (see \u2018Constant density\u2019\u00a0in <a href=\"#bib22\">Rost et al., 2016a</a>).

If the data for the specific section was missing, <i>N<sub>S</sub></i> was computed by assuming that there is a constant expected number of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells per cross section and that the deviations from the expected value follow a normal distribution. The mean and standard deviation of this normal distribution were estimated by the sample mean and standard deviation of the sample of the measured numbers of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells per cross section for each replicate. The number of SOX2<sup>+</sup>cells\u00a0in a cross section is independent from other cross sections. The state \u2018Proliferative\u2019, i.e. SOX2<sup>+</sup>/PCNA<sup>+</sup>, is independently assigned to each SOX2<sup>+</sup> cell with probability <i>p<sub>p</sub></i> or \u2018Quiescent\u2019 with probability 1 \u2013 <i>p<sub>p</sub></i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Hence, for a given number of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells in a cross section, <i>N<sub>S</sub></i>, the number of SOX2<sup>+</sup>/PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells per cross section, <i>N<sub>P</sub></i>, follows a binomial distribution with <i>N<sub>s</sub></i> experiments and success probability <i>p<sub>p</sub></i>. Consequently, the expected growth fraction equals <i>p<sub>p</sub></i>. As the number of mitotic cells, <i>N<sub>M</sub></i>, in 3D 50 \u00b5m sections was measured previously, we estimated the number of SOX2<sup>+</sup>/PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells also in a 3D 50 \u00b5m section, <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><msub><mi>N</mi><mrow><mi>P</mi><mi>S</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>50</mn><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi><mi>m</mi><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>l</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u00a0</mo><mo>\u22c5</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>P</mi></msub></mrow></math>, where <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><msub><mi>l</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>13.2</mn><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.1</mn><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></math> is the mean AP length of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015</a>). Assuming that the cell cycle position and hence the cell cycle phase of each cell is independent of all other cells, the state \u2018Proliferative, mitotic\u2019 is independently assigned to each SOX2<sup>+</sup>/PCNA<sup>+</sup> cell with probability <i>p<sub>m</sub></i> or \u2018Proliferative, non-mitotic\u2019 with probability 1 \u2013 <i>p<sub>m</sub></i>. Hence, the number of mitotic cells per section, <i>N<sub>M</sub></i>, follows a binomial distribution with <i>N<sub>PS</sub></i> experiments and success probability <i>p<sub>m</sub></i>. Consequently, the expected mitotic index equals <i>p<sub>m</sub></i>. For given values of <i>p<sub>p</sub></i> and <i>p<sub>m</sub></i> the model gives a likelihood for the observed number of SOX2<sup>+</sup>/PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells per cross section and mitotic cells per 3D section that can be used to fit the model parameters. To reflect the assumption of two spatial proliferation zones, <i>p<sub>p</sub></i> and <i>p<sub>m</sub></i> have spatial dependencies in the form of step functions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2019</a>). Hence, there can be different growth fractions and mitotic indices for the anterior and the posterior zone, respectively. The spatial position of the border between the zones is another model parameter termed <i>switchpoint</i>. Furthermore, variability between replicates in the switchpoint is modeled as a normal distribution with standard deviation <math id=\"inf3\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>.

Hence, the resulting model to describe the cell count data of all replicates at a given time point has eight parameters: the switchpoint, growth fraction and mitotic index in the anterior zone and in the posterior zone, respectively, and the inter-replicate variabilities <math id=\"inf6\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>, <math id=\"inf7\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>G</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math> and <math id=\"inf8\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>. Those parameters were estimated with Bayesian inference using uniform priors for uninjured animals and at 3, 4, 6 and 8 days. Fitting was performed using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm implemented in pymc (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013F\u2019\u2019</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, see also \u2018step_model_fixed_density_fit_per_timepoint\u2019\u00a0in\u00a0<a href=\"#bib22\">Rost et al., 2016a</a>). To verify the fitting procedure, test data were created by simulating our model with picked parameter values. These 'true' parameter values were then found to be included in the 95% credibility intervals of the parameter values inferred from the test data with our fitting procedure."

The confidence intervals of the model prediction were estimated with a Monte Carlo approach using bootstrapping with a case resampling scheme (100,000 iterations). In each iteration, we case-resampled the cell count data, the BrdU incorporation data and the clone trajectory data, and calculated the proliferation rate time-course, clone velocity at \u2212800 \u00b5m and initial growth fraction from this resampled data as described above. Then, in each iteration, these bootstrapped parameter values were used to estimate the activation rate <i>k</i> by fitting the model prediction of the growth fraction to the data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The growth fraction measurement of day 8 was excluded from the fit because its precise value would only affect the model prediction after this day. Now, as all parameters were estimated, an outgrowth trajectory was calculated for each iteration. This ensemble of trajectories was used to calculate the confidence intervals of the model prediction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The same approach was used for the model scenarios with individual cellular mechanisms turned off (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013G</a>).

This could be either due to their control CRISPR treatment or due to their reduced feeding. To account for the reduced growth, we assumed that all cellular mechanisms maintain the same relative contribution in Fei and colleagues\u2019 control as they have in normal regeneration. This assumption allowed linear rescaling of the outgrowth dataset from Fei and colleagues to match our \u2018normal\u2019 outgrowth dataset (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, \u2018lg_model\u2019\u00a0in\u00a0<a href=\"#bib22\">Rost et al., 2016a</a>). We also assumed that <i>Sox2</i>-knockout only affects the acceleration of the cell cycle but that all other cellular mechanisms remain unaffected (i.e. compensatory mechanisms are not considered). Fewer neural stem cells make up the circumference of <i>Sox2</i>-knockout spinal cords (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fei et al., 2014</a>).

The authors reasoned that this increased proliferation could be due to 1) changes in the cell proliferation rate, 2) activation of quiescent cells, and 3) cell influx into the regenerating spinal cord."

To do so, we (i) measured spinal cord outgrowth during regeneration (at the tissue level) and (ii) quantified different cellular mechanisms that underlie this process (at the cell level). We then used the cell-level datasets to build the model, which we used to predict tissue outgrowth. These tissue outgrowth predictions were tested against the experimentally observed tissue outgrowth dataset. Thus, this tissue-level dataset was not used to derive the model but rather to validate it. Next, to assess the contribution of each cellular mechanism to normal regenerative spinal cord outgrowth, we switched them off one by one in silico. Here, we agree with the reviewers that these predictions would be strengthened when tested against an independent experimental dataset in which one of the cellular mechanisms is blocked. However, a motivation to develop the model (and a limitation to validate its predictions in perturbed conditions) is that we know little about how these cellular mechanisms are regulated in the axolotl \u2013 except for the acceleration of the cell cycle. As mentioned in the first version of this paper and cited by the reviewers, knocking out <i>Sox2</i> hinders the acceleration of the cell cycle during spinal cord regeneration in axolotls (PMCID: PMC4266004). In this revised version of the manuscript, we have followed the reviewers\u2019 suggestion to validate the model on the <i>Sox2</i>-knockout dataset from Fei and colleagues (PMCID: PMC4266004, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We now show that our model can explain the reduced regenerative outgrowth in <i>Sox2</i>-knockout spinal cords when the acceleration of the cell cycle is switched off. Please refer to <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; subsection \u201cCell proliferation drives the outgrowth of the regenerating spinal cord\u201d, last paragraph; Discussion, fourth paragraph subsection \u201cValidation of a model prediction against an experimental dataset\u201d in Results, Discussion and Materials and methods, respectively."

However, the fact that our model, without considering compensatory mechanisms, can predict the reduced outgrowth when the acceleration of cell proliferation is blocked (as described above) suggests that there is not massive compensation by one of the other mechanisms during regeneration. We now comment on this in the Discussion, fourth paragraph."
