An agent-based model is developed that extends earlier \u2018strain theory\u2019 by addressing the <i>var</i> gene family of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. The model explicitly considers the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression. It tracks the dynamics of all unique <i>var</i> repertoires in a population of hosts, and shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition mediated through cross-immunity structures the parasite population into a subset of coexisting dominant repertoires of <i>var</i> genes whose degree of antigenic overlap depends on transmission intensity. Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports this role for immune selection in structuring parasite diversity."

An agent-based model is developed that extends earlier \u2018strain theory\u2019 by addressing the <i>var</i> gene family of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. The model explicitly considers the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression. It tracks the dynamics of all unique <i>var</i> repertoires in a population of hosts, and shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition mediated through cross-immunity structures the parasite population into a subset of coexisting dominant repertoires of <i>var</i> genes whose degree of antigenic overlap depends on transmission intensity. Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports this role for immune selection in structuring parasite diversity."

An extensive variety of microparasites have been studied in this context: protozoa, such as <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, <i>Leishmania</i>, and <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>; viruses, such as <i>Influenza</i>, <i>HIV</i> and <i>Dengue</i>; and bacteria, such as <i>E. coli</i>, <i>Bordetella spp.</i> and <i>Neisseria meningitides</i> (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tibayrenc et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gupta et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tibayrenc and Ayala, 2002</a>)."

The complexities of its population genetics, in terms of the variable and often enormous levels of sequence variation observed at antigenic sites within local populations, are intimately tied to both its pathology and its ability to escape immune detection. While this genetic complexity provides significant challenges to malaria research and control, it also provides an opportunity to extend existing strain theory in a way that can be tested empirically. Specifically, an important extension of earlier strain theory is to consider the effects of immune selection in populations of pathogens whose antigen-encoding loci are: (a) multi-copy and recombining (i.e., located on different chromosomes of a haploid genome), and (b) undergoing antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression within an infected host. It is not clear whether a stable strain structure would emerge under the sequential expression of multi-copy genes. Consideration of this type of system provides a more complete framework for understanding antigenic structure and its epidemiological consequences in a broader variety of pathogens; it also offers the opportunity to distinguish the effects of immune selection from those of neutral demographic forces, providing testable predictions for these two alternative mechanisms."

Reliable numerical results require the simulation of explicit transmission events, as well as complete knowledge of the exposure history of each individual host with respect to past and present infections by different parasite genomes. Thus, an agent-based model is formulated that follows each host from birth to death, while recording their exposure history and the specific immunity each gradually gains as a result of infections (for a detailed description of the model see the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section)."

Despite this large potential diversity, simulation results show that only a few dominant <i>var</i> repertoires circulate and persist at any given time, effectively keeping <i>var</i> repertoire diversity orders of magnitude lower than is potentially possible given the number of <i>var</i> genes present in the host population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We find that epidemiological dynamics significantly limit the diversity of coexisting dominant genomes under a broad spectrum of transmission intensities. This pattern persists in the long-term, far out-living the influence of initial conditions, and persisting through occasional changes in the identity of the dominant <i>var</i> repertoires (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

Despite the changing identities of the dominant <i>var</i> repertoires, the overall diversity of repertoires present and the individual gene frequencies remain remarkably constant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, lower panels). These transient phenomena punctuate periods of stasis with stable population structure. In essence, although there are an effectively infinite number of niches in host immunity space, <i>var</i> repertoires appear to exploit this space by partitioning it into a number of discrete and partially overlapping niches. In addition, these repertoires appear to quickly adapt and achieve some optimum after perturbations arising from the stochastic nature of the underlying demographic and transmission processes. The episodes of restructuring become more frequent as recombination rates increase, but the diversity of dominant <i>var</i> repertoires remains low throughout these semi-stable states. Indeed, the maintenance of structure is found to be robust even under very high levels of recombination (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The emergence of pathogen population structure is robust to alternative formulations of our multi-locus model that do not consider sequential expression, or formulations that consider randomly ordered sequential expression.

Based on sequence features (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bull et al., 2007</a>), and the fact that genomic organization of <i>var</i> sequence groups appear to be conserved across globally distributed isolates (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kyes et al., 2007</a>), it is very unlikely that <i>var</i> type 22 (being UpsA-like) is physically linked to the other alleles in the network (since they are all UpsB/UpsC-like).

This reduction in diversity occurs because coexisting parasites are structured into a few variants with largely discordant repertoires. In a departure from previous strain theory, our model predicts that the different dominant repertoires can exhibit partial overlap; the extent of the overlap increases with transmission intensity and this, in turn, influences observed epidemiological patterns (particularly age-serology profiles)."

Observations of individuals becoming susceptible to severe infection at later stages of their life (see for example (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dhingra et al., 2010</a>)), may be in part a consequence of short-lived immunity. Under this assumption, hosts in our model regain protection by exposure to one of the dominant strains circulating in the host population at high frequencies, and do so at a sufficiently high rate to preserve strain population structure except at extremely low transmission intensity. In the event that a host is infected by one of the low frequency genomes that are continuously being introduced (and equally quickly vanishing), it is highly unlikely that this successful transmission event is sufficient for invasion or even replacement of the currently dominating strain community."

This underscores the role of strain diversity structure, rather than diversity per se, in determining observed epidemiological patterns and their response to intervention. By reducing antigenic overlap between strains, vector control efforts will result in infection at an older age and a more gradual acquisition of protection to infection, even in the absence of changes in <i>var</i> gene diversity. The model in its current form does not differentiate infection from clinical disease, thus we cannot explicitly address the impact of control on the severity of symptoms. However, if the number of <i>var</i> genes that a host has previously encountered relates to the degree of protection against clinical disease, we would expect more severe symptoms to occur at younger ages under high transmission settings, and in contrast, more homogeneous malaria incidents are likely to occur over a broader range of age-classes when transmission is lowered (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Investigation of these patterns awaits the formulation of models that include functional, non-antigenic, differences between strains, as well as more empirical understanding of the role played by <i>var</i> genes associated with more severe disease. Future work should thus extend our model to consider functional, non-antigen-encoding differences between <i>var</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bull et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Miller et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Scherf et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buckee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Claessens et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Severins et al., 2012</a> for an example of a recent model applied to questions on the evolution of virulence).

Consequently, they have proposed that <i>var</i> typing be used to complement prevalence measures for molecular surveillance of malaria control and elimination efforts. Our models support this proposal as they show that decreasing transmission provokes nonlinear changes in the dominant <i>var</i> configurations. Importantly, our results demonstrate that there is not a simple relationship between <i>var</i> diversity and repertoire diversity. Indeed, the \u2018<i>var</i> strain\u2019 model suggests that vector control strategies that reduce transmission will not always drastically reduce <i>var</i> gene diversity, because a reservoir of parasite genomes with diverse (highly non-overlapping) <i>var</i> repertoires will remain. This insight from the model provides a plausible explanation for why it is so difficult to eliminate malaria: non-overlapping <i>var</i> diversity will create significant inherent difficulties in reducing the potential of the malaria parasite to reinfect the same hosts. It also suggests that <i>var</i> surveillance might provide a good molecular means of evaluating control.

However, in our model we assume that the actual transmission probability of each of the genomes, is divided by the total number of co-infecting genomes at the time of the biting event.

For these different rules we find similar results to those presented here. The alternative rules for within host dynamics of multiple infections are: (1) <i>Co-infection, no cost</i>: during the course of co-infection, there is no cost on the transmission probability of each of the infecting genomes, and hence the transmissibility of each remains, <i>\u03c4</i>, identical to what it would be, had there been no other infecting genomes. (2) <i>Co-infection, full cost</i>: during the course of co-infection, the transmissibility of the earliest infecting genome is not compromised by the later infections and stands at <i>\u03c4</i>, all later infections are not transmissible. When the earliest infection is cleared it is the next one that becomes fully transmissible. (3) <i>Mutually exclusive infections</i>: here, co-infections are not permitted; while a host is infected with one infection, it is not susceptible to any other. (4) <i>Delayed super-infection</i>: a host can harbor multiple parasite genomes, but only one actively infects the host, with transmissibility <i>\u03c4</i>, while the rest remain latent until the active parasite genome is cleared. After that, one of the latent parasite genomes begins its active state until it is cleared, and so on."

The algorithm considers that these processes are Poisson and determines, based on these rates, the timing of each of these events. We further consider that the population size is constant in time, such that in the case of a death, a new susceptible host is born, replacing the previous host that died. We assume that this new host has no history of exposure, nor any acquired immunity. At a \u2018biting event\u2019, a vector bites two randomly chosen hosts sequentially, if the first host is actively infected by one or several parasite genomes at that time, there is a probability for each of these to be transmitted to the second host. As noted earlier, this probability depends on transmission probability, <i>\u03c4</i>, and on the number of co-infecting parasite genomes. A parasite genome that is transmitted from one host to another, has a probability <i>\u03c8</i> of mutating, such that one of its randomly chosen <i>var</i> genes is replaced by a randomly chosen variant from the pool. This new genome is then the one transmitted to the second host. When two or more parasite genomes are successfully transmitted from the first host to a mosquito, there is a given probability, \u03c1, that recombination occurs, resulting in a new <i>var</i> repertoire that is then transmitted from the mosquito to the second host. In this case, the novel combination is formed by randomly sampling a subset of <i>var</i> genes from each of the parent repertoires. Hence, when \u03c1&gt;0, this effectively leads to a continuous reshuffling of <i>var</i> repertoires circulating in the host population. Given the extensive number of possible <i>var</i> combinations, these recombination events often introduce de novo parasite genomes not yet present in the infected host population. Epidemiologically, after the introduction of a de novo genome, this parasite may successfully be transmitted multiple times, possibly leading to an epidemic, and persisting in the host population for extended periods of time. Alternatively, however, it may be unsuccessful in its transmission, persisting only for a short duration of time before stochastically going extinct."

This paper extends strain theory to treat the malaria parasite, by demonstrating the effects on immune selection upon a multi-gene system with sequential expression, as characteristic of the <i>var</i> gene family, which is central to the within-host antigenic variation of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. On the theoretical side, the authors have answered the question of whether immune selection can cause the parasite population to self-organise into a finite number of strains with non-overlapping <i>var</i> repertoires even when the genes are expressed sequentially. They have further shown that the degree of structuring depends on transmission intensity: partially overlapping repertoires can arise when transmission levels are high. On the empirical side, the paper presents an analysis of microsatellite and <i>var</i> DBL\u03b1 sequence data, revealing that linkage disequilibrium among the latter cannot be attributed to demographic forces alone. The following comments should be addressed before acceptance:"
