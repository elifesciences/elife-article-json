We found that rats helped trapped strangers by releasing them from a restrainer, just as they did cagemates. However, rats did not help strangers of a different strain, unless previously housed with the trapped rat. Moreover, pair-housing with one rat of a different strain prompted rats to help strangers of that strain, evidence that rats expand pro-social motivation from one individual to phenotypically similar others. To test if genetic relatedness alone can motivate helping, rats were fostered from birth with another strain and were not exposed to their own strain. As adults, fostered rats helped strangers of the fostering strain but not rats of their own strain. Thus, strain familiarity, even to one\u2019s own strain, is required for the expression of pro-social behavior."

We found that rats helped trapped strangers by releasing them from a restrainer, just as they did cagemates. However, rats did not help strangers of a different strain, unless previously housed with the trapped rat. Moreover, pair-housing with one rat of a different strain prompted rats to help strangers of that strain, evidence that rats expand pro-social motivation from one individual to phenotypically similar others. To test if genetic relatedness alone can motivate helping, rats were fostered from birth with another strain and were not exposed to their own strain. As adults, fostered rats helped strangers of the fostering strain but not rats of their own strain. Thus, strain familiarity, even to one\u2019s own strain, is required for the expression of pro-social behavior."

When tested with a cagemate trapped inside the tube, most free rats learned within a few days to release the trapped rat by opening the door. Ben-Ami Bartal et al. then exposed the free rats to strangers they had never met or seen before. Remarkably the rats consistently released the trapped stranger, acting toward strangers just as they had acted toward familiar cagemates. This result suggested that individual familiarity is not required for helping to occur."

To distinguish between these possibilities, albino rats were housed for 2 weeks with a rat of a different strain, and then re-housed with another albino rat before being tested with a trapped rat belonging to a different strain.

To do this albino pups were transferred to litters of a different strain on the day they were born, and never saw or interacted with another albino rat until testing. Remarkably, the albino rats helped strangers from the different strain that they were raised with, but they did not help strangers of their own strain because this strain was unfamiliar to them. The fact that the motivation to help other rats has its origins in social interactions rather than genetics provides the flexibility that is needed to navigate their way through social environments that often change unexpectedly."

We previously found that Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats learn to release SD cagemates trapped in a restrainer (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2011</a>). Here, we set out to investigate how previous social experience acquired during development and adulthood influences helping behavior. First, we tested whether rats will help unfamiliar individuals, strangers. Rats showed helping behavior equally towards cagemates and strangers, if the strangers were of their own strain. However, rats did not help strangers of an unfamiliar strain, suggesting that helping in rats may be innately biased towards the helper\u2019s own strain. Yet, further experiments demonstrated that a short period of pair-housing with a rat of the unfamiliar strain was sufficient to motivate helping for that individual. Moreover, rats that had previously lived with a rat of a different strain were as motivated to help strangers of that strain as they were to help strangers of their own strain. This finding demonstrates that rats choose to help others depending on the social context, and extend pro-social motivation beyond individual identity, to groups defined by strain. Finally, we sought to determine if genetic relatedness is at all capable of influencing pro-social motivation towards an unfamiliar rat. We found that rats that were fostered from birth with another strain did not help strangers of their own strain as adults. Fostered rats only acted pro-socially towards rats of the foster strain, demonstrating that genetic relatedness alone is not capable of producing pro-social motivation."

Here we refer to stocks as strains.) The door to the restrainer could only be opened from the outside and thus only by the free rat. Door-opening by the free rat led to the trapped rat\u2019s release from the restrainer. If a free rat failed to open the door within 40 min, the experimenter opened it halfway, allowing the trapped rat to exit the restrainer. Only door-openings resulting from the free rat\u2019s action, during the first 40 min of each session, were counted as such.

As red dots indicate other SD pups, the number of red dots is representative of the amount of exposure each fostered SD rat had to other SD pups during their lives. Individual rats are arranged from the most exposure to SD rats (upper left in each group) to the least exposure (bottom right). Following P11, no fostered rat was exposed to other SD rats until testing. In two cases (both in the fostered+SD condition illustrated in <b>B</b>), the SD pup in the LE litter died at a later date (P11, P12). In these cases, an SD male who had been removed from an LE litter 5 or 7 days before was then re-added to the LE litter. Note that only one animal (upper left in <b>B</b>) was exposed to SD rats with his eyes open; this rat proved to be the only door-opener in the fostered+SD condition. Lines above the dots represent the strain of the dam (red: SD; black: LE)."

The experiments delineated above are not informative of the sensory modalities participating in the classification of strangers as similar or different to the cagemate. Previous research points to the importance of vision, olfaction and audition for affective communication between mice (<a href=\"#bib35\">Langford et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jeon et al., 2010</a>).

This finding is congruent with studies showing that neither kinship nor perceived similarity is needed to motivate pro-social behavior in primates (<a href=\"#bib5\">Batson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Horner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baden et al., 2013</a>). In nature, social animals typically live with related others, and thus a pro-social bias favoring familiar others would also favor genetically similar others. Yet, relying on social experience rather than genetic similarity for guiding pro-social behavior has an added value in that it allows animals to flexibly adapt to different circumstances (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dugatkin, 2002</a>).

We have previously excluded the possibilities that door-opening depends on reward from either motor mastery or social contact (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2011</a>). In addition it is unlikely that rats were motivated to open the restrainer by aggressive or anti-social motivations (<a href=\"#bib43\">Myer and White, 1965</a>) because conflict between the free and trapped rats was minimal for opener pairs. As non-openers tested with an unfamiliar strain were not less active before door-opening than openers tested with a familiar strain (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), differences in general arousal cannot account for the observed results. Given the greater interest in the trapped rat shown by openers and the lack of aggressive interactions between opener pairs, the authors favor the interpretation that rats open the restrainer door in order to terminate the trapped rat\u2019s distress."

Indeed, movement velocity was greater for rats tested with cagemates compared to those tested with strangers, indicative of different motivational states or magnitudes. Nonetheless, rats were sufficiently motivated to help strangers. This result is consistent with previous demonstrations of helping behavior expressed toward strangers in other animals, including humans (<a href=\"#bib59\">Warneken and Tomasello, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Batson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Loggia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Custance and Mayer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tan and Hare, 2013</a>). While emotional contagion has been demonstrated for both individually familiar and unfamiliar mouse pairs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jeon et al., 2010</a>), it may be facilitated by individual familiarity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Langford et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jeon et al., 2010</a>). Work in dogs and primates further supports a familiarity effect for emotional contagion (<a href=\"#bib46\">Palagi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Campbell and de Waal, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Silva et al., 2012</a>)."

The empathic response involves activation of common neural networks for processing one\u2019s own and another\u2019s distress (<a href=\"#bib19\">Decety et al., 2012</a>). Some forms of empathy are primarily dependent on subcortical neural structures that are phylogenetically conserved across mammalian species (<a href=\"#bib18\">Decety and Svetlova, 2012</a>). Emotional contagion, a fundamental component of empathy resulting when the emotion of one individual evokes a matching emotional state in another individual (<a href=\"#bib50\">Preston and de Waal, 2002</a>), has been demonstrated in rodents (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Langford et al., 2006</a>). Thus, rodents, and mammals in general, may share a mechanism for mobilizing pro-social motivation in response to the distress of another individual. We would argue that a rodent form of empathy, as defined above, is the main motivation for the helping behavior observed in our studies. Moreover, the absence of door-opening for rats of unfamiliar strains likely reflects a reduced empathic arousal of the free rats in these conditions."

The selectivity with which rats engage in helping behavior is further evidence that releasing a trapped rat is an intentional social behavior, congruent with an empathic drive to help some rats, but not others. Yet, social experience can modify this behavior. We conclude that through social interactions, rats form affective bonds that elicit empathy and motivate helping. This motivation to help is extended to strangers of familiar strains, showing that rats form groups based on social experience. As is the case for humans (<a href=\"#bib61\">Xu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mathur et al., 2010</a>), rats base the bias for pro-social behavior on group membership. And as for humans, a diverse social experience was effective in mitigating such bias (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chiao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Elfenbein and Ambady, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Madsen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Telzer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zuo and Han, 2013</a>). Moreover, we have demonstrated that for rats, genetic similarity does not influence pro-social motivation. Rather, groups are socially defined. Whereas social bias is hard to overcome through cognitive effort (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dovidio et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Johnson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amodio et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Correll et al., 2007</a>), our results support the existence of at least one mechanism for altering group membership that does not require complex cognition."

Two SD pups were placed into each LE litter on either P0 or P1 (average 0.3 \u00b1 0.1). At this time, which corresponded to P0 of the LE litter (0.3 \u00b1 0.2), LE litters were culled to seven LE pups except for one litter which had only three LE pups. When the SD pups were on average 6.4 \u00b1 0.2 days old, one SD pup was removed, leaving a single male SD pup in the LE litter. Thus, most SD male pups (14/16) were exposed to one SD littermate for no more than 7 days (days when the pups\u2019 eyes were closed). However, in two cases, the SD pup in the LE litter died at a later date (P11, P12). In these cases, an SD male who had been removed from an LE litter 5 or 7 days before was then re-added to the LE litter. In sum, the average exposure to one or more SD pups was 7.2 \u00b1 0.4 days. The pup with the maximal exposure to at least one SD pup (11 days) was transferred when his eyes were open; this rat became the sole opener in the fostered+SD condition."

Data were not analyzed for five rats (four SD stranger, one LE cagemate) due to technical problems. Coded behaviors included anogenital sniffing, pinning, wrestling, and boxing. Coding was performed by four judges. There was an 84% agreement between judges. Boxing was the behavior that was selected to represent fighting, and analyzed. One rat (a non-opener in the SD cagemate condition) boxed on 95 occasions, a total that was more than five standard deviations over the mean for all rats tested. Additionally, this rat boxed on 10 of the 12 testing days, more than two standard deviations over the mean. This rat was therefore considered an outlier and was excluded from the boxing analysis."

The empirical facts are that rats, under some situations, will release another rat from an enclosure, however, that this is described as an act of \u2018prosocial empathy and with the aim of helping the other animal\u2019 which constitutes an explanatory hypothesis. The evidence in neither the previous paper nor this one convinces me that \u2018empathy and helping\u2019 are the most likely explanations. A lot more work is needed to tease out simpler explanations. For example, rats will work for the opportunity to engage another rat in a fight (<a href=\"#bib43\">Myer &amp; White, 1965</a>, Animal Behaviour, 13, 430-433) or in affiliative play (Humphreys &amp; Einon, 1981, Anim Behav, 29, 259-270), and in unfamiliar settings adult males will engage in a form of play that incorporates elements of aggression (Smith et al. 1999, Aggress Behav, 25, 141-152). Thus, a mixture of prosocial and anti-social motivations may be involved in the paradigm used in this paper. I am only half convinced that the release of a conspecific is unambiguously due to prosocial motivation. Even less convincing is that this releasing behavior arises from empathy. There are a large number of added cognitive processes that need to be in place for this to be the case. If the trapped rat is truly in discomfort in the enclosure, it is likely to be emitting many 22kHz calls (as recorded in this paper as alarm calls). While rats are attracted to 50kHz calls (Wohr &amp; Schwarting, 2007, PLOS ONE, 2, e1365), hearing 22-kHz induces freezing and avoidance (Brudzynski &amp; Chiu, 1995, Physiol Behav, 57, 1039-1044), so what is it about the \u201ctrapped rat\u201d that is attracting the performer? Empathy and helping may account for the performer\u2019s coming to the rescue, but to do so, it would need to somehow suppress its own defensive reaction to the alarm calls, as is implied by the authors\u2019 use of the words empathy and helping. But surely, this is just one of the many possible explanations for the releasing behavior. The authors need to revise the manuscript to reflect a more nuanced explication of the data in descriptive terms that are more neutral. Moreover, the concerns of alternative explanations described above need to be addressed."

This suggests that there is something about the paradigm that blocks social cues relevant for individual recognition.

For personally acquainted rats, immediate reward may not be needed because of the past association made between access to an individual and rewarding experiences. Similarly, by showing that unfamiliar rats with some cue identifier marking them as similar to cage mates are preferentially released, it may be simply a two-step association process. Release of a rat with a similar cue may occur because of a past association with social reward. Then, in the present experimental paradigm, the releasing rat may actually obtain the social reward, reinforcing the releasing behavior. That is, in this case the social reward may be important to release a rat that is not familiar, but resembles cage mates. The present findings may be accounted by simple association mechanisms, not requiring higher order processes involving empathy. You should discuss the role of association learning in interpreting your results."

The free rat\u2019s behavior was often reciprocated by the movements of the trapped rat, as the latter changed his position in the restrainer to face the free rat. The non-openers, on the other hand, spent less time around the restrainer and were more aggressive when the trapped rat exited the restrainer following half-way door-opening.

In fact, door-opening is hard, and rats have to work at it even when the restrainer contains coveted chocolate chips. Rats overcome their initial aversion of the arena center and demonstrate a specific movement pattern that involves circling the restrainer, biting and digging under it, and making multiple attempts to open the restrainer. Rats only cease such restrainer-focused activity after learning to open the restrainer. As the rats learn to open the door, the method for door-opening becomes uniform, and the initial freezing response to sound of the door falling over disappears. Rats did not show these behaviors when the restrainer was empty, contained a toy, or when a non-trapped cagemate was present. As such, general arousal is an unlikely and non-specific explanation for door-opening behavior in this paradigm, much like it would be an uninformative interpretation of a rat locating the underwater platform in the Morris water maze."

While they concluded that mice experience emotional contagion for cagemates but not for strangers, the data are open to other interpretations. When mice injected with acetic acid (to induce writhing, a visceral pain behavior) were tested with an uninjected stranger, they showed less pain behavior than did mice tested in isolation. While this result could stem from emotional contagion of the uninjected mouse\u2019s low pain state, the authors interpreted it as stemming from stress analgesia. Further, no comparisons were made between rats tested in the presence of a stranger that was either injected or not injected; comparisons were made only with isolated mice. The error bars in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> of Langford, et al.

Release of a rat with a similar cue may occur because of a past association with social reward. Then, in the present experimental paradigm, the releasing rat may actually obtain the social reward, reinforcing the releasing behavior. That is, in this case the social reward may be important to release a rat that is not familiar, but resembles cage mates.
