In budding yeast, various aging factors segregate to the aging (mother)-lineage, with poorly understood consequences. In this study, we show that yeast mother cells form a protein aggregate during early replicative aging that is maintained as a single, asymmetrically inherited deposit over the remaining lifespan. Surprisingly, deposit formation was not associated with stress or general decline in proteostasis. Rather, the deposit-containing cells displayed enhanced degradation of cytosolic proteasome substrates and unimpaired clearance of stress-induced protein aggregates. Deposit formation was dependent on Hsp42, which collected non-random client proteins of the Hsp104/Hsp70-refolding machinery, including the prion Sup35. Importantly, loss of Hsp42 resulted in symmetric inheritance of its constituents and prolonged the lifespan of the mother cell. Together, these data suggest that protein aggregation is an early aging-associated differentiation event in yeast, having a two-faceted role in organismal fitness."

This age-associated structure proved to be a different type of response than the protein aggregation that occurs during stress."

Reducing the levels of this enzyme prevented the deposit from forming and extended the lifespan of the mother cells. Thus, these findings suggest that mother cells collect harmful protein aggregates into a single deposit and prevent them from entering the daughter cells. Further work is needed to understand how the deposit is preferentially retained within the mother cell."

These studies have uncovered specific modes of cytosolic compartmentalization that take place when cells encounter proteotoxic stress. For example, cells stressed with heat respond by forming multiple protein aggregates (referred to as peripheral aggregates, stress foci, Q-bodies, or CytoQ) at the surface of the ER (<a href=\"#bib62\">Specht et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Spokoini et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Miller et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\"><a href=\"#bib76\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wallace et al., 2015</a>). These structures, hereafter referred as Q-bodies, contain acutely misfolded proteins that are sorted between the nuclear and cytoplasmic degradation/deposit sites by the Hook family proteins Btn2 and Cur1 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Malinovska et al., 2012</a>), and coalesce together by the aid of small heat shock proteins; Hsp42 in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib62\">Specht et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</a>), and Hsp16 in fission yeast (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coelho et al., 2014</a>). Simultaneously, Q-bodies are being rapidly resolved by the protein disaggregase Hsp104 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Parsell et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Specht et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Spokoini et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</a>), together with other heat shock responsive chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp82 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</a>). The formation of Q-bodies seems to aid stress survival, as the deletion of <i>HSP42</i> resulted in defective tolerance of prolonged heat stress (<a href=\"#bib17\">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</a>). The asymmetric inheritance of Q-bodies by the mother cells is promoted by the geometry of the bud neck (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>), tethering to mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>), and by actin cable-mediated retrograde transport, which is dependent of Hsp104 and Sir2 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Song et al., 2014</a>). Notably, Sir2 is also a key player in processes that underlie the asymmetric segregation of damaged mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib23\">Higuchi et al., 2013</a>) and the accumulation of extrachromosomal DNA circles (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kaeberlein et al., 1999</a>) to the aging mother cell.</a>"

This structure is regulated by the Upb3 deubiqutinase (<a href=\"#bib49\">Oling et al., 2014</a>), by proteosomal activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersson et al., 2013</a>) and by lipid droplets (<a href=\"#bib45\">Moldavski et al., 2015</a>), and it was also shown to appear during replicative aging (<a href=\"#bib49\">Oling et al., 2014</a>). The faithful inheritance of this structure by the mother cell is dependent on its association with the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib63\">Spokoini et al., 2012</a>). More recently, it was shown that the \u2018JUNQ\u2019 might actually reside inside the nucleus, and it was thus renamed as intranuclear quality control compartment, INQ (<a href=\"#bib44\">Miller et al., 2015</a>). The JUNQ/INQ assembly is dependent on Btn2-aggregase (<a href=\"#bib44\">Miller et al., 2015</a>), a protein also found to be involved in prion curing (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kryndushkin et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2012</a>).

Particularly, it is unclear why/how protein aggregates arise during aging, how are they segregated during cell division and, importantly, what is their consequence to the protein quality control of the aging cell, as well as to the aging process itself. To illuminate these aspects, we probed the role of protein aggregation during unperturbed replicative aging. Our findings indicate that protein aggregation is a prevalent and highly coordinated event of early aging and is not solely associated with proteostasis deterioration. Instead, we provide evidence that age-associated protein aggregation may initially benefit the cytosolic protein quality control, but eventually becomes involved with age-associated loss of fitness."

By employing the Mother Enrichment Program (MEP) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), we harvested cells of different age and first analyzed the localization of endogenous GFP-tagged protein-disaggregase Hsp104 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Parsell et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</a>), a broad sensor for protein aggregates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">Haslberger et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, we found many cells displaying an aggregate (typically a single bright Hsp104-labeled focus) and this portion increased in a progressive, age-dependent manner such that &gt;80% of cells that had undergone more than 6 divisions displayed such a structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Erjavec et al., 2007</a>). Co-localization analysis with Hsp104 demonstrated that the Hsp70 proteins Ssa1 and Ssa2, the small heat shock protein Hsp42, and the Hsp40 protein Ydj1 readily localized to these aggregates, the Hsp26 was found to be enriched in only 15% of Hsp104-labeled foci, while no accumulation of Hsp40 protein Sis1 or the Hsp90 protein Hsp82 was detected (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). Importantly, age-dependent appearance of these structures was also detected in diploid cells, in other strain backgrounds (W303), independently of the MEP procedure, and when different fluorophores where used for tagging Hsp104 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013H</a>), indicating that their formation represents a general, age-dependent phenomenon of budding yeast cells."

This showed that most mother cells started to form this aggregate already after budding three to four times (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, 390 min). The fastest growth phase of the aggregate took place during the first half an hour following its detection, after which the Hsp104 signal intensity increased only marginally (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). While the aggregates initially underwent occasional dissolution, they became stable within a few hours from nucleation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Pedigree analysis of aggregate inheritance in cells of different age showed that they faithfully segregated to the aging mother cell (98% of divisions), irrespective of its age (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,F</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). To further analyze the persistence and behavior of the deposits over the entire replicative life span of cells, we used a microscope-coupled microfluidic dissection platform (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This showed that the aggregate was efficiently maintained as one compartment, and whenever new foci emerged, they typically merged soon after with the pre-existing deposit. We quantified the number of Hsp104 foci (1 or &gt;1) and its post-nucleation stability in cells that were tracked for at least 10 divisions after the aggregate had appeared. These cells preferentially (&gt;80% of time) displayed only a single Hsp104 focus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013H</a>), which was very stable, typically persisting until the last divisions of the cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,I</a>). Moreover, this structure was largely non-dynamic, displaying limited exchange of Hsp104 with the cytoplasm, as determined by fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis in diploid cells that expressed one GFP- and one mCherry-tagged copy of <i>HSP104</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). We bleached and measured the recovery of the mCherry signal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>) and by fitting nine recovery curves, found that on average a large fraction (59%) of Hsp104 was immobile, while the mobile fraction displayed a half-time recovery rate of 8.9 s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). Together, these data show that a large majority of unstressed yeast cells develop a protein deposit early during replicative aging. This deposit displays limited exchange with the cytoplasm (assessed by Hsp104), is efficiently maintained as a single compartment, and is faithfully inherited by the aging mother cell."

Sup35 (eRF3) is a translation termination factor that can undergo stable amyloid-like prion conversion from non-prion [<i>psi\u2013</i>] to prion state [<i>PSI+</i>] (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chernoff et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ter-Avanesyan et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wickner, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Patino et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Paushkin et al., 1996</a>). Thus, we tested whether Sup35-GFP is targeted to the age-dependent aggregate and if the prion status plays a role in the targeting to and/or in the formation of the age-associated protein deposit. Importantly, Sup35-GFP clearly accumulated into Hsp104-mCherry-labeled age-associated protein deposit in 33% of [<i>PSI+</i>] cells that contained such a deposit, whereas no accumulation was detected in the non-prion [<i>psi</i>\u2212] cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). As expected, the formation of this bright Sup35 focus was age-dependent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), in line with earlier observations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Derdowski et al., 2010</a>), but interestingly the [<i>PSI+</i>] state did not have an overall effect on Hsp104-labeled deposit formation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Similarly, the elimination of the [<i>RNQ+</i>] prion by deleting <i>RNQ1</i> did not negatively influence the formation of the age-associated deposit (data not shown). Notably, time-lapse imaging showed that Sup35 was recruited into the pre-existing age-associated protein deposit (marked by Hsp104-mCherry). These Sup35-enriched age-associated protein deposits segregated asymmetrically towards the aging mother cell in 98% of mitoses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). These data provide evidence that the Hsp104-labeled focus is a <i>bona fide</i> deposit site for aggregating proteins, and that prion conversion of Sup35 promotes its gradual storage into the age-associated protein deposit, but does not potentiate its formation per se."

We first looked at the behavior of Q-bodies, which assemble in response to heat-stress. In stark contrast to the age-associated aggregates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,I</a>), Q-bodies induced upon heat stress (42\u00b0C, 30 min) were transient and readily solubilized after the removal of the stress factor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wallace et al., 2015</a>). Comparative analysis of the localization of different chaperone proteins between Q-bodies and the age-associated protein deposit showed that all markers of the age-associated protein deposit were also found to accumulate in Q-bodies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Conversely, we found chaperones such as Hsp82 and Btn2 localizing to Q-bodies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) albeit being excluded from the age-dependent protein deposit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Together, the reversible nature and the difference in associated chaperones demonstrate that the Q-bodies and age-associated protein deposits can be distinguished."

To this end, we induced the GAL-promoter-driven expression of the JUNQ/INQ marker, the unstable proteasome substrate human von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kaganovich et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Miller et al., 2015</a>), and monitored the accumulation of Hsp104-mCherry into the newly forming VHL-foci. VHL typically formed a single focus, which in 87% of the cases did not accumulate Hsp104-mCherry within 30 min after its appearance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>, N = 29). However, the VHL expression was often associated with overall increased Hsp104-mCherry expression over time, suggesting that its expression activates a stress response. Hence, we visualized the JUNQ/INQ without over-expression of exogenous substrates. To accomplish this, we used an Hsp82-GFP, Hsp104-mCherry expressing strain deleted of the <i>RPN4</i> gene, leading to increased burden of proteasomal substrates, due to decreased amount of functional proteasomes (<a href=\"#bib74\">Xie and Varshavsky, 2001</a>). Indeed, many of <i>rpn4</i>\u0394 cells displayed numerous Hsp82-Hsp104 double-positive Q-body-like puncta (data not shown). In addition, we found cells that displayed two puncta: a Hsp104-Hsp42 double-positive JUNQ-like deposit, and a Hsp104-positive, Hsp82-negative deposit that fills the criteria of the age-associated deposit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). To consolidate this further, we investigated the co-localization of the endogenous JUNQ/INQ marker Btn2 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Miller et al., 2015</a>) together with the age-associated protein deposit (Hsp104). This analysis showed that in 98.6% of the cases, Btn2 did not localize to the age-associated Hsp104-foci (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Moreover, from all thirty identified cells displaying endogenous Btn2 foci, we found only one case in which Hsp104 was enriched at this site (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>, N = 1268 cells). Together, these data suggest that the age-associated protein deposit and the JUNQ/INQ are discrete structures that may exist in parallel."

To visualize cells during IPOD appearance, we imaged Hsp104-mCherry-expressing cells together with the canonical IPOD marker, the galactose-inducible Rnq1-GFP (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kaganovich et al., 2008</a>), immediately after placing cells to galactose-containing media. This showed that the IPOD typically appeared as a single focus to which Hsp104 rapidly accumulated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,I</a>) (&gt;98% of Rnq1-foci displayed accumulation of Hsp104 within 30 min after their appearance, N = 53). However, by dissecting the Rnq1-GFP appearance dynamics in cell with a pre-existing age-associated protein deposit (marked by Hsp104-mCherry), we found that the aggregating Rnq1-GFP did not accumulate to the age-associated deposit (see white arrowhead in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), but rather it formed a new aggregate to which Hsp104 then strongly accumulated, while its intensity at the age-associated protein deposit declined (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). To rule out possible artifacts induced by Rnq1-GFP over-expression, we also looked at the co-localization between the age-associated protein deposit and GFP-tagged endogenous Rnq1 in its prion [<i>RNQ+</i>]-state. We analyzed altogether 117 Hsp104 foci-containing [<i>PIN+, PSI+</i>] cells and found that in 98.3% of the cases, Rnq1-GFP did not accumulate to this deposit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). Within this cohort, we found two cells with an Rnq1-GFP-aggregate, which was in both cases enriched with Hsp104-mCherry (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). However, both of the Rnq1-aggregate containing cells also displayed an additional Hsp104 focus to which Rnq1 had not accumulated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). Together with the results from the Rnq1 over-expression, these data suggest that Rnq1 aggregate is likely to represent a structure that is different from the majority of the age-associated protein deposits."

As shown before, young cells clear heat-induced protein aggregates (Q-bodies) rapidly after stress removal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

Surprisingly, when the cells without a prior aggregate encountered heat stress (i.e. conditions that induce proteotoxic stress), a substantially smaller portion of them (36.4%) displayed an aggregate at the end of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Similarly, there was a slight increase of cells without an aggregate in the stress-encountered cohort (17.7% vs 6.8%) among cells that displayed an age-associated deposit at the beginning of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). However, irrespectively of stress, cells with an age-associated deposit at the beginning of the experiment preferentially displayed a single deposit at the end of the experiment (non-stressed 82%, stress-experienced 79%) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). These results indicate that mild exposure to proteotoxic stress conditions counteract the formation of age-associated protein deposits and demonstrate that cells with an age-associated deposit prior to encountering the stress predominantly reverted back to this state. Altogether, these data indicate that despite forming a protein deposit, aged cells are still fit to coping with acute proteotoxic stress and suggest that the formation of the age-dependent protein deposit is not due to the overload of the general quality control machinery."

Pathological polyQ protein fragments have been shown to impair the UPS function both in yeast and mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bennett et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Park et al., 2013</a>), and UPS substrates have been shown to accumulate in aged cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersson et al., 2013</a>). On the other hand, stress-induced protein aggregates (Q-bodies) do not result from failed protein degradation, but may actually benefit the proteostasis of cells undergoing stress (<a href=\"#bib17\">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</a>). We therefore wanted to analyze the contribution of the age-associated deposit on the functionality of the UPS. In order to selectively measure the effect of the age-associated protein deposit on UPS function, we made use of the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nishimura et al., 2009</a>), which enabled us to measure the degradation rate of cytosolic (AID-GFP) and nuclear (AID-GFP-NLS) UPS substrates in vivo (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Cells co-expressing Hsp104-mCherry and AID-GFP were switched to auxin-containing media at the onset of imaging, and the GFP intensities were measured over time from neighboring cells containing or not an Hsp104-puncta. The normalized values were pooled and fitted with a non-linear one-phase decay function. Importantly, this showed that the decay rate of AID-GFP was significantly accelerated in cells with an age-associated deposit when compared to neighboring cells that did not contain an Hsp104-focus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>) (rate constant (K): 0.155 \u00b1 0.007 (with) vs 0.129 \u00b1 0.006 (without), p &lt; 0.01, N = 91 cells/category). However, no difference was detected in the decay rate of nuclear GFP between cells with or without an age-associated protein deposit (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>) (K: 0.075 \u00b1 0.004 (with) vs 0.079 \u00b1 0.005 (without), n.s.), demonstrating that the effect of the age-associated protein deposit on the UPS function is specific to the cytosolic compartment. Collectively, these results suggest that the age-associated deposit promotes cytosolic quality control by enabling more efficient clearance of degradation substrates."

                                "text": "Next, we wanted to understand what are the assembly principles of the age-associated deposit. Molecular chaperones generally recognize, refold, or sort aberrantly folded proteins, making them prime candidates to regulate the age-associated protein deposit assembly. Thus, we addressed the contribution of chaperones localizing to the age-associated protein deposit to its formation. Time-lapse microscopy showed that in 24 out of 25 cells, Hsp42 was at the age-associated protein deposit before Hsp104 and was the first protein we find to mark this structure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Ssa1 and Hsp104 were recruited subsequently, appearing concurrently up to 120 min after appearance of the Hsp42-focus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and data not shown). To identify the role of these chaperones in the assembly of the age-associated protein deposit, we investigated the consequences of their deletion. Interestingly, loss of the Hsp70 proteins Ssa1 and Ssa2, which act synergistically with the disaggregase Hsp104 in protein refolding (<a href=\"#bib18\">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2013</a>), resulted in rapid formation of the Hsp104 focus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>) and a similar, but milder effect was detected upon deletion of <i>HSP26.</i> In stark contrast, deletion of <i>HSP42</i> abolished age-associated protein deposit formation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>), which parallels to its function in Q-body assembly (<a href=\"#bib62\">Specht et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</a>). To probe the role of Hsp104 and Hsp42 further, we analyzed the consequences of their over-expression on age-associated protein deposit formation (monitored by endogenous Hsp104-GFP). Over-expression of Hsp42 caused precocious nucleation of age-associated protein deposit and promoted its growth (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>). On the contrary, a significantly smaller fraction of cells over-expressing Hsp104 contained an age-associated protein deposit and while age-associated deposits still occasionally formed, they were rapidly destabilized (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>). Collectively, these data suggest that these chaperones functionally oppose each other (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>): the Hsp104/Hsp70 proteins prevent age-associated protein deposit formation possibly by refolding cytoplasmic substrates, whereas Hsp42 coordinates the collection of these substrates from the cytoplasm into the age-associated protein deposit (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>)."

To accomplish this, we mated <i>hsp104\u0394 hsp42\u0394</i> double-mutant cells with wild-type (re-introducing both Hsp104 and Hsp42), <i>hsp104\u2206</i> single-mutant (to reintroduce only Hsp42), <i>hsp42\u0394</i> single-mutant (to reintroduce only Hsp104), or with the <i>hsp104 hsp42</i> double-mutant cells (reintroducing none of the chaperones) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). We monitored the deposit by imaging the fusing cells at 1-min intervals, using Ssa1-GFP as a reporter (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Importantly, simultaneous reintroduction of Hsp104 and Hsp42 was sufficient to clear the cytoplasm of Ssa1-GFP speckles already within 5 min (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>, no foci). In contrast, introducing Hsp42 alone resulted in rapid disappearance of cytoplasmic speckles with concurrent formation of a single Ssa1-GFP focus (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>, one focus). In contrary, reintroduction of only Hsp104 led to the slow and incomplete clearance of the Ssa-1 speckles, which was a reminiscent, but a milder phenotype as that observed upon conjugating the cell with <i>hsp104\u0394 hsp42\u0394</i> double-mutant partner (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, multiple foci). Collectively, this analysis supports the conclusion that Hsp42 functions to collect aggregates into the age-associated protein deposit structure, whereas Hsp104 functions to disaggregate/refold age-associated protein deposit destined substrates. In the context of the age-associated protein deposit cargo Sup35 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), it is interesting to note that Hsp42 over-expression promotes [<i>PSI+</i>] curing, while its deletion results in enhanced [<i>PSI+</i>] induction, further supporting its role as the depositor for the age-associated protein deposit (<a href=\"#bib15\">Duennwald et al., 2012</a>)."

In accordance to previous work (<a href=\"#bib16\">Erjavec et al., 2007</a>), mutant <i>hsp104\u2206</i> cells were short-lived compared to wild-type cells (21.5 vs 27 generations, p &lt; 0.001), supporting the idea that accelerated aggregate accumulation promotes aging. Further supporting this notion, deletion of <i>HSP42</i> extended the lifespan of the cells by more than 40% (39 generations, p &lt; 0.001). The lifespan of the <i>hsp104\u0394 hsp42\u0394</i> double-mutant cells was similar to that of the <i>hsp104\u0394</i> single-mutant cells (23 vs 21.5 generations, respectively, ns.) and significantly shorter than that of the wild-type (p &lt; 0.01) and <i>hsp42\u0394</i> mutant cells (p &lt; 0.001). The over-expression of <i>HSP42</i> had no effect on the lifespan (data not shown), suggesting that the wild-type levels of Hsp42 are sufficient to provide its maximal effects on life span, which is consistent with the appearance of the deposit early in life span in the wild-type cells. Together, these data imply that the Hsp104/Hsp70 system, which counteracts protein aggregation, is essential for longevity, while the Hsp42-dependent circuit promotes aging in the mother lineage, presumably by building the age-associated protein deposit and thereby establishing the asymmetric inheritance of age-associated protein aggregates."

Here, by using the budding yeast as a model for replicative aging, we identify an Hsp42-promoted and Hsp104/Hsp70-counteracted pathway that deposits age-associated protein aggregates and thereby ensures their biased segregation to the aging mother-lineage upon cell division (see model in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This might represent a common mechanism to drive asymmetric segregation of aberrant proteins in dividing cells, as stressed fission yeast cells utilize a similar Hsp16-dependent mechanism for asymmetric partitioning of misfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coelho et al., 2014</a>). Intriguingly, our data suggest that depositing age-associated protein aggregates to the mother cells might be a mixed blessing. On one hand, the age-associated deposit can promote spatial protein quality control (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4, 5</a>) and promote cell diversity as an asymmetrically dividing structure that may harbor protein conformation encoded epigenetic information, such as the prion fold of Sup35 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). At the same time, the long-term consequences of this pathway appear negative for the aging lineage (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Why the deposit-forming pathway ultimately becomes associated with age-dependent loss of fitness remains to be determined. In this regard, it will be of great importance to elucidate how age-associated deposit relates to other aging pathways, such as those influencing the function of mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib43\">McMurray and Gottschling, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">McFaline-Figueroa et al., 2011</a>), vacuoles (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</a>) and nuclear pores (<a href=\"#bib58\">Shcheprova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Webster et al., 2014</a>), and how the deposit localizes relative to these organelles and their components (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chong et al., 2015</a>)."

It is important to note, however, that our assays were conducted with relatively young cells that had recently acquired the protein deposit, and hence it is possible that UPS function starts to decline later during the aging process, as shown previously (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersson et al., 2013</a>). Curiously, the decline in proteostasis has been associated with protein aggregation pathologies such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's disease (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vilchez et al., 2014</a>). The decreased degradation of cytosolic UPS substrates in a polyQ disease model was found to be due to the sequestration of the Hsp40 protein Sis1 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Park et al., 2013</a>)\u2014a protein that was not associated with the age-associated deposit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). It is thus plausible that the presence of the deposit might, for example, lead to increased levels of available (substrate unbound) Sis1, thereby allowing more efficient nuclear import and degradation of cytosolic UPS substrates. Altogether, these data suggest that there is a need to better differentiate between pathophysiological protein aggregation and \u2018homeostatic\u2019 protein aggregation that takes place during physiological aging, of which the latter might initially help to coordinate chaperones and UPS factors involved in protein quality control. Related to this, the age-associated protein deposit did not clearly fill out the set criterion for any of the previously characterized cytosolic deposits, including Q-bodies, JUNQ/INQ, or IPOD, but rather seems to exist in parallel with the JUNQ and IPOD structures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)\u2014although, for example, the chaperones regulating these deposits were often shared between these structures. This favors the notion that pathological aggregation processes (mimicked e.g., by VHL and Rnq1 over-expression) can hijack endogenous proteostasis regulatory mechanisms, possibly underlying their harmful effects in cells (<a href=\"#bib51\">Park et al., 2013</a>). Altogether, these apparent differences between the stress-induced, pathological, and aging-associated protein aggregates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) demonstrates that protein aggregates are not all equal in their composition or in the way they are being recognized and dealt by the cell and reinforces the importance to discriminate between different aggregation models."

In this aspect, it is interesting to note that many of the long-lived asymmetrically retained proteins that accumulate to mother cells as they age (<a href=\"#bib65\">Thayer et al., 2014</a>) were among those localizing to the age-associated protein deposit (including Hsp104, Ssa1, Ssa2, and Hsp26). One example of an age-associated deposit resident protein was the prion-like Sup35. This storage rendered Sup35 to be inherited by the mother cells (unlike a prion, analogous to a mnemon (<a href=\"#bib5\">Caudron and Barral, 2013</a>)) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), which is consistent with the size-dependent transmission model of Sup35-aggregates (<a href=\"#bib14\">Derdowski et al., 2010</a>). However, aging does not enhance Sup35-dependent [<i>PSI+</i>] prion generation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Shewmaker and Wickner, 2006</a>). Together, these notions suggest that Sup35 cannot escape the age-associated deposit under normal growth conditions, perhaps owing to the rigid amyloid-like packing (<a href=\"#bib57\">Saibil et al., 2012</a>), being consistent with the durable and non-dynamic nature of these deposits. However, this notion may come with a caveat: we found that the age-associated deposit could be, at least temporarily, disassembled by the heat shock response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This suggests the captivating possibility that changes in the environment might trigger the spread from the age-associated deposit. For cells facing fluctuating environments in the wild, the strategy to stochastically store prion-like proteins in aged cells might prove beneficial, as it could allow stress-dependent spread of the prion conformers from a subpopulation of aged-cells to their daughters, promoting faster adaptation to the changing environment (<a href=\"#bib47\">Newby and Lindquist, 2013</a>)."
