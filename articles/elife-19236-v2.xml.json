NLGN2 is only at inhibitory synapses while NLGN3 is at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We found that NLGN3 function at inhibitory synapses in rat CA1 depends on the presence of NLGN2 and identified a domain in the extracellular region that accounted for this functional difference between NLGN2 and 3 specifically at inhibitory synapses. We further show that the presence of a cytoplasmic tail (c-tail) is indispensible, and identified two domains in the c-tail that are necessary for NLGN function at inhibitory synapses. These domains point to a gephyrin-dependent mechanism that is disrupted by an autism-associated mutation at R705 and a gephyrin-independent mechanism reliant on a putative phosphorylation site at S714. Our work highlights unique and separate roles for the extracellular and intracellular regions in specifying and carrying out NLGN function respectively."

NLGN2 is only at inhibitory synapses while NLGN3 is at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We found that NLGN3 function at inhibitory synapses in rat CA1 depends on the presence of NLGN2 and identified a domain in the extracellular region that accounted for this functional difference between NLGN2 and 3 specifically at inhibitory synapses. We further show that the presence of a cytoplasmic tail (c-tail) is indispensible, and identified two domains in the c-tail that are necessary for NLGN function at inhibitory synapses. These domains point to a gephyrin-dependent mechanism that is disrupted by an autism-associated mutation at R705 and a gephyrin-independent mechanism reliant on a putative phosphorylation site at S714. Our work highlights unique and separate roles for the extracellular and intracellular regions in specifying and carrying out NLGN function respectively."

Rats express three neuroligins (NLGN1-3): NLGN1 is expressed exclusively at excitatory synapses, NLGN2 is selectively present at inhibitory synapses, while NLGN3 is found at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<a href=\"#bib41\">Varoqueaux et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Budreck and Scheiffele, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Song et al., 1999</a>). NLGN2 and 3 share many previously identified domains both in their extracellular and intracellular regions. Despite the similarities between the two proteins, it is currently unknown whether they perform the same function at inhibitory synapses. One notable difference between NLGN2 and 3 resides in the extracellular region at splice site A which has previously been proposed to affect NLGN binding to its presynaptic neurexin partner (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ichtchenko et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chih et al., 2006</a>)."

In addition, it has been proposed that collybistin, a brain-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), helps regulate the localization of gephyrin, and that NLGN2 is a specific activator of collybistin via a direct interaction at the proline rich region in its cytoplasmic tail (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kins et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Soykan et al., 2014</a>).

We found that NLGN2 is a critical component of inhibitory synapses while NLGN3 function at inhibitory synapses depends on the presence of NLGN2. Further investigation expressing chimeric constructs of NLGN2 and 3 in isolation, using a microRNA targeting all three endogenously expressed NLGNs 1, 2, and 3, identified a previously uncharacterized domain in the extracellular region that accounted for this functional difference between NLGN2 and 3. Using a similar technique to study the importance of the intracellular region in NLGN function at inhibitory synapses, we found a critical requirement for the cytoplasmic tail and identified two key residues that are separately involved in gephyrin-dependent and gephyrin-independent mechanisms of NLGN function at inhibitory synapses. We further show that an autism-associated mutation inhibits the gephyrin-dependent pathway while a phosphorylation site is responsible for modulating the gephyrin-independent pathway. These findings identify new mechanisms for NLGN function, particularly at inhibitory synapses, and provide new avenues of study for elucidating the molecular mechanisms present at inhibitory synapses."

We biolistically transfected organotypic hippocampal slices with our constructs of interest and performed dual-whole cell recordings from CA1 neurons 7\u201310 days after transfection. Compared to a previously validated knockdown construct of NLGNs 1\u20133 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Shipman et al., 2011</a>) which reduces inhibitory synaptic transmission to about 50% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>) we found that while NLGN2 knockdown alone recapitulated the 50% decrease in inhibitory synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b and d</a>), NLGN3 knockdown alone had no effect on inhibitory synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c and d</a>). Furthermore, while overexpression of NLGN3 alone does enhance inhibitory synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e and g</a>), overexpression of NLGN3 with a NLGN2 knockdown construct fails to enhance inhibitory responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f and g</a>), suggesting that NLGN3 requires the presence of NLGN2 to function at inhibitory synapses. This is consistent with previous results showing no enhancement of inhibitory responses when NLGN3 was overexpressed on a NLGN1-3 knockdown background (<a href=\"#bib33\">Shipman et al., 2011</a>). Notably, NLGN3 overexpression on a NLGN2 knockdown background still enhanced excitatory responses similar to NLGN3 overexpression alone (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b,c and d</a>), suggesting our effects are specific for inhibitory synapses."

We first inserted a region of NLGN2 up to the 623rd amino acid that contains substantial differences between it and NLGN3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). Neither this chimeric construct (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b and h</a>) nor one adding back NLGN2 right before splice site A at the 180th amino acid (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c and h</a>) was able to enhance inhibitory currents. However, adding back NLGN2 up to the 52nd amino acid was able to potentiate inhibitory currents (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d and h</a>). Further refinement showed that transplanting just the domain between the 52nd and 180th amino acid of NLGN2 was able to fully confer NLGN2 ability to potentiate inhibitory currents onto NLGN3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e and h</a>). Since this domain encompassed the splice site A and a previously uncharacterized domain of the extracellular region, we wanted to know whether the splice site A or the uncharacterized domain alone was sufficient to confer NLGN2 function onto NLGN3. While expression of a chimeric construct containing the uncharacterized extracellular domain of NLGN2 between amino acids 52\u2013164 showed a modest enhancement of inhibitory currents (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f and h</a>), it was far less than the effect of the full length NLGN2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3h</a>). A chimera containing only the splice site A domain of NLGN2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g and h</a>) failed to enhance inhibitory responses. Importantly, all chimeric constructs, except NLGN3-180-NLGN2 which appears non-functional, that failed to potentiate inhibitory responses were still able to potentiate excitatory responses, indicating that they were functional (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). Together, this suggests that the splice site A domain alone does not account for the differences between NLGN2 and 3 function but that a previously uncharacterized adjacent domain is also required."

In experiments done on a reduced endogenous NLGN background, full-length NLGN1 was unable to enhance inhibitory responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b and d</a>), while a chimeric construct containing the NLGN2 extracellular region with a NLGN1 intracellular region was able to enhance inhibitory currents (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c and d</a>).

While overexpression of this truncation mutant on a wild-type background (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b and c</a>) enhanced inhibitory currents to a similar extent as full-length NLGN2 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a and c</a>), expression on a reduced endogenous NLGN background showed no potentiation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e and f</a>), indicating that a c-tail is required for proper NLGN function and further underlies the need to observe the effects of our mutant NLGNs on a reduced endogenous background due to the possibility of heterodimerization with endogenous NLGN.

First, it has previously been suggested that PSD-95 binds NLGN2, since it contains a PDZ domain (<a href=\"#bib21\">Irie et al., 1997</a>). Second, in addition to PSD-95, which is localized to excitatory synapses, S-SCAM is another protein that is localized to both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and can also interact via the NLGN2 PDZ domain (<a href=\"#bib43\">Woo et al., 2013</a>). To determine whether any of these interactions via the PDZ domain are important for NLGN2 function, we made a truncation mutant lacking the entire PDZ domain (NLGN2\u03944). We found that deleting the PDZ domain did not alter the function of NLGN2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a and d</a>). Proximal to the PDZ domain is the proline-rich region, which has been shown to be important for collybistin binding and enabling the recruitment of gephyrin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kins et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Soykan et al., 2014</a>).

The reigning model of NLGN function at inhibitory synapses purports that the interaction of gephyrin with NLGN2 via its gephyrin-binding domain enables the recruitment of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to the synapse (<a href=\"#bib8\">Choii and Ko, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014</a>). However, there have also been reports of gephyrin-independent mechanisms of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor enrichment at inhibitory synapses (<a href=\"#bib27\">L\u00e9vi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kneussel et al., 2001</a>). To determine whether the gephyrin-binding domain is critical for NLGN2 function, we employed a variety of methods to either disrupt or excise this region of interest. Surprisingly, we found that expression of NLGN2 with a phospho-mimic mutation previously shown to disrupt gephyrin binding (NLGN2 Y770A) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Giannone et al., 2013</a>), excision of the whole gephyrin-binding domain (NLGN2\u039455\u201369), or, most dramatically, truncation of the gephyrin-binding domain and everything downstream of it, including all known functional domains of the NLGN2 c-tail (NLGN2\u039469), all still displayed significant potentiation of inhibitory currents (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c and d</a>)."

To address this, we created a targeted knockdown construct for gephyrin that effectively knocks down more than 90% of gephyrin expression (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1a and b</a>). Expression of this construct reduced inhibitory currents to about 50%, similar to knockdown of all endogenous NLGNs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a and c</a>). Surprisingly, a NLGN2 truncation mutant lacking all known functional domains of the c-tail (NLGN2\u039469) coexpressed with our gephyrin and endogenous NLGN knockdown constructs was fully capable of enhancing inhibitory currents (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b and c</a>).

To determine whether this was the case, we made two more double mutants, combining either the autism mutation or phospho-null mutation with the point mutation in the gephyrin-binding domain that inhibits gephyrin binding (NLGN2-R705C-Y770A or NLGN2-S714A-Y770A).

Further analysis via expression of chimeric NLGN2/3 constructs on a reduced endogenous NLGN background revealed that this difference between NLGN2 and 3 function at inhibitory synapses is due to differences within a domain in the extracellular region corresponding to a site important for neurexin binding, as well as a proximal uncharacterized region."

Further refinement identified two distinct regions of the NLGN c-tail corresponding to gephyrin-dependent and gephyrin-independent mechanisms that enable proper function at inhibitory synapses. These results suggest that while the extracellular region is important for specifying function at an inhibitory or excitatory synapse, the intracellular region is critical for carrying out that function at both an inhibitory or excitatory synapse."

In our experimental system, we find that while knockdown of NLGN2 critically affects inhibitory transmission, knockdown of NLGN3 does not.

One possible explanation is that NLGN3 functions as an available mechanism to quickly enhance existing inhibitory synapses. Previous work looking at overexpression of NLGN2 or 3 in cerebral cortical neurons noticed that the majority of NLGN3 was not localized synaptically while the majority of NLGN2 was synaptically located (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fekete et al., 2015</a>). From this, we can surmise the presence of a readily available pool of NLGN3 located outside the synapse that could be recruited and associate with NLGN2 in response to induction of plasticity."

It suggests that NLGN3 is unable to bind to the corresponding neurexin partner at inhibitory synapses alone and that it needs to heterodimerize with NLGN2 in order to function. Previous work has already shown that different neurexin isoforms are expressed at different types of synapses, and that the neurexin isoform expressed at inhibitory synapses can bind to NLGN2 but not NLGN1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fuccillo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Futai et al., 2013</a>). Thus, it is possible that NLGN3, which seems to be able to bind to the neurexins at excitatory synapses by itself, needs to associate with NLGN2 in order to bind to the neurexins at an inhibitory synapse, and this special property of NLGN2 resides in a unique domain in its extracellular region that we have now identified. An alternative hypothesis, and one that does not necessarily require the presence of NLGN2/3 heteromers, is that there is another molecule in addition to neurexin that interacts within that domain of NLGN2 to stabilize the synapse and enable recruitment of NLGN3."

This is not surprising given that neurexin binding occurs at the extracellular region and that different neurexin isoforms are present preferentially at particular synapses. However, there could be other possible interactors that help define this functional specificity. Previous work has shown that NMDA receptors are able to bind to the extracellular region of NLGN1 but not NLGN2 or 3 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Budreck et al., 2013</a>). In addition, the presence of the B splice site insertion in NLGN1 enables it to enhance NMDA currents and promote LTP, and this site is notably absent in NLGN3 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Shipman and Nicoll, 2012a</a>). For inhibitory synapses, previous work has shown that MAM domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor proteins (MDGAs) are able to negatively regulate the function of NLGN2 through an interaction within their extracellular region (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pettem et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2013</a>). Also, there are multiple glycosylation sites in the extracellular region of the NLGNs and previous work has shown that glycosylation state can affect neurexin binding (<a href=\"#bib9\">Comoletti et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hoffman et al., 2004</a>). However, the analogous glycosylation sites initially found in NLGN1 are conserved among both NLGN2 and 3 within our critical domain, suggesting that they may not explain the difference we see in function. Previously identified cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds within the extracellular region are also conserved between NLGN2 and 3 within our critical domain (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hoffman et al., 2004</a>). Thus, it would be of interest to determine what molecular interactions are occurring at our critical extracellular domain to mediate NLGN function at inhibitory synapses both in baseline conditions and in response to plasticity."

These results are consistent with previous work showing that overexpression on a wild-type background of chimeric constructs containing NLGN1 extracellular linked to NLGN2 intracellular, or NLGN2 extracellular linked to NLGN1 intracellular, is fully capable of enhancing excitatory and inhibitory currents respectively (<a href=\"#bib15\">Futai et al., 2013</a>).

Thus, it would be of interest to determine whether phosphorylation of the S714 site affects dystrophin function."

However, our results indicate that phosphorylation at this site positively regulates NLGN2 function through a gephyrin-independent mechanism, since only the phospho-null form is able to block enhancement of inhibitory currents when paired with a mutation that blocks the gephyrin-dependent pathway (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This discrepancy might be explained by the previous study\u2019s use of non-neuronal cells for characterization of the interaction between gephryin and the phosphorylation state at that site. It remains to be determined what kinase phosphorylates this particular site and what molecules are recruited in response to phosphorylation to mediate gephyrin-independent NLGN2 function."

Previous characterization of this autism mutation at the analogous residue in NLGN3 showed no effect at inhibitory synapses (<a href=\"#bib12\">Etherton et al., 2011</a>). This is consistent with our results showing that NLGN2 with the R705C point mutation alone is fully capable of enhancing inhibitory transmission (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1c and d</a>). However, by combining the R705C mutation with the S714A mutation, we were able to uncover a deficit in NLGN function (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Similarly, it was only by combining the Y770A mutation with the S714A mutation, not the R705C mutation, that we were able to prevent NLGN2 from enhancing inhibitory currents, suggesting that the R705C mutation operates via a gephyrin-dependent pathway (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). These results underscore the additive effects of multiple point mutations, and highlight how disease phenotypes can be due to the interaction of a number of different factors. While the R705C mutation was shown to inhibit PKC-mediated interaction with NLGN4X at excitatory synapses, there is no analogous PKC phosphorylation site in NLGN2 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bemben et al., 2015</a>). Thus, it remains to be determined what molecules interact at this site and how this autism-associated mutation results in disruption of gephyrin binding to NLGN2."

The extracellular region is important for specifying function at a particular synapse while the intracellular region is important for carrying out the molecular mechanisms at either an excitatory or inhibitory synapse. We identify a domain in the extracellular region that is necessary and sufficient for specifying NLGN function at inhibitory synapses and elucidate both a gephyrin-dependent and gephyrin-independent mechanism for NLGN function at inhibitory synapses operating via intracellular interactions modulated by a phosphorylation site and an autism-associated mutation. These results advance our fundamental understanding of NLGN function at inhibitory synapses and provide multiple new avenues of study for further dissection of the various molecular interactors of the NLGNs, both extracellularly and intracellularly, and in normal and disease conditions."

The authors first find that NLGN2 but not NLGN3 is required for inhibitory synaptic transmission in cultured neurons. In follow-up experiments, the authors mainly use molecular replacement approaches to map out critical regions associated with NLGN2-dependent regulation of inhibitory transmission. The authors identify two domains in the extracellular region of NLGN2 (splice A site domain and an uncharacterized adjacent domain) that confer NLGN function at inhibitory synapses. Intracellularly, the authors find that a c-tail from NLGN1/2/3 is required for NLGN function at inhibitory synapses. Furthermore, they find that previously identified cytoplasmic domains including the PDZ-binding motif and gephyrin-binding domain are not required for NLGN2 function, but that an upstream region (\u03b4 117-133) and two residues within this region, one autism-related (R705) and the other phosphorylatable (S714), are important for NLGN2 function. Interestingly, the authors find that these residues together with a residue in the gephyrin-binding domain (Y770) are collectively important for NLGN2 function; combinations of residues both in the gephyrin-dependent and -independent pathways are important to fully support NLGN2 function. This is an interesting, well-performed and thorough study, and a well-written manuscript that is appropriate for <i>eLife</i>. The findings provide novel insight into the relevance and function of previously unidentified regions of Nlgn at inhibitory synapses."

Highlighted in red is our critical extracellular domain, which appears to be on the side of the neuroligin away from the neurexin-binding interface, suggesting that molecular partners other than neurexins underlie the ability of this domain to confer neuroligin function at inhibitory synapses. Indeed, there are a number of candidate molecules hypothesized to associate with NLGN2 [3] and it would be of interest for future studies to screen through possible interactors for binding to our identified domain. One caveat of this structural prediction is that the neurexin binding sites are based on the NLGN1/Neurexin1\u03b2 complex and it is possible that neurexins at inhibitory synapses bind to NLGN2 at a different site. In addition, we noticed that the published crystal structure of NLGN2 is missing 14 amino acids around and within the splice site A site, which could affect the true structure of the protein."
