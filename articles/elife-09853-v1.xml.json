When the stress is resolved, these stress granules dissolve, and protein production is resumed. But if the stress persists, the mRNA transcripts within the stress granules can be transferred to P bodies and broken down (<a href=\"#bib9\">Parker and Sheth, 2007</a>)."

But stress granules must still be able to readily dissolve once the stress is resolved so that their constituent parts can be reactivated."

Hexanediol interferes with weak hydrophobic (\u2018water-hating\u2019) interactions between molecules. Since liquid-like states involve weaker interactions than solid-like states, it was reasoned that liquid-like states would be disrupted by hexanediol but solid-state ones would not. Indeed, when yeast cells containing fluorescently tagged P bodies and stress granules were treated with hexanediol, the P bodies rapidly dissolved. Furthermore, this was reversible; the P bodies rapidly returned after the hexanediol was washed out."

These chemical and cell biological data suggest that the protein building blocks of P bodies interact weakly and move a lot, just like the molecules in a liquid."

To test this hypothesis, they engineered yeast cells to produce protein fragments that can assemble into a large spherical particle within living cells. They then genetically fused various misfolded proteins to these fragments, resulting in particles that had misfolded proteins on their surface. After a heat shock, stress granule proteins were rapidly recruited to the particles. However, stress granules did not form on particles that did not have misfolded proteins on their surface. This finding suggests that misfolded protein aggregates can act like a scaffold, allowing stress granule proteins to bind and recruit other constituent parts to coalesce into a mature stress granule."

Yeast stress granules form amorphous, unstructured solids, which are similar to aggregates of misfolded proteins. In several neurodegenerative diseases, insoluble deposits of proteins form structured assemblies with strong bonds, which are difficult to break down within cells. So-called \u2018amyloid deposits\u2019 are an example of this type of protein accumulation. These different states of matter are likely within a continuum, and the constituent components may undergo phase transitions to switch between different states under certain conditions. The color of the dashed lines indicates whether the states of matter on the continuum are considered healthy (\u201cphysiological\u201d; blue) or potentially diseased (\u201cpathological?\u201d; purple) in mammals (top) and yeast (bottom). It is important to note that amyloid states in yeast (and potentially in mammals) can also be used for normal physiological processes."

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are associated with aggregates that contain some of the RNA-binding proteins that are also found in stress granules. Perhaps, in these neurodegenerative diseases, the nerve cells are killed when healthy RNP granules (with weak interactions) switch to a disease-causing insoluble state (with stronger interactions) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ramaswami et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, Kroschwald et al. provide evidence that, in certain contexts, some proteins from P bodies and stress granules can form insoluble, immobile aggregates that are similar to those seen in these diseases."

In mammalian cells, what stops liquid-like stress granules and P bodies from fusing? What controls whether different RNP granules take on liquid-like or disordered solid-like states? These and other questions are still unresolved and are an area of intense interest (<a href=\"#bib3\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Kato et al., 2012</a>). Characterizing the biochemical structures of protein accumulations, such as RNP granules, is not only relevant to our fundamental understanding of how cells work, it may also help unravel the causes of several neurodegenerative diseases."
