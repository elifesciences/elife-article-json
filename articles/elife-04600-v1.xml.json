It is estimated that between 1 and 7% of the oceans are OMZs. These large swathes of water are lethal to animals that require oxygen, but they are hot-spots for microbes that can live on sulfur (<a href=\"#bib11\">Wright et al., 2012</a>).

From these samples, individual bacterial cells were sorted into tiny wells by a device called a flow cytometer.

Unfortunately, very little is known about the specificity of most marine viruses. Roux et al. identified five new types of viruses from the order <i>Caudovirales</i> and the family <i>Microviridae</i> that infect SUP05 bacteria. Although it is not known whether these viruses can infect other bacterial species, the identification of one host species is a major step forward. The <i>Microviridae</i> were almost always found in cells infected by <i>Caudovirales</i>, which indicates that they may cooperate in some way."

Similar SUP05-infecting viruses were consistently found in the OMZ over the three-year sampling period. Roux et al. were also able to observe evolution in the viruses, with new genes that appeared in the genomes of some of the viruses in the second sampling year being found in virtually all of the viruses by the third year."

The viruses that infect SUP05 in Saanich Inlet were rarely found in other ocean regions, even those adjacent to the Inlet, or in distant regions populated by similar SUP05 bacteria. This shows a surprisingly strict geographic restriction, despite regular seasonal mixing of Saanich Inlet with waters from the neighboring north eastern Pacific Ocean."

Bacterial DNA can be taken up by virus particles and shuttled to the next host bacterial cell, where it can be used to the new cell's advantage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Well-known examples of virus-mediated gene shuttling are the transfer of key photosynthesis genes between marine cyanobacteria, and the exchange of cholera toxin genes between different <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> strains (<a href=\"#bib3\">Faruque et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Lindell et al., 2004</a>). Genes for sulfur cycling were recently discovered in viruses associated with SUP05 from hydrothermal vents (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anantharaman et al., 2014</a>). Roux et al. also discovered genes for sulfur oxidation in the genomes of SUP05 viruses from Saanich Inlet. Thus, viruses might play a key role in altering core metabolism of SUP05, not only in the deep sea, but also in widespread OMZs. The sharing of bacterial genes by viruses may be a universal feature of natural microbial communities."

They do this by catalyzing key processes such as CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, organic matter recycling, conversion of nitrogen, and removal of toxic hydrogen sulfide (<a href=\"#bib2\">Falkowski et al., 2008</a>). To extend the analogy, viruses may be the mechanics who tinker with the efficiency of these engines by shuttling metabolic genes between bacterial host cells."
