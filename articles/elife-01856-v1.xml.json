We previously demonstrated that the transcription factor Nrf1/NFE2L1 mediates this homeostatic response in mammalian cells. We show here that Nrf1 is initially translocated into the lumen of the ER, but is rapidly and efficiently retrotranslocated to the cytosolic side of the membrane in a manner that depends on p97/VCP. Normally, retrotranslocated Nrf1 is degraded promptly by the proteasome and active species do not accumulate. However, in cells with compromised proteasomes, retrotranslocated Nrf1 escapes degradation and is cleaved N-terminal to Leu-104 to yield a fragment that is no longer tethered to the ER membrane. Importantly, this cleavage event is essential for Nrf1-dependent activation of proteasome gene expression upon proteasome inhibition. Our data uncover an unexpected role for p97 in activation of a transcription factor by relocalizing it from the ER lumen to the cytosol."

Other members of this family include p45 NF-E2, Nrf2, Nrf3, Bach1, and Bach2 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andrews et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Moi et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Oyake et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kobayashi et al., 1999</a>). The CNC-bZIP transcriptions factors heterodimerize with small Maf proteins (Maf F, Maf G, and Maf K) and preferentially bind to anti-oxidant response elements (AREs) present in the promoter region of their target genes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Motohashi et al., 2002</a>). The most studied member of the CNC-bZIP family is Nrf2, which in response to oxidative stress directs a transcriptional program that helps maintain cellular redox homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kensler et al., 2007</a>). Owing to their sequence similarity, Nrf1 was initially thought to have an overlapping function with Nrf2 in regulating antioxidant gene expression, but a growing body of emerging evidence contradicts this notion."

Consistent with our observation, TCF11 (a longer isoform of Nrf1 found only in humans) was subsequently reported to be a mediator of proteasome bounce-back response after proteasome inhibition in human cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Steffen et al., 2010</a>). Thus it appears that Nrf1 functions to combat proteotoxic stress caused by proteasome inhibition in mammals akin to transcription factors RPN4 in yeast (<a href=\"#bib35\">Xie and Varshavsky, 2001</a>) and Cnc-C in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Grimberg et al., 2011</a>). From the standpoint of cancer treatment, blockade of this bounce-back response may be a viable strategy to enhance the efficacy of proteasome inhibition therapy, given that Nrf1 depletion slows the rate of recovery of proteasome activity following transient application of a covalent proteasome inhibitor and results in enhanced proteasome inhibitor-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</a>). However, since the molecular requirements for Nrf1 activation have not been described, there remains no known mechanism to exploit this possibility."

What is known is that Nrf1 exists in two forms, p120 and p110, both of which are unstable and accumulate when the proteasome is inhibited (<a href=\"#bib25\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</a>). Whereas p120 is embedded in the ER membrane, p110 is soluble and can enter the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biswas and Chan, 2009</a>). However, the mechanism leading to the formation of these species is controversial, with one study pointing to proteolytic cleavage (<a href=\"#bib32\">Wang and Chan, 2006</a>) and another to differential glycosylation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>). We show here that, in striking contrast to other ER membrane-tethered transcription factors, the bulk of the Nrf1 polypeptide is inserted into the ER lumen. Activation of Nrf1 depends on p97/VCP-dependent transfer of the luminal segments of Nrf1 to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, followed by a novel proteolytic processing step."

This construct contains three consecutive copies of the Flag tag at the N-terminus of Nrf1 and an HA tag at the C-terminus. In the presence of MG132, regardless of the cell type used, we observed that although the anti-HA antibody was able to detect two different forms of Nrf1 (\u223c120 and \u223c110 kDa), the anti-Flag antibody was able to detect only the \u223c120 kDa form (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The simplest explanation for this observation is that Nrf1 p120 was cleaved somewhere close to the N-terminus to yield p110. To test this hypothesis and to identify the cleavage site, we overexpressed Nrf1<sup>3\u00d7Flag</sup> (Nrf1 with C-terminal triple Flag tag) in HEK-293T cells and immunopurified the protein and subjected the p120 and p110 forms to Edman degradation-based N-terminal sequencing.

Similar to inhibition of the proteasome, depletion of p97 leads to the strong accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated substrates (<a href=\"#bib33\">Wojcik et al., 2004</a>), underscoring its role in enabling degradation of a subset of the ubiquitinated proteome by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kolawa et al., 2013</a>). Given that cells depleted of p97 or treated with proteasome inhibitors accumulate both ubiquitinated proteins and Nrf1, we asked if p97 depletion was also sufficient to trigger the Nrf1-mediated bounce-back response. To this end, we made use of NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts that have been engineered to stably express a doxycycline-inducible form of an shRNA targeting p97. Unlike proteasome inhibition, depletion of p97 upon addition of doxycycline did not induce the bounce-back response (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; compare bars 1 and 3 for the PSM genes). By contrast, we observed that MG132-mediated bounce-back response was severely impaired when p97 was knocked-down (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; compare bars 3 and 4 for the PSM genes)."

Consistent with <a href=\"#bib29\">Steffen et al., 2010</a>, Nrf1 accumulated in cells depleted of p97 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, compare lanes 1 and 3). To address the key question of whether p97 contributes to processing of Nrf1, which is essential for its activation, we evaluated the forms of Nrf1 that accumulated in control vs p97-depleted cells treated with MG132. Whereas the control cells accumulated p110 (indicative of Nrf1 activation), this form was markedly absent in p97-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, compare lanes 2 and 4). This failure to process p120 is sufficient to account for the lack of bounce-back response in these cells. However, one concern was that due to the 3\u20134 days required for p97 knock-down, the p120 form we observed in p97-depleted cells could represent an aberrant dead-end species that only accumulated upon sustained deprivation of p97 activity, and was not a true intermediate in the processing pathway. To address this possibility, we made use of the recently described compound NMS-873, a reversible inhibitor of p97 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Magnaghi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Polucci et al., 2013</a>). Treatment of NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts or HEK-293-Nrf1<sup>3\u00d7Flag</sup> cells with NMS-873 led to a robust accumulation of p120 Nrf1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; lane 1), which was then efficiently converted to the p110 form with a half-life of \u223c30 min upon washout of NMS-873 in the presence of cycloheximide and MG132 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, lanes 2\u20136). The overproduced protein behaved similarly in HEK-293 cells, although the conversion of p120 to p110 was not as efficient as for the endogenous protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, compare left and right panels). Thus, our results are consistent with a model in which p97 controls not only the degradation of Nrf1, but also its processing to the active p110 form."

Given the role of p97 in Nrf1 processing and activation, we hypothesized that either p97 promotes processing of cytosolically-exposed Nrf1 and possibly its subsequent extraction from binding partners (as is the case for Spt23 and Mga2 in yeast, <a href=\"#bib11\">Hoppe et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Rape et al., 2001</a>), or p97 could be involved in re-positioning the TAD and DBD of Nrf1 from the luminal to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane to facilitate its processing. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed a series of protease protection experiments to assess the topology of Nrf1 under various conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). Regardless of p97 status (normal in the absence of doxycycline, or depleted in the presence of doxycycline, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), <sup>3\u00d7Flag</sup>Nrf1 was susceptible to Proteinase K (PK) digestion in the absence of detergent, implying that the N-terminus was oriented towards the cytosol at all times. Interestingly, however, the orientation of the C-terminus of Nrf1<sup>3\u00d7Flag</sup> showed a strong dependence on p97 status (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In mock-depleted cells, Nrf1<sup>3\u00d7Flag</sup> was largely susceptible to digestion by PK (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, compare lanes 4 and 5). In stark contrast, when p97 was depleted by the addition of doxycycline, Nrf1<sup>3\u00d7Flag</sup> was largely resistant to PK (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, compare lanes 7 and 8, or lanes 10 and 11). The different behaviors of <sup>3\u00d7Flag</sup>Nrf1 and Nrf1<sup>3\u00d7Flag</sup> and the failure to observe detectable trimming of Nrf1<sup>3\u00d7Flag</sup> are consistent with a topology wherein only a very small amino-terminal segment of newly-synthesized Nrf1 is exposed to the cytosol (amino acids 1\u20136), whereas the bulk of Nrf1 (amino acids 25\u2013742) remains in the lumen of the ER when the retrotranslocation activity of p97 is blocked. Interestingly, when we overexposed our blots, a small, protease-resistant pool of p120 was detectable at steady-state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, lanes 1 and 2). This pool quickly disappeared upon chasing with cycloheximide plus MG132 (lanes 4\u201311). We propose that retrotranslocation of p120 constitutively occurs at such a fast rate that, at steady-state, only a tiny fraction of luminal p120 can be detected unless retrotranslocation is blocked by depletion of p97 as in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>."

Nrf1 p120 that accumulated in cells treated with NMS-873 was sensitive to Endo H (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, compare lanes 1 and 2 or 5 and 6), whereas it became largely resistant to Endo H upon being chased in the presence of MG132 plus cycloheximide (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, compare lanes 3 and 4 or 7 and 8). This behavior is consistent with the protease protection data that indicated that the CTD of p120 flips from a luminal to a cytosolic orientation upon restoration of p97 activity. Notably, the cytosolically-oriented Nrf1 that accumulated upon restoration of p97 activity migrated more slowly than expected for Nrf1 that has been deglycosylated and proteolytically processed. This was particularly evident when the migration of the primary translation product for amino acids 104\u2013742 was compared to the species of Nrf1 that accumulated in cells subjected to various perturbations (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our data suggest that once it is retrotranslocated to the cytosol, Nrf1 is not only deglycosylated and proteolytically cleaved after Trp103, but it also gains one or more additional modifications, the nature of which remains unknown."

Prior work established that Nrf1 is initially integrated into the ER membrane but is turned over rapidly (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biswas and Chan, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</a>). Upon proteasome inhibition, it accumulates, migrates to the nucleus, and activates gene expression. In this work, we make several critical new observations about the biogenesis and processing of Nrf1 that allow us to formulate a model that explains how it becomes activated in response to proteasome inhibition. Specifically, we show that the domains of Nrf1 that are implicated in transcriptional activation are initially translocated into the lumen of the ER, but subsequently are retrotranslocated to the cytosolic side of the membrane in a manner that depends on the AAA ATPase p97/VCP. In unperturbed cells, the retrotranslocated Nrf1 is promptly degraded by the proteasome, resulting in a futile cycle of continuous synthesis, membrane insertion, retrotranslocation, and degradation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, left-hand side). However, in cells with compromised proteasome activity, some of the retrotranslocated Nrf1 escapes degradation and is cleaved on the N-terminal side of Leu-104 to yield a p110 fragment that is no longer tethered to the ER membrane and can migrate to the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, right-hand side). Importantly, this cleavage event is essential for Nrf1-dependent activation of proteasome gene expression upon inhibition of the proteasome."

It is then rapidly and efficiently retrotranslocated to the cytosol, where it is immediately degraded by the proteasome. In cells deficient in proteasome activity, degradation of cytosolically-exposed Nrf1 is retarded, allowing sufficient time for proteolytic processing of Nrf1 p120 to yield the active p110 form which can then migrate to the nucleus, heterodimerize with small Maf proteins, and activate transcription of its targets (e.g., PSM genes) by binding to antioxidant response elements (ARE). Note that the exact mechanism of the retrotranslocation step is unknown; what is shown in the figure reflects one possibility among several. Also, although the putative protease is depicted to be in the cytosol, it remains possible that it is in the ER membrane or lumen."

                        "text": "This model raises two important questions. First, what is the identity of the protease that clips p120 to yield p110? This remains unclear, but the available evidence rules out the most likely candidates. Cleavage by the site-1 and site-2 proteases involved in mobilization of SREBP appears unlikely, because CHO cell lines deficient in these activities (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rawson et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">1998</a>) were nonetheless able to accumulate p110 upon proteasome inhibition (R Rawson, personal communication). In addition, the proteasome, which cleaves Spt23 and Mga2 from the ER membrane in yeast (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hoppe et al., 2000</a>), appears to be dispensable for cleavage because we observed robust formation of p110 in two different cell lines with three different proteasome inhibitors across a wide range of concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, and data not shown). Finally, an inhibitor of ER-localized rhomboid protease(s) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Pierrat et al., 2011</a>) failed to impede the accumulation of p110 in cells treated with MG132 (data not shown). The second question is why does p110 not normally accumulate in unperturbed cells? Although it will be easier to address this question when the protease is in hand, a reasonable working hypothesis is that in unperturbed cells, p97-dependent retrotranslocation and proteasome-dependent degradation are so intimately coupled that there is no opportunity for the cleavage event to occur as Nrf1 is threaded from the membrane into the maw of the proteasome. However, when the proteasome is inhibited, Nrf1 accumulates on the cytosolic side of the membrane where it is susceptible to cleavage. Even if the protease occasionally intercedes before the proteasome can act and small amounts of p110 are generated, p110 is intrinsically unstable (<a href=\"#bib25\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</a>) and thus does not accumulate to substantial levels."

                        "text": "It should be immediately evident from the foregoing discussion how the activation of Nrf1 differs markedly from the activation of all other ER membrane-tethered transcription factors that have been studied to date, including SREBP, ATF6, OASIS, CREB-H, Spt23, and Mga2 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown and Goldstein, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hoppe et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ye et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kondo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>). In all of those cases, the precursor is inserted into the ER membrane such that the functional domains involved in transcription are displayed on the cytosolic side of the membrane. Cleavages in the cytosolic or intramembrane domains can therefore liberate soluble fragments that translocate to the nucleus. By contrast, since Nrf1 begins its life with its functional domains in the ER lumen, it must be retrotranslocated to the cytosol before processing can yield a functional fragment that can relocalize to the nucleus. However, because the p97-dependent retrotranslocation pathway traversed by Nrf1 is normally employed to clear misfolded proteins from the ER (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wolf and Stolz, 2012</a>), the inevitable consequence of Nrf1 piggybacking on this mechanism is that it is rapidly degraded by the proteasome as soon as it gains access to the cytosol. This precludes the accumulation of Nrf1 precursor on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, except under circumstances where there is insufficient proteasome activity to keep pace with the appearance of substrates."

Specifically, Zhang and Hayes proposed that p120 spans the ER membrane at least three times. They argued that turnover of this species is promoted by calpain, not the proteasome. p120 that escapes degradation was envisioned to remain stably integrated as a multispanning transmembrane protein until it is mobilized by an unknown signal, which triggers retrotranslocation of the luminal domains followed by their deglycosylation to yield active Nrf1. It was proposed that Nrf1 is later cleaved by the proteasome to yield lower molecular weight soluble species, but appearance of active Nrf1 precedes this cleavage event. However, the causal relationship between cleavage and activation could not be evaluated because the cleavage site(s) was not identified. Another key distinction is that Zhang and Hayes do not perform true chase experiments, and thus their data do not distinguish whether there is a precursor\u2013product relationship between the various Nrf1 species, or they arise from newly-synthesized Nrf1 following different biogenetic pathways. We do not understand the basis for the multiple discrepancies between our data and those of Zhang and Hayes."

Ricin, a plant toxin, and some bacterial toxins including cholera toxin, and shiga toxin likewise are retrotranslocated from the ER lumen to the cytosol, where they exert their biological functions (<a href=\"#bib12\">Inoue et al., 2011</a>). Another example is the Hepatitis E Virus capsid protein ORF2, which co-opts the ERAD machinery to gain access to the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib30\">Surjit et al., 2007</a>). To our knowledge, the only host protein that undergoes retrotranslocation from the ER but escapes degradation by the proteasome is calreticulin (<a href=\"#bib1\">Afshar et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gold et al., 2010</a>). Upon inhibition of the proteasome, presumably the entire complement of ERAD substrates mimics Nrf1 in that these proteins are retrotranslocated from the luminal to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane but are not degraded. Our observations provoke the question of whether some of these proteins, like Nrf1, exert novel functions upon their accumulation in the cytosol. An obvious question that emerges from our findings is why is Nrf1 regulated by such a baroque mechanism? Targeting Nrf1 to the ER may ensure that the basal level of Nrf1 activity is essentially zero in the absence of proteasome stress, due to the normally tight coupling between retrotranslocation and degradation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wolf and Stolz, 2012</a>). In cells that experience insufficient proteasome activity\u2014brought about either through environmental insults including proteasome or chaperone inhibitors produced by microbes, or through changes in gene expression\u2014accumulation of active Nrf1 can restore an adequate level of proteasome function."

Although inhibition of transcription factors with small molecules has proven difficult (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berg, 2008</a>), p97 is a druggable target (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chou et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Magnaghi et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, recent papers have reported enhanced killing of cancer cells when proteasome and p97 inhibitors are used in combination (<a href=\"#bib3\">Auner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chou et al., 2013</a>). It will be interesting to see whether blockade of the Nrf1-mediated bounce-back response through inhibition of p97 enhances the efficacy of proteasome inhibitor therapy in multiple myeloma or enables expansion of proteasome inhibitor therapy into new indications."

This requires a new membrane-spanning segment that the authors do not document. It seems equally likely that the NH2-terminal transmembrane helix is actually an uncleaved signal sequence that may never dissociate from the Sec61 translocation machinery. In this case the retrotranslocation may proceed by simply reversing the original membrane insertion mechanism so that the NH2- terminus would lead the way. If the authors agree they should consider modifying <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> to indicate this alternate mechanism for retrotranslocation."

Using a panel of suitably tagged mutant versions of Nrf1 and exploiting inhibitors of the AAA protein p97 and the proteasome, Radhakrishnan and colleagues provide compelling evidence that the bulk of Nrf1 (its C-terminus) is normally translocated into the lumen of the ER and then subject to proteasome-dependent ER-associated degradation (a process i.e. dependent on the activity of p97). Under conditions of diminished proteasome activity, the C-terminal portion of Nrf1 is untethered from its membrane anchor by a yet-to-be identified protease (that cleaves after Trp103) and finds its way to the nucleus where it serves to activate the transcription of genes encoding proteasome subunits."

The cleavage site of Nrf1 is precisely mapped and, crucially, the proposed unusual itinerary of Nrf1's C-terminal portion is confirmed by tracing the glycosylation status of the various trapped intermediates. Thus, this study will be of interest to a wide range of investigators."

Another possibility in addition to the one mentioned by the reviewer is that the N-terminal membrane anchor domain switches polarity during the retrotranslocation process. Given that our efforts at simplification appear to have backfired, what we have done is to modify the drawing to include a putative retrotranslocon, and then state explicitly in the text of the figure legend that the drawing reflects one possibility among several."

Although it is possible that the difference in mobility between these bands is due to conversion of a set of Asn residues to Asp, this seems unlikely given that the shift in MW is on the order of \u223c10 kD. Nevertheless, we now mention this possibility in the revised figure legend. It is possible that conversion of Asn to Asp results in activation of Nrf1, and in fact it has been suggested that this is the case (Zhang et al., 2009 Biochem J. 418, 293-310). In the Zhang study, they created a mutant in which 7 putative glycosylation sites were changed to aspartate. They reported enhanced activity for the mutant construct on a synthetic reporter, but only two-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> of their paper). But, there are a number of problems with their experiment. First of all, it was done by transient transfection and there is no information regarding the degree of overexpression. Second, the authors did not quantify their Western blot of the wild type and mutant constructs and it actually appears that there might be a bit more of the mutant protein, so it is unclear if increased transcription of the reporter gene is due to increased expression or increased specific activity. Finally, it was not established that each of the sites that is mutated is actually glycosylated. Even if the Zhang result is correct, a two-fold effect is of questionable significance. This experiment would need to be done under more physiological conditions to test properly the interesting hypothesis raised by the reviewer."

The most logical conclusion from this experiment is that the N-terminus faces the cytosol and the C-terminus faces the lumen (i.e., Nrf1 cannot be completely luminal). Regarding the point about the N-terminal transmembrane domain, we analyzed the Nrf1 sequence using the transmembrane domain prediction program TMpred (<a href=\"http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html\">http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html</a>), which indicated a strong transmembrane domain (amino acids 7 to 26)."

About half of the Nrf1 is carbonate extractable in cells depleted of p97 or treated with p97 inhibitor (by contrast, 100% of calnexin resists carbonate extraction in both cases). By contrast most of Nrf1 is carbonate extractable in cells treated with MG132, consistent with the idea that it has been dislocated from the ER membrane. In cells treated with both p97 and proteasome inhibitors, the p97-deficient phenotype is epistatic. Thus, while the protease protection suggests that essentially all Nrf1 molecules at a p97 block are transmembrane, the carbonate extraction suggests that roughly 50% of these transmembrane species remain in an aqueous compartment. The simplest resolution of this is to hypothesize that a significant fraction of full-length Nrf1 molecules remain associated with the translocon, reminiscent of what was recently suggested for Deg1-Sec62 chimeras (Rubenstein et al., 2012 J. Cell Biol. 197:761-773). Nailing this point down would require considerable more experimentation but would not alter our fundamental conclusion that the C-terminus of Nrf1 starts out its life in the ER lumen and p97 is required for its retrotranslocation, processing, and activity.
