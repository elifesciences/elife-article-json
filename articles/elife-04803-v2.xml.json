Although recent studies have suggested positive effects of electrical stimulation for memory enhancement, its potential targets remain largely unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that spatially targeted deep brain stimulation of ventromedial prefrontal cortex enhanced memory functions in a middle-aged rat model. Our results show that acute stimulation enhanced the short-, but not the long-term memory in the novel-object recognition task. Interestingly, after chronic high-frequency stimulation, both the short- and long-term memories were robustly improved in the novel-object recognition test and Morris water-maze spatial task compared to sham. Our results also demonstrated that chronic ventromedial prefrontal cortex high-frequency stimulation upregulated neurogenesis-associated genes along with enhanced hippocampal cell proliferation. Importantly, these memory behaviors were strongly correlated with the hippocampal neurogenesis. Overall, these findings suggest that chronic ventromedial prefrontal cortex high-frequency stimulation may serve as a novel effective therapeutic target for dementia-related disorders."

Although recent studies have suggested positive effects of electrical stimulation for memory enhancement, its potential targets remain largely unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that spatially targeted deep brain stimulation of ventromedial prefrontal cortex enhanced memory functions in a middle-aged rat model. Our results show that acute stimulation enhanced the short-, but not the long-term memory in the novel-object recognition task. Interestingly, after chronic high-frequency stimulation, both the short- and long-term memories were robustly improved in the novel-object recognition test and Morris water-maze spatial task compared to sham. Our results also demonstrated that chronic ventromedial prefrontal cortex high-frequency stimulation upregulated neurogenesis-associated genes along with enhanced hippocampal cell proliferation. Importantly, these memory behaviors were strongly correlated with the hippocampal neurogenesis. Overall, these findings suggest that chronic ventromedial prefrontal cortex high-frequency stimulation may serve as a novel effective therapeutic target for dementia-related disorders."

The electrodes were positioned to stimulate a region near the front of the brain called the \u2018ventromedial prefrontal cortex\u2019; this region is important for the formation and recall of memories. Liu et al. then gave the rats a series of memory tasks that tested their recall after 90 minutes (to test their short-term memory), and after 24 hours (to test long-term memory)."

However, more sustained stimulation of this region of the brain improved both the short-term and long-term memory of the rats. Furthermore, deep brain stimulation led to the formation of new brain cells in another region of the brain called the hippocampus, which is also involved in memory. The hippocampus had not been in direct contact with the electrodes so the increase in brain cells was due to its connections with the stimulated ventromedial prefrontal cortex."

It is usually caused by Alzheimer's disease and other age-related dementia. Its prevalence doubles from a low rate in 60\u201364 age group to 40\u201350% of those older than 85 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lobo et al., 2000</a>). Dementia is a progressive disease, which has a detrimental impact on the quality of life for patients. To date, pharmacological treatments for dementia have limited effects and there are no known treatments that cure or delay the progression of this memory impairment (<a href=\"#bib10\">Doody et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Salloway et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, a novel non-pharmacological approach such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently considered as an alternative treatment to reduce the symptomatic and progression of this memory deterioration (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hescham et al., 2013a</a>)."

In line with these developments, evidence from recent studies suggests that DBS might enhance memory functions when particular brain areas are stimulated (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hamani et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Laxton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Suthana et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hescham et al., 2013b</a>). Of particular interest, DBS of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex or the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) induced striking antidepressant activity in both patients and animal studies (<a href=\"#bib51\">Mayberg et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lozano et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hamani et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kennedy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Temel and Lim, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lim et al., 2015b</a>). Despite encouraging results, no studies have shown the putative role of vmPFC DBS in learning and memory performance. In the realm of cognitive function, there is empirical evidence indicating that vmPFC plays an important role in the formation, consolidation, and retrieval of memory, as well as reward and decision making (<a href=\"#bib50\">Maviel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Euston et al., 2012</a>). Based on the human imaging and rodent studies, the vmPFC was significantly activated during the recall of remote memory (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bontempi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Takashima et al., 2006a</a>, <a href=\"#bib70\">2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gais et al., 2007</a>), while its inactivation caused memory impairment when tested in the radial arm-maze (<a href=\"#bib50\">Maviel et al., 2004</a>), the Morris water-maze (MWM) (<a href=\"#bib73\">Teixeira et al., 2006</a>), and the contextual fear conditioning (<a href=\"#bib14\">Frankland et al., 2004</a>). In line with these studies, malfunctioning has also been reported in the hippocampus and the vmPFC (which received robust projections from the hippocampal formation) in early stages of Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and healthy aging-related memory impairments (<a href=\"#bib59\">Salat et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lindberg et al., 2012</a>)."

The use of this animal model was supported by previous data that showed aged-related deficits in both the memory and the hippocampal functioning (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rex et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kaczorowski and Disterhoft, 2009</a>). In acute DBS, animals were tested with either high- or low-frequency stimulation (HFS or LFS) at various amplitudes using the conventional novel-object recognition (NOR) test. Subsequently, another set of animals was used to assess the chronic stimulation effects on memory enhancement using the NOR and the MWM tests. For investigation of the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the effects of chronic stimulation on the molecular and cellular levels of hippocampal neurogenesis-related functions."

We next conducted electrical stimulation in this animal model of memory deficit, using HFS and LFS with various stimulation current intensities in the NOR test. Our results showed that HFS at 200 \u03bcA and LFS at 50, 200, and 400 \u03bcA significantly enhanced the memory functions in the short-, but not the long-term memory retention interval when compared to the sham. We next carried out chronic stimulation in this middle-aged rat model. We hypothesized that chronic stimulation would increase both the short- and long-term memory functions via a mechanism of enhanced hippocampal neuroplasticity. Previous studies have shown that memory deficits were partly due to the disruption of the hippocampal neuroplasticity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deupree et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Rex et al., 2005</a>). Therefore, our hypothesis was driven by findings that DBS in various brain targets increased BDNF level (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Ying et al., 2012</a>) and enhanced neurogenesis-related functions (<a href=\"#bib77\">Toda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kadar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Stone et al., 2011</a>) in the hippocampus.

Thus, after chronic stimulation, we found significant improvement in both the short- and long-term memories in the NOR test, as well as the spatial memory performances during the MWM task as compared to the sham."

Although these findings are consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hamani et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hescham et al., 2013b</a>), the mechanisms of the stimulation parameter dependency in regulation of memory functions remain largely obscure. Nonetheless, it is postulated that the neurons in the vmPFC are highly sensitive to specific stimulation settings for induction of either long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). This notion was highly supported by the findings in which the vmPFC synapses are potentially vulnerable to LTP or LTD strengthening after specific type of stimulation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Herry and Garcia, 2002</a>). It has been found that the prefrontal cortex neurons could undergo LTP with rapid and stable potentiation in the prelimbic synapses after high-frequency tetanic stimulation of the hippocampal CA1/subicular region (<a href=\"#bib36\">Laroche et al., 1990</a>). Such a LTP-like plasticity in the vmPFC after hippocampal HFS has been shown to be dependent on \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor, which indicates a crucial role for the synaptic potentiation in the hippocampal-vmPFC pathway in rapid memory consolidation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Laroche et al., 2000</a>). Although HFS and LFS at specific amplitudes were effective for memory enhancement, it is noteworthy that LFS induced negative effects on the anxiety-related behaviors (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lim et al., 2015b</a>). Furthermore, HFS of the vmPFC has been shown to reduce conditioned fear and enhance the extinction of aversive memory (<a href=\"#bib52\">Milad and Quirk, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Milad et al., 2004</a>), in contrast to LFS, which induced impairment in extinction of conditioned fear (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shehadi and Maroun, 2012</a>). Since previous studies of vmPFC HFS produced robust antidepressant-like behaviors (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lim et al., 2015a</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">2015b</a>), we therefore applied this stimulation parameter in the chronic stimulation experiment to test the hypothesis that it would restore the memory deficits for both the short- and long-term memory functions of the middle-aged rats."

Strikingly, we found a remarkable reversal of memory deficits in both the short- and long-term memory of the animals that received HFS prior to the NOR test as compared to the non-stimulated sham. Congruently, chronic vmPFC HFS significantly improved the spatial navigation performances when conducted in a hippocampal-dependent memory MWM test. In the present data, we clearly distinguished a role for the vmPFC in regulation of both the short- and long-term memory functions. In most studies, short-term memory is generally regarded as memory spanning from seconds to several minutes or hours, while long-term memory is usually last from hours to several days or longer (<a href=\"#bib55\">Nagai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Euston et al., 2012</a>). Albeit many studies have indicated that vmPFC is involved in the expression of long-term memory (<a href=\"#bib50\">Maviel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Teixeira et al., 2006</a>), there are also findings supporting that vmPFC is involved in consolidation and retrieval of recently acquired memories (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blum et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Leon et al., 2010</a>). Thus, it is likely that the vmPFC HFS potentiated the initial hippocampal encoding during the acquisition phase, which was then followed by enhanced retrieval during the short- and long-term memory recalls. Taken together, these findings further implicate a specific role for the vmPFC HFS in facilitation of rapid consolidation and retrieval of the short- and long-term memory processes in the hippocampus."

Interestingly, the effects of memory improvement by vmPFC HFS, as characterized by the increased novelty seeking in the NOR and MWM tasks, were highly associated with the stimulation effects on reduction in anxiety behavior. These results confirm previous findings that animals with lower anxiety or fear level displayed higher novelty seeking behavior, particularly in the elevated plus-maze and light\u2013dark box tests (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kabbaj et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Stead et al., 2006</a>). In consistent with the data found in the animal model of depression, rats undergoing chronic stress exhibited anxious and low exploratory behaviors (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lim et al., 2015b</a>), as well as impairment in spatial memory task performances (<a href=\"#bib7\">Conrad et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Beck and Luine, 1999</a>). Apparently, chronic stress produces pathological alterations on the molecular and morphological levels in the hippocampus that is involved in the regulation of both the spatial memory formation and emotional behaviors. Thus, our experiments found that the memory enhancement effect is likely to be accompanied by the vmPFC DBS-induced anxiolytic effects via the mechanisms of neurogenesis and dendritic remodeling in the hippocampal neurons."

Although there is no direct connection from vmPFC to the hippocampus, it is possible that the effects of vmPFC HFS on the hippocampal neural activity are mediated by a reciprocal bisynaptic pathway through the nucleus reunions or the lateral entorhinal cortex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burwell and Amaral, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Vertes et al., 2007</a>). Besides, the neural activity in the hippocampus could probably be activated by either antidromic or orthodromic stimulation that possibly achieved by a current spread from the vmPFC structure to the neighboring axon bundles\u2014the minor forceps of the corpus callosum (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lim et al., 2015b</a>). As a result, the hippocampal regions would eventually be activated for an induction of LTP to strengthen its synaptic plasticity for memory processes. Of particular interest, a tractography analysis by diffusion tensor imaging provides evidence for this structural connectivity that HFS of the subgenual cingulate gyrus (generally considered to be homologue of the rat vmPFC), showed connections to the medial frontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate, and the anterior medial temporal lobe (i.e., amygdala-hippocampus) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gutman et al., 2009</a>). The connections of the hippocampus and amygdala to the vmPFC have been previously investigated by anatomical and electrophysiological studies (<a href=\"#bib36\">Laroche et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jay and Witter, 1991</a>). It has been shown that the excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the amygdala and hippocampus were converged and interact in the vmPFC (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ishikawa and Nakamura, 2003</a>), implying that activation of the amygdalar-hippocampal neurons might be crucial for vmPFC neurons in memory regulation. More importantly, the electrophysiological studies have provided concrete evidence of functional interaction between the vmPFC and hippocampus in which their theta oscillations were highly synchronized as measured by both the spike-theta phase locking and local field potential coherence, during memory acquisition and retrieval in spatial tasks (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jones and Wilson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Siapas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Benchenane et al., 2010</a>). Based on this evidence, we suggested that the rapid encoding and retrieval of memory depend largely on the bidirectional regulation of synaptic connectivity between the vmPFC and hippocampus; while the disruption of its connection affect the learning and memory functions, which are commonly identified in patients suffering from dementia (<a href=\"#bib59\">Salat et al., 2001</a>)."

                        "text": "In line with our findings, HFS of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus and the entorhinal cortex has been demonstrated to increase neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib77\">Toda et al., 2008</a>) and memory functions, particularly spatial memory measured in the MWM (<a href=\"#bib68\">Stone et al., 2011</a>) and enhanced performance on a delayed non-matching to sample task (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hamani et al., 2011</a>). In this study, we found that vmPFC HFS induced upregulation of neurogenesis-associated genes with increased neural progenitors cells and dendritic spines in the DG of the hippocampus. In agreement with our previous microarray data (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kadar et al., 2011</a>), chronic HFS has been shown to modulate the hippocampal genes that involved in the proliferation and neurogenesis-related functions, as well as genes supporting for neural differentiation, migration and maturation. Although we observed no differences for the Timp1 (neuroprotection), Ccl2 (neural differentiation), and BDNF (synaptic plasticity) gene expression, there was an overall increase in their fold-change with approximately 1.2\u20132 fold after chronic vmPFC HFS. Notably, we found a strong induction of upregulation in the Angpt2 gene (4.8-fold) that promotes neuronal differentiation, migration and neuroprotection (<a href=\"#bib46\">Liu et al., 2009</a>), as well as NeuN/Rbfox3 gene (2-fold), which plays an essential role for neural progenitor cells differentiation and maturation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2013</a>). Further, our present observations were also supported by earlier works demonstrating that vmPFC HFS induced significant increase of BDNF and serotonin (5-HT) levels in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamani et al., 2012</a>). Recent studies have shown that the increase of 5-HT and BDNF expression in the hippocampus regulate synaptic plasticity, as well as cognitive and mood-related behaviors. It is well-known that both the 5-HT and BDNF promote neurogenesis by enhancing the synaptogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and survival particularly for memory acquisition and consolidation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gaspar et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lu and Chang, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pang et al., 2004</a>). Although no microdialysis data were provided with regard to the extracellular levels of 5-HT and BDNF after chronic vmPFC HFS, the increased neurogenesis effects as obtained from this study clearly indicate that its plausible mechanism is facilitated by the release of 5-HT and enhanced BDNF levels (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamani et al., 2012</a>). Importantly, the vmPFC HFS effects on the behavioral observation of improved memory functions and the neurogenesis have indicated that a strong synaptic network circuitry has been established within the DG for integration of new information and memory storage. In support of this notion, previous studies have demonstrated that the increased neurogenesis was highly associated with enhanced learning and memory, while its decrease caused memory impairment (<a href=\"#bib78\">van Praag et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shors et al., 2001</a>). Although the present study has identified the DBS-induced memory enhancement by neurogenesis, there is a possibility that these effects are mediated by other non-neurogenic mechanisms such as modulation of the neurotransmission (via acetylcholine, dopamine, 5-HT, etc), synaptic potentiation by the AMPA/NMDA receptor trafficking, and enhancement of the BDNF or CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) function (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Stern and Alberni, 2012</a>)."

Our correlation analysis of gene expression revealed that the Syn was strongly associated with the Nes and Dcx genes, suggesting that vmPFC HFS might possibly cause an alteration of increased dendritic synaptogenesis, particularly in the hippocampal DG where transcriptional process for Nes and Dcx genes occurs. Consistent with this interpretation, we have demonstrated the increase of dendritic spines in the Golgi-impregnated cells of the hippocampal DG. This observation was supported by a previous study which showed that electrical stimulation affected the axonal path in cultured Xenopus neurons that was mediated by elevation of both cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ming et al., 2001</a>).

The results were presented in box plots (with interquartile ranges and S.E.M) or mean \u00b1 S.E.M, unless otherwise indicated. Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was used to examine the data normality distribution. The behavior data were analyzed by either three-way or four-way ANOVA with repeated-measures, and Bonferroni post-hoc tests or independent sample <i>t</i>-test was used for detailed comparisons, as appropriate. Paired sample <i>t</i>-test was used to compare differences between the novel and familiar objects. The data for gene expression and morphological study were analyzed by either independent sample <i>t</i>-test or non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test, as appropriate. Pearson correlation coefficients with Bonferroni correction were calculated to examine the relationship between different variables related with the hippocampal neuroplasticity and the behavioral measures. All p-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant."

Forgetting should be apparent, conversely, in an increase in exploration of familiar stimuli, indicating the animal is treating the old stimuli as new. So, the results seems to be the opposite in that middle aged rats seem to treat the new stimuli as old rather than treat the old stimuli as new (also see also McTighe et al. Science 2010). Given that the animals must distribute their total exploration time between two stimuli, it seems might be too much to expect the animal to have high exploration times for both the new and old stimulus. Nevertheless, if the animals are forgetting, I would expect equal exploration of the old and new stimuli in test and in the original acquisition phase. Was this the case? They should show the acquisition phase data and compare scores between acquisition and test."

However, presumably many, many things also change following DBS, and establishing that the DBS-induced memory improvements depend on DBS would move the paper into the publishable realm I think. Asking whether preventing the DBS-induced neurogenesis increase prevents the memory improvements has been done in other studies (including the Stone et al. paper cited in the current manuscript), and doing such an experiment here would greatly strengthen this paper."

Second, more information is needed about how the stimulation was administered. For the acute stimulation study, it appears that stimulation was given for 30min before testing; does that mean the 30 minutes immediately before the habituation phase, or before each of the test phases? If it were the latter, stimulation would presumably affect retrieval processes and not encoding. Also, in the chronic stimulation study, it would be useful to know when the 1h of stimulation was given\u2014at a set time of day? When did the stimulation occur relative to behavioral testing? I also would like to see explained what the no-HFS and HFS conditions referred to- perhaps, this condition refers to whether the stimulation session occurred just before the behavioral testing? Given this was a behaviorally relevant variable it should be spelled out clearly. In short, I do not think the stimulation procedure was described in sufficient detail for replication. Perhaps a figure given the sequence of events of all behavioral procedures would be useful."

I did not see a lot of value in computing an entire correlation matrix on this dataset with a relatively low N. A more useful approach might be to simply explore hypothesis-driven correlations (e.g. neurogenesis measures with behavior). I also do not think it is useful to present correlations with both sham and stimulated animals. If the hypothesis is that the benefit of stimulation is related to the degree to which it enhances neurogenesis, there is no reason to include sham animals."

However, the animal model used here (12 month old rats) would seem to be a better model of healthy age-related memory decline. In fact, it seems the hypothesized mechanisms may not be effective when significant neural degeneration is present. Second, it may be worth discussing the relationship between mood effects of chronic ventromedial prefrontal cortex stimulation and the memory effect reported here. It may be that the stimulation has an effect on reducing anxiety, which increases novelty seeking and reduces thigmotaxic behavior in the Morris water maze, both which would enhance performance. The authors may want to consider whether the effect of ventromedial prefrontal stimulation on memory could be mediated by its anxiolytic action."

Although HFS and LFS at specific amplitudes were effective for memory enhancement, it is noteworthy that LFS induced negative effects on the anxiety-related behaviors (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lim et al. 2015b</a>). Furthermore, HFS of the vmPFC has been shown to reduce conditioned fear and enhance the extinction of aversive memory (Milad et al., 2002), whereas LFS induced impairment in extinction of conditioned fear (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shehadi and Maroun, 2012</a>). Since in previous studies, vmPFC HFS produced robust antidepressant-like behaviors (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lim et al., 2015a, b</a>), we applied this stimulation parameter (HFS) in the chronic stimulation experiment to test the hypothesis about its effect to restore the memory deficits for both the short- and long-term memory functions of the middle-aged rats. We have incorporated this comment into the Discussion (see second paragraph)."

Forgetting should be apparent, conversely, in an increase in exploration of familiar stimuli, indicating the animal is treating the old stimuli as new. So, the results seems to be the opposite in that middle aged rats seem to treat the new stimuli as old rather than treat the old stimuli as new (also see also McTighe et al. Science 2010). Given that the animals must distribute their total exploration time between two stimuli, it seems might be too much to expect the animal to have high exploration times for both the new and old stimulus. Nevertheless, if the animals are forgetting, I would expect equal exploration of the old and new stimuli in test and in the original acquisition phase. Was this the case?

(2010) was performed with rats having perirhinal cortex damage; while the animal model used in our study was considerably healthy with merely aged-related memory decline (intact brain). Indeed, human and animal studies have shown that damage to the perirhinal cortex could result in severe impairments in object recognition (Winters et al., 2010; Alvarev et al., 1994). In the study of McTighe, brain damage can produce impairments in visual recognition memory tasks not because the repeated object looks novel, but instead the novel object looks familiar. Concerning object information itself, the perirhinal cortex is considered to be the most crucial structure (Winters et al., 2008), and its damage would lead to a reorganization of the whole memory system particularly for specific type of memory and stimulus representations in different brain regions. It is, therefore, notable that the animal model used in our study for memory evaluation appears to be very different from the perirhinal cortex damage model."

The novel object recognition task has become a widely used model for the investigation into memory alterations. Albeit this task can be configured to measure the working memory and preference for novelty in rodents, validation of the results by other established behavioral tasks is advisable/obligatory. In this regard, we have conducted the Morris water maze test to further support our findings obtained from the novel object recognition test. Note. The results of both the novel object recognition and the Morris water maze tasks have consistently confirmed the memory enhancement effects of chronic vmPFC HFS. Thus, we can possibly rule out the probability of paradoxical false memory as found by McTighe et al. (2010) in the middle-aged animals."

Also, in the chronic stimulation study, it would be useful to know when the 1h of stimulation was given\u2014at a set time of day? When did the stimulation occur relative to behavioral testing?
