Here we examine the ecological consequences of cooperation by quantifying the fitness of cooperative (large groups) and non-cooperative (small groups) phenotypes in burying beetles (<i>Nicrophorus nepalensis</i>) along an elevational and temperature gradient. We experimentally created large and small groups along the gradient and manipulated interspecific competition with flies by heating carcasses. We show that cooperative groups performed as thermal generalists with similarly high breeding success at all temperatures and elevations, whereas non-cooperative groups performed as thermal specialists with higher breeding success only at intermediate temperatures and elevations. Studying the ecological consequences of cooperation may not only help us to understand why so many species of social insects have conquered the earth, but also to determine how climate change will affect the success of these and other social species, including our own."

Here we examine the ecological consequences of cooperation by quantifying the fitness of cooperative (large groups) and non-cooperative (small groups) phenotypes in burying beetles (<i>Nicrophorus nepalensis</i>) along an elevational and temperature gradient. We experimentally created large and small groups along the gradient and manipulated interspecific competition with flies by heating carcasses. We show that cooperative groups performed as thermal generalists with similarly high breeding success at all temperatures and elevations, whereas non-cooperative groups performed as thermal specialists with higher breeding success only at intermediate temperatures and elevations. Studying the ecological consequences of cooperation may not only help us to understand why so many species of social insects have conquered the earth, but also to determine how climate change will affect the success of these and other social species, including our own."

These insects find dead animals and then bury them to be eaten by their larvae. Burying beetles often fight each other to ensure that their own young get exclusive access to a food source. However, working together allows the beetles to bury a carcass before flies and other competitors discover it. Sun et al. compared how much the beetles cooperated at different elevations in the mountains of Taiwan. At each elevation the beetles faced different challenges: higher elevations were colder but had fewer flies, while lower elevations were warmer but had more flies."

Similar results were seen when Sun et al. created non-cooperative and cooperative groups of beetles at different elevations and provided each group with a rat carcass. Further experiments that used heaters to artificially warm the carcasses directly proved that cooperation among beetles was indeed encouraged by higher temperatures."

This shift from being a habitat specialist to generalist, and the subsequent ecological dominance by social species, has been termed the social conquest hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wilson, 2012</a>).

(<b>C</b>) In contrast, if cooperation is the best-of-a-bad-job strategy as a response to intraspecific challenges, the per capita reproductive success will be lower in groups than solitary pairs. This scenario often occurs when grouping occurs because of a lack of critical resources, such as when breeding territories are limited in many cooperatively breeding birds (<a href=\"#bib11\">Emlen, 1982</a>). Therefore, cooperative phenotypes do not necessarily have higher fitness than non-cooperative phenotypes in either poor or favorable environments.

To determine how temperature influences the degree of interspecific competition, which in turn mediates the cooperative and competitive strategies of <i>N. nepalensis</i>, we first documented the natural patterns of group size, cooperation, breeding success, and the degree of interspecific competition with flies along the elevational gradient. We then experimentally manipulated the group size of <i>N. nepalensis</i> and the degree of interspecific competition with flies to determine the mechanisms underlying the fitness patterns along the elevational gradient."

We found that the probability of breeding successfully for small and large groups varied along the elevational gradient such that large groups performed as thermal generalists with similar breeding success at all elevations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and air temperatures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), whereas small groups performed as thermal specialists with high breeding success only at intermediate elevations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and air temperatures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

We found no relationship between cooperative carcass processing and elevation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) or air temperature (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) in small groups. However, investment in cooperative carcass processing in large groups increased with decreasing elevation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and increasing air temperature (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), presumably because carcasses decompose more quickly at lower elevations (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) where fly abundance (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) and activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) is highest. Experimental exclusion of flies from carcasses confirmed that flies indeed enhance carcass decomposition rates; the mean dry weight of carcasses from which flies were excluded was more than two times heavier than carcasses for which flies had access (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Our data further showed that in large groups, per capita social conflict (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019) varied unimodally with a peak at intermediate elevations and air temperatures (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Importantly, only investment in cooperative carcass processing, and not social conflict, increased with increasing temperature in large groups. Together these results indicate that an individual\u2019s cooperative and competitive strategies are not influenced directly by temperature-dependent physiological constraints per se because higher ambient temperatures typically reduce the cost of activity for ectotherms (<a href=\"#bib2\">Angilletta, 2009</a>). Instead, our experiments suggest that an individual's cooperative and competitive strategies are influenced by temperature-mediated interspecific competition for resources, which increases with increasing temperature."

This generalist-specialist behavioral tradeoff along the elevational gradient in <i>N. nepalensis</i> is generated by the tension between an individual's share of the grouping benefit and the group's productivity. At low elevations where the pressure of interspecific competition with flies is highest, individuals in large groups were not only more cooperative at handling carcasses, but they also engaged in lower levels of social conflict, both of which enabled them to outcompete flies. As a consequence, cooperation enables burying beetles to expand their thermal niche to a warmer region where competitors are more abundant. In contrast, we found that the \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hardin, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Rankin et al., 2007</a>)\u2014that is the degree of social conflict was higher in large groups, which led to a reduction in breeding success relative to small groups\u2014occurred at intermediate elevations where the pressure of interspecific competition with flies was lower. At these intermediate elevations, non-cooperative groups have marginally higher breeding success than cooperative groups because intraspecific social conflict increased in the absence of interspecific conflict. Nonetheless, this within-group conflict has relatively little influence on the ecological dominance of burying beetles because breeding success is still relatively high in large groups in favorable environments, compared with those at elevations where environments are less favorable. We found a similar pattern in the natural populations (i.e., those without group size manipulations) where breeding success was highest at intermediate elevations even though there are many naturally occurring large groups in this region."

Preliminary support for this hypothesis comes from a recent comparative study of sponge-dwelling snapping shrimp (<i>Synalpheus</i> spp.), showing that eusocial species were more abundant and occupied a broader range of host sponge species than non-social sister species (<a href=\"#bib9\">Duffy and Macdonald, 2010</a>). We have shown experimentally in burying beetles that cooperative groups performed as thermal generalists, but non-cooperative groups performed as thermal specialists. Being cooperative enables burying beetles to extend their range to lower elevations where temperatures are warmer and where competitors are more abundant because individuals in large groups were more cooperative at handling carcasses, which enabled them to outcompete flies. Thus, cooperation allows burying beetles to expand their thermal niche into an environment from which they would otherwise be competitively excluded. Ultimately, studying the ecological consequences of cooperation may not only help us to understand why so many species of social insects have conquered the earth, but also to determine how climate change will affect the success of these and other social species, including our own."

If the random effects of repeated sampling of study sites were required, generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used. To test for the differences in the probability of breeding successfully between the two group sizes and carcass heating treatments along the elevational and temperature gradients, the outcome of breeding success (1 = Success, 0 = Failure) was fitted as a binomial response term. The environmental factors (elevation and daily minimum air temperature), group size treatments, and carcass heating treatments were fitted as covariates of interest. For the carcass heating treatments, the fitted value of the probability of breeding successfully was compared between heated carcass and control treatments. All statistic analyses were performed in the R statistical software package (<a href=\"#bib26\">R Core Team, 2012</a>)."

It includes both natural history elements documenting the actual situation along an elevation (and temperature) gradient followed by directed manipulative experiments. Overall the manuscript is well presented, but at some instances, clarity can be enhanced. The reviewers have also raised some concerns, especially relating to two figures that are central for the main conclusion of the study. In addition there is a concern about the statistical analysis to compare groups. This is explained below. The response to the concerns will be crucial in the decision on your manuscript."

Correlation data shows that burying beetle groups are larger at low elevation/high temperature, which may be due to factors like carcasses decomposing more quickly or that there are more beetles at low elevation. In addition you performed impressive field manipulations where you vary the group size (small and large) of semi natural beetle groups and follow how they perform across the gradient. This shows differences between the two groups sizes in success along the gradient."

Overall these are interesting data and an interesting idea but there are some concerns. The manipulation experiment data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5 and 6</a> are key to concluding that the large groups are more tolerant to environmental variation than small groups. However, looking at <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, it looks like the large groups are doing worse in the intermediate values (and p=0.06 for the chi squared suggests that this is likely real). But you have drawn a straight line through things for large groups and one reviewer is worried that this is missing an important detail: small groups are best at intermediate temperatures and elevations. Moving to <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, it is argued that there is no trend for the small groups but also, there are no small groups at all at low elevations/high temperature and if one removed the large groups at these points, one would lose the correlation for large groups I expect (was this done?). Without this, it is hard to know whether the correlation is a direct effect or the large groups or just down to the fact that small groups cannot make it for the key ranges where temperature effects would be seen."

However, this is not the way to analyse this. Rather, these should be tested against each other to compare them.

This is a bit different to what you are suggesting: the large groups are no longer generalist but the species range is likely increased by being able to make large or small groups when needed. So, dependent on the additional analyses, the narrative of the paper would need to be reworked in response to this."

As you suggest, we now also interpret the result more clearly as small groups have marginally higher reproductive success than large groups at intermediate temperatures and elevations. These changes make the results fit even better in our generalist-specialist trade-off framework (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). That is, small groups perform as thermal specialists and do best at intermediate temperatures and elevations, whereas as large groups are generalists with wider thermal niches, but lower reproductive success. The detailed discussion of this result is now added in the text and the figure legend of new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>."

Without this, it is hard to know whether the correlation is a direct effect or the large groups or just down to the fact that small groups cannot make it for the key ranges where temperature effects would be seen</i>."

We actually did perform our experiments for both large and small groups at all elevations, but since all small group breeding attempts failed at low elevations, we did not show these data in the original figure. In other words, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> originally only showed total investment of <i>successful</i> breeding events to avoid the potential complications of including failed breeding events. We now realize this may have been misleading, so we have added the investment data of failed breeding events to the figure and analyses. Importantly, adding these points has no effect on the analyses, and the original pattern of investment for small groups remains the same (in new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."
