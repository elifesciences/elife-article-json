By analyzing intracranial electrode data from humans, we demonstrate for the first time that there are prominent beta (15\u201335 Hz) and theta (4\u20138 Hz) oscillations in both the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the DLPFC during REM sleep. We further show that these theta and beta activities in the ACC and the DLPFC, two relatively distant but reciprocally connected regions, are coherent. These findings suggest that, counter to current prevailing thought, the DLPFC is active during REM sleep and likely interacting with other areas. Since the DLPFC and the ACC are implicated in memory and emotional regulation, and the ACC has motor areas and is thought to be important for error detection, the dialogue between these two areas could play a role in the regulation of emotions and in procedural motor and emotional memory consolidation."

During one of these stages, our eyes move rapidly from side to side behind our closed eyelids. This movement gives this stage its name: rapid eye movement sleep, or REM sleep for short. Most other muscles are paralyzed during REM sleep, possibly to prevent us from acting out the vivid dreams that also occur during this stage of sleep. But despite the distinctive properties of REM sleep, relatively little is known about about why we need it or how the brain generates it."

This is because previous studies had shown that this region, which is involved in decision-making and planning, was relatively inactive during REM sleep. Indeed it had been suggested that the limited activity of the DLPFC subregion might be responsible for the often bizarre and illogical nature of our dreams. Instead, Vijayan et al. showed that the ACC and the DLPFC coordinate their activity during REM sleep. The next challenge is to find out whether this dual activity helps support other roles that the two regions share in common, such as the strengthening of memories and the regulation of emotions."

We have a relatively detailed picture of the spatio-temporal pattern of activity that occurs during NREM sleep, and this has allowed detailed hypotheses concerning the circuits and mechanisms at play during NREM sleep. For example, the transfer of memories from the hippocampus to the neocortex during NREM sleep is thought to be mediated by the coordination of oscillatory activity seen in the local field potentials, namely by the interaction of hippocampal ripples (80\u2013250 Hz) with neocortical spindles (11\u201316 Hz) and slow (&lt;1\u00a0Hz) oscillations (<a href=\"#bib5\">Battaglia et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ji and Wilson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lee and Wilson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">M\u00f6lle et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sirota et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Staresina et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</a>)."

This may be due in part to the fact that the activity patterns seen during REM sleep do not easily lend themselves to neat description like those seen during NREM sleep. During REM sleep field potential recordings are not dominated by prominent oscillations; rather they are irregular and of low voltage, similar to recordings during awake behavior (<a href=\"#bib64\">Rasch and Born, 2013</a>). During awake activity, the\u00a0oscillations that emerge during cognitive tasks are thought to play a key role in aspects of cognition such as working memory and communication between brain areas (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ba\u015far et al., 2001</a>). Thus a detailed understanding of the spatio-temporal characteristics of emergent oscillations during REM sleep may shed light on which areas are interacting during REM sleep, how dreams are generated, and how some of the putative functions of REM sleep, such as memory consolidation, are carried out. Little is known about oscillatory activity during REM sleep with the notable exceptions of theta oscillations in the rodent hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Louie and Wilson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Montgomery et al., 2008</a>), gamma oscillations in the neocortex (<a href=\"#bib16\">Castro et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Llin\u00e1s and Ribary, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Steriade et al., 1996</a>), and pontine-geniculate-occipital (PGO) waves (<a href=\"#bib14\">Calvo and Fern\u00e1ndez-Guardiola, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Datta, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Datta and Hobson, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Steriade et al., 1989</a>)."

Imaging studies suggest that activity patterns in certain regions of the frontal cortices are markedly different during REM sleep than during awake activity, with some areas (e.g., the anterior cingulate (ACC)) being more active and some (e.g., the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)) less active (<a href=\"#bib9\">Braun et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Maquet et al., 1996</a>). These differences in activity patterns suggest that important REM sleep processes might be taking place in the frontal cortices (<a href=\"#bib9\">Braun et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Maquet et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Muzur et al., 2002</a>). At a functional level, REM sleep has been hypothesized to play a role in such processes as the consolidation of emotional and procedural motor memories (<a href=\"#bib31\">Fischer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gilson et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nishida et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Nitsche et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Rasch and Born, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Smith, 2001</a>) and the regulation of emotions. Since the frontal cortices serve memory, emotional regulation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Buhle et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Etkin et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2006</a>), and motor functions, they make good candidate areas for the mediation of procedural motor memory and emotional memory consolidation as well as emotional regulation during REM sleep."

The prominent oscillatory activity in the DLPFC is especially surprising since current thinking, based on imaging studies (<a href=\"#bib9\">Braun et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Maquet et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Muzur et al., 2002</a>), is that the DLPFC is relatively quiet during REM sleep in comparison with awake periods, and it has been postulated that the relative quiescence of this \u2018executive\u2019 structure might be responsible for the bizarre nature of our dreams. We also show the novel result that beta bursts and theta oscillations during REM sleep are coherent between the DLPFC and the ACC, two relatively distant structures. This finding is especially intriguing since the ACC and the DLPFC are both implicated in memory and emotional processing (<a href=\"#bib11\">Buhle et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Etkin et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</a>), and the ACC is interconnected with motor areas (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bates and Goldman-Rakic, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Dum and Strick, 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hatanaka et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Morecraft and Van Hoesen, 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Picard and Strick, 1996</a>), is thought to have motor regions itself (<a href=\"#bib61\">Paus, 2001</a>), and is thought to be important in error detection (<a href=\"#bib39\">Holroyd and Yeung, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Paus, 2001</a>). Therefore the rhythmic activity we observe in the frontal cortices may play a role in some of the hypothesized functions of REM sleep such as the consolidation of emotional and procedural motor memories and the regulation of emotions."

Many of the frontal electrodes showed a marked change in the spectral content during REM sleep onset. In particular, REM sleep onset resulted in the appearance of prominent bursts of beta activity. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a> depicts the spectrogram from an exemplar frontal electrode. The activity shown here and in other figures (and the activity included in all analyses) was detected by bipolar derivations from two neighboring contacts; thus this physiological activity is relatively local in nature. As REM sleep begins there is a change in the spectral content; beta bursts appear and then occur throughout the REM sleep episode. To get an impression of the global occurrence of the beta bursts we identified periods during which there was a\u00a0prominent beta activity on a given electrode (three standard deviations above the median power and at least two cycles in length). This analysis suggested that the beta bursts indeed tended to occur in the frontal electrodes after onset and throughout the REM sleep episode, but not in temporal lobe electrode leads (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). Furthermore, the beta bursts seemed to occur in close proximity to one another across the frontal electrodes."

We looked at the cross-covariance in theta power and in beta power between all electrode pairs that showed significant coherence. Both theta and beta cross-covariance functions showed a central peak. The theta peak occurred at approximately 22 ms (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>), suggesting that theta activity on average tended to occur first in the DLPFC. The peak of the beta cross-covariance function occurred very close to zero but was slightly positive (2 ms, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>), suggesting that the beta activity occurred nearly simultaneously in the DLPFC and ACC but that on average it occurred very slightly earlier in the DLPFC. To further examine the difference in the timing of the occurrence of beta and theta activity, we quantified the asymmetry in the cross-covariance function in the \u2212100 to 100 ms window. In particular, we subtracted the area under the cross-covariance curve from \u2212100 to 0 ms from that of 0 to 100 ms. A positive value would suggest that DLPFC activity preceded ACC activity and a negative value the opposite.

The relative silence of the DLPFC, a structure thought to be important for executive functions, during REM sleep has been postulated to underlie the often bizarre and illogical nature of our dreams (<a href=\"#bib57\">Muzur et al., 2002</a>). Our data suggest that the DLPFC is actually active during REM sleep, since it displays significant theta and beta oscillations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b,d</a>). Furthermore, the DLPFC might be communicating with other structures, since theta and beta bands in the DLPFC are coherent with those in the ACC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a\u2013c</a>). The DLPFC might communicate directly with the ACC or it might be driven by a third structure that coordinates the activity of the DLPFC with other areas. A discrepancy in brain activity levels assessed by PET studies and electrophysiological techniques has also occurred with respect to sleep spindles (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dang-Vu et al., 2010</a>). PET studies suggest that the thalamus is relatively quiet during sleep spindles (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hofle et al., 1997</a>), while a large body of animal studies shows that spindles are generated precisely by thalamocortical interactions (<a href=\"#bib51\">McCormick and Bal, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Steriade et al., 1985</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">1987</a>). One possibility is that during REM sleep the periods outside the oscillatory events may show less overall neural activity than is seen during awake periods, so that PET measurements, which average over relatively large periods of time (on the order of minutes), indicate that the DLPFC is less active during REM sleep than during quiet awake periods. Another possibility is that the oscillatory activity observed in the DLPFC during REM sleep may manifest under relatively inhibited conditions; the connectivity patterns between the DLPFC and the ACC suggest that the DLPFC may receive more inhibition from the ACC under the physiological conditions of REM sleep in comparison with awake conditions (<a href=\"#bib52\">Medalla and Barbas, 2012</a>)."

There is a large body of evidence suggesting that NREM sleep may play an important role in memory consolidation (<a href=\"#bib64\">Rasch and Born, 2013</a>), but whether or not REM sleep also plays a role in memory consolidation remains unclear (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dudai et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Rasch and Born, 2013</a>). Some animal and human studies suggest that REM sleep plays a role in procedural and emotional memory consolidation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Fischer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Fu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Karni et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Louie and Wilson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nishida et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Nitsche et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Popa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Smith, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Wagner et al., 2001</a>), but other studies, especially human studies, do not corroborate these findings and suggest that REM sleep may be important for other cognitive functions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Walker et al., 2002b</a>) such as emotional regulation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baran et al., 2012</a>) while stage 2 NREM sleep may be more important for the consolidation of procedural memories (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mantua et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tamaki et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Walker et al., 2002a</a>). Whether these differential findings arise because of the different natures of the tasks, differences across species, or simply because REM sleep plays little or no role in memory consolidation remains to be determined. Below we discuss our findings in light of previously known facts about the structures and oscillations at play during REM sleep. Our discussion is driven by the perspective that REM oscillatory activity may play an important role in memory, and we put forward hypotheses for how the rhythmic activity that we have observed during REM sleep could serve a role in memory consolidation, but we note that rhythmic activity during REM sleep could serve some other function or possibly no function at all."

It is possible that this activity could be important in the\u00a0procedural motor memory consolidation since the ACC is interconnected with motor areas (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bates and Goldman-Rakic, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Dum and Strick, 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hatanaka et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Morecraft and Van Hoesen, 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Picard and Strick, 1996</a>), is thought to have motor regions itself (<a href=\"#bib61\">Paus, 2001</a>), and is thought to be important in error detection (<a href=\"#bib39\">Holroyd and Yeung, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Paus, 2001</a>). In humans, beta activity has been shown to follow PGO waves during REM sleep in the subthalamic nucleus of the basal ganglia, so the beta activity observed in our work could result from the transmission of the PGO-related beta activity from the basal ganglia (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amzica and Steriade, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Mendoza et al., 2009</a>); pontine wave density has been correlated with sleep-related improvements in memory tasks and the expression of plasticity-related genes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Datta, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Datta et al., 2008</a>). This possibility is in line with our findings that the observed beta activity tends to manifest at approximately the same time in both the ACC and the DLPFC, suggesting that it may originate from a subcortical source. Such a scenario leads to the intriguing possibility that PGO waves may trigger an evaluation of a motor plan by a dialogue occurring via the beta band channel (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

Furthermore, emotional information from the limbic system conveyed via the theta band may bias the processing and consolidation of procedural memories with high emotional content (<a href=\"#bib63\">Popa et al., 2010</a>). Note that many different functions have been attributed to the ACC (<a href=\"#bib61\">Paus, 2001</a>), so its activation during REM sleep does not necessarily mean that it serves the function of emotional or procedural memory consolidation during REM sleep."

Recent intracranial studies in humans have begun to provide us with more detailed information about the physiological processes underlying REM sleep (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andrillon et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cantero et al., 2003</a>). These studies have primarily focused on REM-related processes (both at the unit and LFP level) in the medial temporal lobe. We build on this knowledge base by examining the spatio-temporal characteristics of rhythmic activity in the frontal cortices. Here we have made significant inroads toward better understanding the physiological processes underlying REM sleep through the discovery of a frontal beta-theta network and we hypothesize that this network might mediate memory consolidation during REM sleep."

The preoperative MRI scan was used to generate a 3D rendering of the brain using FreeSurfer (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dale et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Fischl et al., 1999</a>); this rendering was placed in a 3D coordinate system (RAS). The postoperative CT scan was then coregistered with the 3D rendering, thus providing a RAS coordinate for each electrode (<a href=\"#bib27\">Dykstra et al., 2012</a>). FreeSurfer automatically generated subcortical and cortical parcellations with anatomical labels using the Desikan-Killiany Atlas (<a href=\"#bib23\">Desikan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Fischl et al., 2002</a>). Using these parcellations and the RAS coordinates, we determined the anatomical location of each electrode contact. We considered contacts labeled as being in rostral middle frontal by FreeSurfer according to the Desikan-Killiany Atlas (<a href=\"#bib23\">Desikan et al., 2006</a>) to be in the DLPFC. We considered the inferior frontal gyrus to consist of contacts labeled as parstriangularis, parsopercularis, and parsorbitalis. Contacts labeled as middle temporal gyrus were categorized as such. The locations of the contacts were also determined by a trained neurologist. In the case of the midline contacts (in relation to this paper, the anterior cingulate contacts) there was some discrepancy between the locations of the contacts determined by the neurologist and by the FreeSurfer labeling scheme. The locations determined by the neurologist were used. We employed bipolar derivations using two abutting contacts so that we could be sure the activity being analyzed was relatively local in nature. Only electrode derivations for which both contacts had labels within the same defined region and such that at least one of the contacts was in the gray matter were used for subsequent analyses. We did not use bipolar derivations with contacts in two different regions since in these cases it was not possible to determine from which region the activity originated. In addition, contacts that showed epileptic activity were eliminated from subsequent analyses (36 bipolar derivations were eliminated by this criterion). After eliminating bipolar derivations based on these criteria, we were left with 15 bipolar derivations in the DLPFC, 22 in the ACC, 12 in the inferior frontal gyrus, and 19 in the medial temporal gyrus. In other defined regions, there were relatively few bipolar derivations that met the criteria for inclusion in our analyses, and not all subjects had bipolar derivations in these regions."

Those periods specified as REM sleep were subsequently examined by eye and verified as REM sleep epochs by experienced sleep scorers (SSC). We also verified via video recordings that the patients were asleep during identified REM sleep epochs. The subjects spent 73.18%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.82% (SEM) of the time in NREM sleep, 16.23%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.85% of the time in REM sleep, and 10.59%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.78% of the time awake after sleep onset (WASO), with a total sleep time of 378.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.67 min. We used conservative measures in identifying REM periods for the purposes of further analysis. We chose relatively long (&gt;5 min) REM periods that were not interrupted by non-REM sleep stages. Furthermore, we selected the beginning and the end of each REM period (first and last 10 s) such that there were no other stages or transition stages present. Thus, our results were not influenced by the\u00a0spectral content from any other sleep stages."

See <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> for power spectrum comparisons between NREM sleep and REM sleep, which demonstrate that the spectral content is very different between the two states and show the clear distinction between spindling activity during NREM sleep and beta activity during REM sleep. Note that all subjects had at least 21 min of REM sleep, resulting in over 125 10 s windows per electrode in each subject. Only electrode contacts showing significant power in the band of interest were used for subsequent analysis. However, this resulted in the elimination of very few electrodes. In the DLPFC no electrodes were eliminated from the theta band analyses (0/15) and two electrodes were eliminated from the beta band analyses (2/15). In the ACC no electrodes were eliminated from the beta band analyses (0/22) and three electrodes were eliminated from the theta band analyses (3/22)."

We estimated the coherence during REM sleep by first dividing all REM sessions of a subject into 2 s windows. All 2 s intervals of data were included in a single coherence calculation for that subject using the coherence formula employed by Chronux (see equations 7.77 and 7.80 in <a href=\"#bib53\">Mitra and Bokil, 2008</a>). The time-bandwidth was set such that the coherence estimate for the center band (e.g., 6 Hz for theta) integrated the entire band of interest. We assessed significance using two methods: by using the confidence level provided by Chronux and by doing Monte Carlo simulations (2000 shuffles). The confidence level provided by Chronux is based on the\u00a0distribution of the statistic (i.e., the coherence measure) given the null hypothesis of zero coherence (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bokil et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brillinger, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Jarvis and Mitra, 2001</a>).

Based on neuroimaging studies, the authors have thought of the ACC and DLPFC as regions of specific interest, which may be inversely active to each other (ACC high, DLPFC low) during REM. However, the results of the present study suggest that both areas are active, with significant beta and theta activity that occurs coherently between the regions. The authors suggest that the results indicate a neurological basis for a proposed function of sleep in memory consolidation."

First, data from frontal electrodes were reduced to electrodes in the ACC and DLPFC, because beta and theta activity was most prominent in these regions. From these electrodes, only those were used for coherence analysis that showed a significant power increase in the frequency bands of interest. From these electrode pairs, only those that showed significant coherence were used for the subsequent power cross-covariance analysis, which was moreover only calculated for time windows with power in the top 25% within each REM episode. All of this data-driven sub-selection potentially bias the results towards positive findings. As an example, using only electrode pairs with high coherence for power cross-covariance can be problematic since these two measures are not independent (Lachaux, Rodriguez et al. 1999, Srinath and Ray 2014). Furthermore, it is not clear how much data (sleep epochs, electrodes, time windows, electrode pairs) were discarded in absolute numbers in each step (only the ratios of electrodes used based on power and coherence are given in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). Please report the number of recorded electrodes per subject including their location. Please give an idea on how many data were finally used at each analysis step. Coherence was tested for statistically significant differences using Monte Carlo simulations as well as the \"confidence level provided by Chronux\" (subsection \u201cCoherence Estimates\u201d). What is this confidence level based on? Apparently, both methods yielded \"the same results\" (Paragraph six Results section). Please elaborate, are the results indeed fully identical? How did the authors deal with the influence of the number of trials for the estimation of coherence (e.g. Maris, Schoffelen, Fries 2007). Was the number of observations equalized across REM sleep periods? In the subsection \u201cCoherence Estimates\u201d, the calculation of coherence reads as if the coherence between two electrodes was calculated for each window and then was averaged. However, since calculating coherence for a single trial (here: 2-s time window) will always result in a coherence of 1 (as well as their average), I assume that the cross-spectra were calculated for each time window and then used to calculate coherence (not \"average coherence\") across time windows. Please clarify the procedure\u201d."

Keeping in mind that the present data contain no cognitive measures, it cannot be stated \"These findings, in conjunction with previous work on REM sleep, suggest a system for the consolidation of memories during REM sleep.\" It seems that much of the discussion is focused on just this point \u2013 the REM role in consolidation \u2013 which I see no clear support for in the present data.

The presence of rhythmic activity in the DLPFC is surprising since imaging studies suggest that the DLPFC is relatively inactive during REM sleep; the relative inactivity of the DLPFC, a structure thought to be important for executive functions, has been argued to be the cause of the illogical nature of our dreams. The high-frequency activity generated in the DLPFC presumably requires a fair amount of metabolic energy. Furthermore, the ACC and the DLPFC, two relatively distant structures, were coherent in the theta and beta bands, suggesting that the DLPFC may in fact be interacting with other structures during REM sleep. There was also significant theta and beta activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> supplement in manuscript). There were not enough bipolar derivations to determine the nature of the rhythmic activity present in other frontal structures; note that the placement of the electrodes was determined strictly by clinical criteria. The frontal structures that were examined exhibited more high frequency activity (i.e., beta) than did temporal areas (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> in the manuscript). The difference in power between the various frontal structures cannot be determined using our data since power depends on the geometric arrangement of the neuronal process relative to a given electrode as well as the proximity to the electrode."

These selection criteria resulted in 15 bipolar derivations in the DLPFC, 22 in the ACC, and 12 in the inferior frontal gyrus.

Note that in the instance of the inferior frontal gyrus, for which we provide data in the figure supplements, the standard error traces indicate that theta and beta activities are variable across the subjects."
