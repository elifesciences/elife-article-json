A prominent organizing principle is that the rostral/caudal axis of the lateral PFC (LPFC) is structured according to the level of cognitive control (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fuster, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Koechlin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Koechlin and Summerfield, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Badre, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Badre and D'Esposito, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">2009</a>). Mounting evidence from neuroimaging and lesion studies suggests that progressively rostral areas perform progressively higher levels of cognitive control through processing increasingly abstract representations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Koechlin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Badre, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Badre and D'Esposito, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Koechlin and Jubault, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nee and Brown, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Koechlin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bahlmann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Azuar et al., 2014</a>). This organization enables the LPFC to control behavior across multiple timescales including adapting actions according to the prevailing context, and aligning behaviors with longer-term goals and plans (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fuster, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">2008</a>)."

To this end, it has been proposed that the LPFC is organized hierarchically such that more rostral areas exert asymmetrically greater influence upon more caudal areas (<a href=\"#bib6\">Badre and D'Esposito, 2009</a>). Hierarchical processing confers substantial computational efficiency and flexibility (<a href=\"#bib11\">Botvinick and Weinstein, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Duncan, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Solway et al., 2014</a>), and such processing in the LPFC could explain the massive propensity for higher-level cognition found in primates. However, data demonstrating functional hierarchical processing in the LPFC have been limited (<a href=\"#bib39\">Koechlin et al., 2003</a>) and controversial (<a href=\"#bib55\">Reynolds et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Crittenden and Duncan, 2014</a>). Furthermore, no data have linked hierarchical processing to its surmised cognitive advantages. Finally, although it has been widely assumed that the rostral-most areas of LPFC are situated at the apex of the hierarchy (<a href=\"#bib40\">Koechlin and Summerfield, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Badre and D'Esposito, 2009</a>), recent data call this assumption into question (<a href=\"#bib33\">Goulas et al., 2014</a>). Hence, understanding whether and how hierarchical processing occurs in the LPFC remains a significant barrier to modeling goal-directed cognition."

To do so, we devised a paradigm to engage the entire LPFC by orthogonally manipulating demands on stimulus domain and cognitive control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We began by confirming that the rostral/caudal axis of the LPFC operates according to abstraction principles by examining gradients of stimulus domain-generality/specificity, and temporal control over action. Next, we modeled interactions among LPFC sub-regions to examine whether and how cognitive control demands elicit asymmetrical influences indicative of hierarchical processing. Finally, we aimed to establish whether individual differences in hierarchical interactions predict trait-measured higher-level cognitive functioning, consistent with the presumed computational advantage of hierarchical processing."

Participants began each block of trials by performing a basic sequencing task which required the determination of whether the current stimulus followed the previous stimulus in a trace of the points of a star (spatial task) or in the word 'tablet' (verbal task) with the appropriate stimulus feature cued by color. Hence, a critical aspect of the basic task was <i>Feature Control</i> \u2013 selecting the appropriate stimulus feature to integrate into ongoing cognition. These demands recruit caudal dorsal and ventral LPFC for spatial and verbal selection, respectively (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nee et al., 2013</a>).

Here, we focus on the effects of cognitive control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), while the effects of <i>Stimulus Domain</i> are depicted in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The main effect of <i>Temporal Control</i> produced activations across the rostral-most aspects of the LPFC, mostly within the lateral frontopolar cortex (FPl; putative area 10) and mid-middle frontal gyrus (MFG; putative area 9/46), also spanning orbitofrontal cortex and pars orbitalis ventrally, through rostral-MFG (rMFG; putative area 46) laterally, up to the superior frontal gyrus dorsally. Previous studies have suggested that rostral LPFC is engaged as difficulty is increased regardless of functional demands (<a href=\"#bib16\">Crittenden and Duncan, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fedorenko et al., 2013</a>). Notably, the main effect of <i>Temporal Control</i> in the present design includes both the easiest condition (<i>Delay</i>) and hardest condition (<i>Dual</i>). The rostral LPFC was engaged considering each condition in isolation (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), ruling out the possibility that activations in this area are attributable to difficulty. The main effect of <i>Contextual Control</i> was most pronounced in mid-lateral areas including the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS; putative area 45 or 9/46v) extending into pars triangularis ventrally, and the caudal middle frontal gyrus (cMFG; putative area 8Ar or 9/46d) dorsally. Significant effects extended both rostrally into the FPl, and caudally into the inferior frontal junction (IFJ; putative area 44 or 8Av) and pars opercularis ventrally, and the caudal superior frontal sulcus (SFS; putative area 8Ad) dorsally. Finally, the statistical interaction of the effects of cognitive control produced the strongest foci in caudal LPFC areas including the IFJ and pars opercularis ventrally, and the caudal SFS dorsally, spreading into the mid-lateral PFC. As indicated in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, this interaction was primarily due to reduced activation during the <i>Delay</i> task, which had minimal demands on current processing. Thus, the effects are consistent with <i>Feature Control</i>. Collectively, these results demonstrate a rostral/caudal gradient as a function of cognitive control processes with an orderly progression of <i>Temporal Control, Contextual Control</i>, and <i>Feature Control</i> running from rostral to caudal spanning the entire LPFC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These effects were replicable when the dataset was split into two, confirming their robustness (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

Next, we sought to verify that this gradient reflected increasingly abstract processing in increasingly rostral areas. If processing in the LPFC becomes more abstract in progressively rostral areas, caudal areas should process concrete features such as stimulus-domain, whereas more rostral areas should instantiate control processes that act across domains (e.g. a plan that can be applied to spatial or verbal stimuli). Thus, we reasoned that abstract versus concrete processing would reveal itself through stimulus domain-generality versus specificity."

                                "text": "To test this hypothesis, we used activation peaks of the LPFC ROIs defined by the cognitive control contrasts above. Notably, each contrast produced a distinct dorsal and ventral activation peak spanning rostral areas (FPl, MFG), mid areas (IFS, cMFG), and caudal areas (IFJ, SFS). Hence, this analysis enabled the examination of whether stimulus domain-sensitivity is present throughout the rostral/caudal axis, or whether domain-generality emerges at a particular rostra/caudal level. First, we performed a 2 (dorsal, ventral) x 3 (rostral, mid, caudal) ANOVA on the main effect of <i>Stimulus Domain</i>. This analysis revealed a significant effect of the dorsal/ventral axis (F(1,23) = 100.21, p&lt;10<sup>\u20139</sup>), a significant effect of the rostral/caudal axis (F(2,46) = 10.63, p&lt;0.0005), and critically, an interaction between the dorsal/ventral and rostral/caudal axes (F(2,46) = 56.12, p&lt;10<sup>\u201312</sup>). Follow-up t-tests revealed that caudal and mid ventral areas demonstrated verbal-sensitivity (SFS: t(23) = 5.93, p<sub>corrected</sub>&lt;0.0001; cMFG: t(23) = 5.08, p<sub>corrected</sub>&lt;0.0005), but not rostral areas (MFG: t(23) = 1.54, p<sub>corrected</sub>&gt;0.8). Symmetrically, caudal and mid dorsal areas demonstrated spatial-sensitivity (IFJ: t(23) = 7.83, p<sub>corrected</sub>&lt;10<sup>\u20136</sup>; IFS: t(23) = 5.33, p<sub>corrected</sub>&lt;0.0005), but not rostral areas (FPl: t(23) = \u22122.25, p<sub>corrected</sub> &gt;0.2). A similar lack of stimulus domain-sensitivity was observed in a third rostral peak (rMFG: t(23) = 0.83, p&gt;0.4). This region is not considered further due to lack of resting connectivity with the other LPFC regions (see Materials and methods; <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Collectively, these data indicate caudal and mid LPFC are sensitive to stimulus domain, whereas rostral LPFC areas are domain-general, consistent with a gradient of abstraction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). These effects were replicable when the dataset was split into two, confirming their robustness (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Given the sensitivity of caudal areas to stimulus domain, and the close proximity of the peaks of effects of <i>Stimulus Domain</i> and <i>Feature Control</i> (see Materials and methods; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we use the contrast of <i>Stimulus Domain</i> to define caudal areas in future analyses since they enable the most straight-forward separation of spatial and verbal aspects of <i>Feature Control</i>."

By these ideas, concrete processing in caudal LPFC provides control over current processing (e.g. translating stimuli to actions), while abstract processing in rostral LPFC organizes behavior according to future considerations (e.g. goals or plans). To test this proposal, we examined the degree to which different rostral/caudal levels of the LPFC were related to current processing demands and future processing demands, as indexed by RT. Current demands were operationalized as RT during sub-task trials (i.e. RTs corresponding directly to the epochs at which fMRI signal was measured). Future demands were operationalized as RT during return trials (i.e. RTs corresponding to demands the trial after the fMRI signal was measured). Regressing these measures onto activation revealed a clear gradient such that caudal LPFC was related to current, but not future processing, while rostral LPFC was related to future, but not current processing, with mid LPFC showing activity related to both current and future processing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). To quantify these relationships, we examined partial correlations with the ROIs described above. This revealed significant relationships between caudal LPFC and current (r = 0.69, p<sub>corrected</sub>&lt;10<sup>\u201322</sup>), but not future processing (r = 0.04, p&gt;0.5). Conversely, rostral LPFC was related future (r = 0.31, p<sub>corrected</sub>&lt;0.0005), but not current processing (r = 0.06, p&gt;0.45).

This analysis revealed a significant LPFC level x time interaction (F(2,46) = 30.85, p&lt;10<sup>\u20138</sup>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). T-tests on the individual parameter estimates corroborated the same pattern (caudal-current: t(23) = 8.11, p<sub>corrected</sub>&lt;10<sup>\u20136</sup>; caudal-future: t(23) = 0.80, p&gt;0.4; mid-current: t(23) = 7.21, p<sub>corrected</sub>&lt;10<sup>\u20135</sup>; mid-future: t(23) = 3.14, p<sub>corrected</sub>&lt;0.05; rostral-current: t(23) = \u22120.61, p&gt;0.5; rostral-future: t(23) = 3.60, p<sub>corrected</sub>&lt;0.01). Collectively, these data indicate a temporal abstraction gradient such that caudal LPFC areas reflect current processing demands, while rostral LPFC areas reflect future processing demands. Mid LPFC areas were related to both current and future demands, suggesting a potential zone for integrating rostral and caudal influences. These effects were replicable when the dataset was split into two, confirming their robustness (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Regions that are high in the hierarchy are thought to influence lower regions more than vice versa. Since directed influences cannot be inferred on the basis of correlations alone, we performed dynamic causal modeling (DCM) which describes directed influences between brain regions (effective connectivity) by estimating parameters in a series of differential equations\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib25\">Friston et al., 2003</a>, see\u00a0<a href=\"#bib63\">Stephan et al., 2010</a> for an accessible review). These differential equations include a forward model linking the hemodynamic response to underlying neural activity in order to describe how activity changes in a region as a function of inputs to that region. The ability of DCM to uncover underlying directed neuronal interactions has been validated using large-scale biophysical models (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lee et al., 2006</a>) and invasive recordings in rodents (<a href=\"#bib19\">David et al., 2008</a>). However, since computational complexity precludes modeling all sources of inputs that drive changes in a particular region, DCM can only be applied to simplified neural circuits (i.e. a small number of regions). Such simplifications also require including experimental manipulations such as stimulus delivery and experimental condition as direct drivers and modulators of activity. Despite these simplifications, DCM has been demonstrated to accurately identify the appropriate connections and modulations, even when the modeled regions are only a subset of the regions contributing to a process (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lee et al., 2006</a>). Finally, DCM leverages model comparison to determine the presence and strength of directed regional couplings. This requires specifying multiple (plausible) models and comparing model evidence to reveal which model provides the best account of the data. Hence, DCM can only make relative claims with respect to the explored model space."

Significant parameter estimates resulting from the best model are depicted in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. We began by examining asymmetries in fixed connectivity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Fixed connectivity is constrained by structural connectivity (<a href=\"#bib64\">Stephan et al., 2009b</a>), and thus provides a window into the relative strength of efferent and afferent connections. To evaluate whether fixed connections demonstrate hierarchical dependencies, we calculated the relative strength of efferent versus afferent connections with a simple contrast (average efferent strength \u2013 average afferent strength) based on estimated fixed connectivity of the model. Higher hierarchical areas would be expected to show a positive value on this metric. Similar explorations in the monkey have provided evidence for hierarchical structure, but with controversy surrounding whether the rostral LPFC is the apex of the hierarchy (<a href=\"#bib6\">Badre and D'Esposito, 2009</a>) or the mid LPFC (<a href=\"#bib33\">Goulas et al., 2014</a>). In our dataset, hierarchical strength increased monotonically from caudal areas to mid areas to MFG, but FPl demonstrated the lowest value on this metric resulting in an inverted-U pattern (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). These effects were replicable when the dataset was split into two, confirming their robustness (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This pattern was not due to the average connectivity strength or total connectivity strength, which showed markedly different patterns (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that hierarchical strength is independent of the general magnitude of connectivity."

The position of the vertex provides an estimate of the rostral/caudal location of apex of the hierarchy. Across participants, the height of the vertex was significantly positive (t(23) = 2.34, p&lt;0.05), indicating that the vertex tended to represent the apex of the hierarchy. Furthermore, the vertex tended to be localized to the mid LPFC (mean y-coordinate: 24.7, standard error: 6.1) and differed significantly from both the rostral-most (i.e. FPl; t(23) = -4.35, p&lt;0.0005), and caudal-most ROIs (i.e. SFS; t(23) = 4.18, p&lt;0.0005).

Modulatory dynamics (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) had the following properties: first, <i>Stimulus Domain</i> demands increased connectivity from caudal to mid LPFC areas (hereafter, caudal-to-rostral modulations are referred to as 'bottom-up'). That is, when processing spatial stimuli, connectivity was increased from SFS to cMFG (t(23) = 3.70, q&lt;0.005), while processing verbal stimuli increased connectivity from IFJ to IFS (t(23) = 3.89, q&lt;0.001). Second, cognitive control demands modulated connectivity from rostral to mid LPFC areas (hereafter, rostral-to-caudal modulations are referred to as 'top-down'). <i>Temporal Control</i> increased connectivity from FPl to MFG (t(23) = 2.40, q&lt;0.05). <i>Contextual Control</i> decreased connectivity from FPl to MFG (t(23) = -5.45, q&lt;0.0001), IFS (t23) = -4.76, q&lt;0.0005), and cMFG (t(23) = -4.15, q&lt;0.001), while increasing connectivity from MFG to IFS (t(23) = 8.18, q&lt;10<sup>\u20136</sup>) and cMFG (t(23) = 7.70, q&lt;10<sup>\u20136</sup>). Collectively, these data indicate that demands on stimulus domain influence bottom-up processing, while demands on cognitive control influence top-down processing. These results suggest that demands on cognitive control result in a convergence of influences at the mid LPFC where top-down and bottom-up information meet.

One might be interested in the degree to which the relationship between higher-level cognitive ability and hierarchical strength is selective to mid LPFC. This is difficult to disentangle due to the fact that hierarchical strengths of different regions are interdependent. Nevertheless, a simple average of the mid LPFC hierarchical strength (including cMFG, IFS, and MFG) produced similar results to the height of the vertex method described above (r = 0.48, p&lt;0.05; robust regression t(22) = 2.38, p&lt;0.05). Opposite results were obtained by relating higher-level cognitive ability to the hierarchical strength of caudal LPFC (r = \u22120.43, p&lt;0.05; robust regression t(22) = \u22122.00, p=0.057) and FPl (r = \u22120.42, p&lt;0.05; robust regression t(22) = \u22122.41, p&lt;0.05), which is to be expected given the strong interdependencies between the hierarchical strength of mid LPFC to both caudal and rostral LPFC (mid to caudal, r = \u22120.84, p&lt;10<sup>\u20136</sup>; mid to FPl, r = \u22120.87, p&lt;10<sup>\u20137</sup>).

Collectively, these demands engaged most of LPFC providing the opportunity for a comprehensive account of its function. We found that progressively rostral areas processed progressively abstract levels of cognitive control with demands on <i>Feature Control, Contextual Control</i>, and <i>Temporal Control</i> eliciting increasingly rostral activations. Moreover, stimulus domain-sensitivity was present in caudal and mid LPFC, but not in rostral LPFC consistent with abstract processing in rostral areas. Correlations between neural activation and behavioral performance revealed that caudal LPFC varied linearly with demands on current processing, while rostral LPFC varied linearly with demands on future processing. Both relationships were present in the mid LPFC, indicating a potential zone where current and future processing converges. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that hierarchical asymmetries in connectivity were strongest in mid LPFC. Furthermore, cognitive demands elicited both top-down influences from rostral to mid LPFC and bottom-up influences from caudal to mid LPFC. Thus, analyses of effective connectivity and its modulations suggest that mid LPFC forms a nexus where information converges to influence action. Finally, both the hierarchical orientation of the mid LPFC in fixed connectivity, and the top-down influences from rostral LPFC to mid LPFC during the engagement of cognitive control were positively related to higher-level cognitive ability. Hence, the functional organization of the LPFC is intimately tied to cognitive capacity."

From a computational perspective, hierarchical processing is advantageous (<a href=\"#bib11\">Botvinick and Weinstein, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Solway et al., 2014</a>), although relating such processing advantages to the LPFC has been challenging. Badre and D\u2019Esposito (<a href=\"#bib6\">Badre and D'Esposito, 2009</a>) suggested that the hallmark of hierarchies is asymmetrical influence. That is, those components that are higher in the hierarchy influence lower components more than vice versa. Based on patterns of efferent and afferent projections, they proposed a rostral-to-caudal hierarchy such that rostral areas are higher than caudal areas. Recently, however, the evidence for a rostral-to-caudal hierarchy based on asymmetry of anatomical projections has been called into question. Based on a meta-analysis of projections among areas of the LPFC in monkeys, hierarchy was determined by the asymmetry with which a given area sent projections to other areas compared to the converse (<a href=\"#bib33\">Goulas et al., 2014</a>). The results did not support the notion that rostral LPFC (frontopolar cortex, putative area 10) is the top of the hierarchy. Instead, mid LPFC areas (putative areas 45 and 46) tended to be at the highest hierarchical levels, while area 10 was low in the hierarchy. However, homologies between human and monkey LPFC are still uncertain and there are marked differences between human and monkey frontopolar cortex (<a href=\"#bib58\">Semendeferi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Neubert et al., 2014</a>). Nevertheless, our results examining fixed connectivity, a putative correlate of structural connections, are consistent with the findings that mid LPFC is higher and rostral LPFC is lower in the LPFC hierarchy. Collectively, these data suggest that mid LPFC forms the apex of the frontal hierarchy as measured by asymmetrical connectivity."

In a landmark study, Koechlin et al (<a href=\"#bib39\">Koechlin et al., 2003</a>) demonstrated a cascade of activations across LPFC such that the more temporally remote the control process, the more rostral the activation. Moreover, structural equation modeling revealed significant effective connectivity from rostral to caudal areas as a function of cognitive demands, consistent with a rostral-to-caudal hierarchy. While compelling, rostral-to-caudal models were not compared to other organizational schemes. Since a different organization may have produced superior fits to the data, it is difficult to draw conclusions from these connectivity data. In the present dataset, a strictly rostral-to-caudal model of modulations produced significant top-down modulatory effects consistent with Koechlin et al (<a href=\"#bib39\">Koechlin et al., 2003</a>). However, this model produced a substantially worse fit to the data than the model we describe (see <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), rendering rostral-to-caudal dynamics doubtful."

We found that influences as a function of cognitive demands did not follow a strict rostral-to-caudal progression. While cognitive control demands did modulate influences from rostral to mid areas, stimulus domain demands modulated influences from caudal to mid areas. This pattern of connectivity is consistent with the notion that mid areas are an integration zone where domain-general top-down influences and domain-specific bottom-up influences converge. This is corroborated by the activation-behavior relationships which demonstrated that whereas rostral and caudal areas were related to future and current processing, respectively, mid areas were related to both. This suggests that mid LPFC simultaneously represents information from both rostral and caudal areas. From a developmental perspective, it is interesting to note that mid LPFC areas develop later than caudal and rostral LPFC areas (<a href=\"#bib59\">Shaw et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gogtay et al., 2004</a>). As a general pattern, integrative areas tend to develop later than the areas over which they integrate (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gogtay et al., 2004</a>). Thus, the maturation of mid LPFC areas may be influenced by simultaneous top-down and bottom-up demands (<a href=\"#bib6\">Badre and D'Esposito, 2009</a>) preparing the mid LPFC for an integrative role. These ideas are bolstered by evidence that the mid LPFC is a cortical hub with high global connectivity, the degree of which predicts intelligence (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cole et al., 2012</a>). If mid LPFC is a convergence zone where top-down influences from rostral LPFC and bottom-up influences from caudal LPFC meet, it could serve to integrate abstract goals or intentions from rostral areas and concrete contextual information from caudal areas in order to guide action selection."

They found that those patients that had damage to mid LPFC demonstrated impaired performance at higher levels of the task, but not lower levels, while patients that had damage to a caudal LPFC demonstrated impaired performance on both higher and lower levels of the task. These results were recently replicated and extended with a different task whereby similar asymmetries were observed across three levels: caudal, mid, and rostral LPFC (<a href=\"#bib3\">Azuar et al., 2014</a>).

As depicted in the model, this is due to bottom-up, but not top-down, modulations from caudal LPFC to mid LPFC as a function of cognitive demand. Of note is that mid LPFC lesions in the studies of Badre et al (<a href=\"#bib6\">Badre et al., 2009</a>) and Azuar et al (<a href=\"#bib3\">Azuar et al., 2014</a>) appeared to include the area we refer to as MFG (putative area 9/46). In our model, MFG processes sub-task cues, consistent with its role in rule processing (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nee and Brown, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bunge et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Genovesio et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wallis et al., 2001</a>). Given that all of the cognitive control demands require processing the sub-task cues, lesions to MFG would affect all of the cognitive control sub-tasks. In this way, operations of FPl are dependent on an intact MFG. Furthermore, in the model, modulations from FPl onto mid LPFC are inhibitory in nature, counteracting the baseline positive influence observed in the fixed connectivity. Thus, the cancellation of negative and positive influences could lead to a negligible impact of FPl lesions on mid LPFC processing. Collectively then, our model indicates that a similar rostral/caudal cascade of asymmetric impairments could be observed with the present task dynamics. Furthermore, our data highlight the need for task-based modeling of neural dynamics in the intact brain to unravel the mechanisms that can lead to lesion-based deficits."

This is in contrast to the excitatory modulation from FPl to MFG observed during <i>Temporal Control</i> demands. While <i>Temporal Control</i> required preserving past information in order to integrate it into future processing, <i>Contextual Control</i> required the isolation of current processing from previous and future processing. Our data suggest that the dynamics of FPl reflect these two forms of processing. That is, excitatory influence from FPl promotes integrative processing, while inhibitory influence from FPl promotes segregated processing. Such inhibitory influences during <i>Contextual\u00a0Control</i> may have been necessary to overcome the positive fixed connectivity observed between FPl and other regions. Hence, although FPl was active for both <i>Temporal Control</i> and <i>Contextual Control</i>, this activity promoted different forms of processing under different conditions, realized by dynamic interactions between FPl and other areas of the LPFC."

Recent work has demonstrated that the LPFC flexibly adapts its connectivity as a function of task demands (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cole et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that dynamics in the LPFC may be of central importance for cognitive control.

However, different definitions of hierarchy may lead to different assignments of rank among the LPFC. For example, hierarchy may be defined by temporal control, with higher levels organizing behavior over broader timescales (<a href=\"#bib37\">Koechlin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">2003</a>). Alternatively, hierarchy could be defined by modulations of influence as a result of cognitive demands. Such relationships are typified by the top-down biasing that LPFC exerts over posterior areas during difficult selections (<a href=\"#bib46\">Miller and Cohen, 2001</a>). These various definitions lead to different rank orderings in our data. However, regardless of definition, the mid LPFC appeared to play a central role in our data showing the greatest outward relative to inward asymmetry, containing both future and present oriented signals that related to behavior, and providing a convergence zone of modulatory inputs.

Gradients of activation along the rostral/caudal axis of the LPFC have been observed by manipulating the temporal timescale of control processing and relational complexity (see\u00a0<a href=\"#bib8\">Badre, 2008</a> for an in-depth review). However, activations spanning the rostral/caudal axis of the LPFC can be observed by tasks that do not clearly manipulate these processes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Crittenden and Duncan, 2014</a>), and manipulations of these processes do not always lead to orderly gradients of activation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Reynolds et al., 2012</a>). The purpose of the present study was not to resolve these issues (but see\u00a0<a href=\"#bib51\">Nee et al., 2014</a> for a recent attempt).

In these data, caudal LPFC was involved in current processing, providing selective attention to visual stimulus features, while rostral LPFC was involved in future processing, enabling the retention of information for integration into future processing. The mid LPFC appeared to synthesize both current and future processing allowing the use of current and future informed contextual information to organize behavior.

Long-lasting abstract representations such as goals or plans are thought to influence concrete representations such as actions. Mid-level representations such as contexts are in-between, governing the correct action tendencies given the prevailing situation. By a rostral-to-caudal hierarchy then, goals should govern contexts. However, it is often the case that contexts dictate whether a goal is achievable or not (e.g. a social situation is not a good context within which to write a manuscript). In such cases, the context may suggest a new goal to pursue (e.g. network instead of write). Hence, the ideal controller may take into account longer-term objectives and the current situation in order to arrive at the correct behavior for the moment. Our data indicate that the mid LPFC has the connectivity properties of such a controller, thereby forming a central nexus for cognitive control."

We defined rostral LPFC by pooling activations in FPl and MFG, mid LPFC by pooling IFS and cMFG, and caudal LPFC by pooling IFJ and SFS. Areas were defined based upon peaks of the entire dataset described above with the exception that caudal areas were defined based on the main effect of <i>Stimulus Domain</i>, which produced ROIs slightly more distanced from the mid LPFC (SFS: -22 0 54; IFJ: -38 6 26). These caudal ROIs were used for all subsequent analyses. Second, partial correlations between activation and Current RT (controlling for Future RT), and activation and Future RT (controlling for Current RT) were calculated after regressing out subject-specific effects using a dummy variable approach. The above two analyses were used for visualization since they produce the most straightforward means to depict the observed relationships. However, to better statistically control for subject-specific effects, we used a summary statistic approach by regressing Current and Future RTs on activations separately for each LPFC zone in each subject and then performing statistics on the corresponding regression slopes. We also performed a linear mixed effects approach that is not described due to redundancy. All four approaches yielded consistent results. All ROI-based tests were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons."

Our fixed connection assumptions were further tested by examining interconnectivity among our LPFC ROIs in resting state data collected during each fMRI session. For each ROI, we calculated connectivity for all other voxels of the brain through a simple time-series correlation. Next, we sorted these connectivity values, excluding voxels within 1.5 cm of the center of the ROI. To determine whether an LPFC region, <i>r</i>, was connected to the ROI, we asked whether connectivity between the ROI and <i>r</i> fell within the top <i>c</i>% of connectivity values, where <i>c</i> can be considered the cost. Connectivity was assessed at a range of costs from 5 to 35. At low costs, connectivity was sparse and at high costs connectivity was dense (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

We examined how experimental manipulations of <i>Stimulus Domain, Contextual Control</i>, and <i>Temporal Control</i> modulated connectivity among the LPFC. <i>Stimulus Domain</i> was split separately into verbal and spatial factors. Modulations were explored during the sub-task phases of each block, modeling the same periods as the univariate analyses described above.

We also explored lateral connectivity in the case of <i>Stimulus Domain</i> (IFJ-SFS, IFS-cMFG) to examine the possibility of inhibitory segregation. In different models, we estimated parameters assuming top-down, bottom-up, bi-directional, or no modulation. In this framework, there are over 20,000 potential models.

To make the problem computationally tractable, we reduced the model space by yoking the directionality of dorsal and ventral pathway modulations (e.g. if <i>Spatial Stimulus Domain</i> was a bottom-up modulator, then <i>Verbal Stimulus Domain</i> was also a bottom-up modulator for a particular model). Furthermore, we did not explore disjointed modulation in the case of the <i>Contextual Control</i> factor (i.e. modulations of rostral and caudal connections, but not mid-level connections). Finally, we used an iterative approach to traverse the remaining model space. First, we found the best model for modulations by <i>Stimulus Domain</i> (Model S). Next, assuming S, we found the best model for modulations by <i>Temporal Control</i> (Model T). Next, assuming S and T, we found the best model for modulations by <i>Contextual Control</i> (Model C). Thereafter, we revisited <i>Stimulus Domain</i> modulations assuming T and C (Model S\u2019), then commensurately revisited <i>Temporal Control</i> assuming S\u2019 and C, and so on. We iterated this process until convergence. In each phase, the best model was chosen through Bayesian model selection as the model showing the highest model exceedance probability assuming random effects (<a href=\"#bib62\">Stephan et al., 2009</a>). The model exceedance probability is the probability of one model being more likely than any other model under consideration. The random effects procedure allows for the possibility of different models/strategies across participants and is far more robust against outliers than fixed effects procedures. Across the 6 iterations of the iterative procedure, the mean model exceedance probability of the best model was 0.72 (range 0.54\u20130.86). A total of 99 models were explored across the iterations. Comparing across the 99 tested models, the model that the iterative approach settled upon had a model exceedance probability of 0.18 (compare to a uniform of 0.01). This was more than twice the model exceedance probability of the next best model. Only 5 models had a model exceedance probability over 0.05. All of these 5 models were highly similar to one another (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Hence, it is unlikely that the appropriate model for the observed dynamics is far different from the one explored in the text."

These parameters included the strength of fixed connectivity (A matrix), input sensitivity (C matrix), and the strength of connectivity modulations (B matrix). P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using false-discovery rate. To determine the robustness of these parameters, we split the dataset in two using an alternating runs procedure, excluding the participant that completed only a single session (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To examine the relationship between top-down modulations, bottom-up modulations, and higher-level cognitive ability, we created factors for each metric using principle components analysis. The first eigenvariate was computed across all top-down modulations, all bottom-up modulations, and all trait-measures of cognitive ability, respectively. Signs were adjusted, if needed, so that higher positive values were associated with more of a given measure. These factors were then inter-correlated. To examine hierarchical strength, we contrasted the average efferent connectivity of a region with the average afferent connectivity along the rostral/caudal axis (connections running dorsal/ventral were ignored). This approach is similar to that used in a recent study involving hierarchical projections in the monkey (<a href=\"#bib33\">Goulas et al., 2014</a>). Since the meaning of negative connectivity is unclear in this procedure, negative connections were set to 0 (17% of all connections across participants). The results remain if we omit this assumption. To provide a summary measure of hierarchical strength of mid LPFC, we fit a quadratic function to each participants\u2019 hierarchical strength metrics. In these models, the y-coordinate of each ROI, reflecting rostral/caudal location, was used as the predictor variable, while hierarchical strength was used as the predicted variable. The vertex of the quadratic function corresponds to either the apex of the hierarchy (peak) or basin of the hierarchy (trough). Inferences were performed on the rostral/caudal position and height of the vertex. The height of the vertex was used as a summary of hierarchical strength of fixed connectivity, and was correlated with the higher-level cognitive ability factor described above. Correlations were supplemented by robust regression, which reduces the impact of high-leverage outliers."

Second, we have changed the names of the cognitive control processes to make better contact with previous literature. You will now find \u201cDelayed Integration\u201d referred to as \u201cTemporal Control\u201d and \u201cContextualization\u201d as \u201cContextual Control.\u201d We further spell-out how the statistical interaction of the cognitive control processes is expected to reveal processing related to selective attention for working memory, which we refer to as \u201cFeature Control.\u201d Finally, we have added a section in the Discussion describing theories and controversies about processing along the rostral/caudal axis of the LPFC and how the present data fit within that debate.

By the nature of the contrasts, any two areas that are connected have dependencies on this metric \u2013 that is, hierarchical strength of connected areas is anti-correlated. As might be anticipated by such interdependencies, not only is hierarchical strength of the mid LPFC positively related to cognitive ability, caudal and rostral LPFC are negatively related to cognitive ability.
