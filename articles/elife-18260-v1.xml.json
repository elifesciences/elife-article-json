Here, we utilized continuous measures of retrieval to dissociate three components of episodic memory: retrieval success, precision, and vividness. In the fMRI scanner, participants encoded objects that varied continuously on three features: color, orientation, and location. Participants\u2019 memory was tested by having them recreate the appearance of the object features using a continuous dial, and continuous vividness judgments were recorded. Retrieval success, precision, and vividness were dissociable both behaviorally and neurally: successful versus unsuccessful retrieval was associated with hippocampal activity, retrieval precision scaled with activity in the angular gyrus, and vividness judgments tracked activity in the precuneus. The ability to dissociate these components of episodic memory reveals the benefit afforded by measuring memory on a continuous scale, allowing functional parcellation of the retrieval network."

Here, we utilized continuous measures of retrieval to dissociate three components of episodic memory: retrieval success, precision, and vividness. In the fMRI scanner, participants encoded objects that varied continuously on three features: color, orientation, and location. Participants\u2019 memory was tested by having them recreate the appearance of the object features using a continuous dial, and continuous vividness judgments were recorded. Retrieval success, precision, and vividness were dissociable both behaviorally and neurally: successful versus unsuccessful retrieval was associated with hippocampal activity, retrieval precision scaled with activity in the angular gyrus, and vividness judgments tracked activity in the precuneus. The ability to dissociate these components of episodic memory reveals the benefit afforded by measuring memory on a continuous scale, allowing functional parcellation of the retrieval network."

Memory retrieval involves a complex set of processes that activate a large network of brain regions (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rugg and Vilberg, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Spaniol et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kim, 2010</a>). Recently, it has been suggested that the memory retrieval network can be divided into two sub-systems (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</a>), both anchored on the hippocampus: an anterior temporal system, comprising the amygdala, temporopolar cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and perirhinal cortex, and a posterior medial system, including regions such as the posterior cingulate, precuneus, angular gyrus (AnG), medial prefrontal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex. According to this framework, the anterior temporal system is more related to semantic memory, familiarity judgments, and event salience, whereas the posterior medial system contributes to episodic memory and recollection. Despite such attempts to characterize sub-systems within the retrieval network, and suggestions about the roles of some of its constituent regions, functional specializations within the memory retrieval network remain poorly understood, in part due to common co-activation during most retrieval tasks."

                        "text": "It is likely that memory retrieval tasks typically activate such a wide network of regions because the components of successful retrieval can reflect the contribution of a number of different properties of memory representations, such as their subjective vividness, objective accuracy, and the objective level of detail, specificity, or precision with which they are retrieved. To better understand how memory judgments are derived, it is important to consider that the outcome of a retrieval attempt is typically not \u2018all-or-none\u2019, but that the amount and quality of information we retrieve can vary considerably (<a href=\"#bib31\">Parks and Yonelinas, 2007</a>). In order to distinguish memory retrieval components and the role of regions within the retrieval network, it is necessary to use sensitive measures that can detect such variations in retrieval performance. Consistent with this approach, some research has studied the specificity with which memories can be retrieved as an alternative to simple 'old/new' decisions or other categorical judgments such as \u2018remember/know\u2019. For example, source memory tasks, requiring participants to remember the context in which an item was studied, have revealed that participants sometimes remember 'partial source' information (such as the gender of a speaker), but not necessarily all specific details (<a href=\"#bib39\">Simons et al., 2004</a>). The idea that memory representations can vary in quality has prompted researchers to measure recollection objectively using more graded measures, exploring how many details can be remembered (<a href=\"#bib21\">Horner and Burgess, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Qin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Vilberg and Rugg, 2009</a>). Although such measures are important advances in capturing differences in retrieval outcome, they remain essentially categorical. Memory is not only defined by the number of details that are remembered, but also by the fidelity with which those details can be recalled (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brady et al., 2013</a>)."

These influential methods from the working memory literature have started to be applied to behavioral studies of long-term memory (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brady et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, it is possible to separate behaviorally the probability of recollection success from the precision with which information is retrieved (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harlow and Donaldson, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Harlow and Yonelinas, 2016</a>), which can be differentially influenced by attention and retrieval practice (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fan and Turk-Browne, 2013</a>). Furthermore, a recent EEG study supports the idea that variations in long-term memory precision may be associated with distinct neural signatures, finding the well-established left parietal old/new effect to be graded according to recollection precision (<a href=\"#bib29\">Murray et al., 2015</a>). The observation that retrieval success and retrieval precision can be manipulated independently suggests that using continuous measures to differentiate such components will lead to a more detailed understanding of episodic memory retrieval at both behavioral and neural levels."

However, increasing research has additionally considered subjective or metacognitive measures of memory performance, such as confidence (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yonelinas, 1994</a>) or the vividness with which retrieved memories are experienced (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kuhl and Chun, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">St-Laurent et al., 2015</a>). Research has found that subjective and objective measures of memory performance can diverge (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chua et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Harlow and Yonelinas, 2016</a>). Most notably, patients with parietal cortex lesions exhibit impairment in subjective memory reports even though their objective performance appears to be intact (<a href=\"#bib40\">Simons et al., 2010</a>), and lateral parietal transcranial magnetic stimulation has been found to selectively reduce memory confidence but not retrieval success (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yazar et al., 2014</a>). One possibility is that the subjective and objective memory components that may drive mnemonic decisions are separable, with subjective aspects of retrieval, such as vividness, and objective aspects of retrieval, such as success and precision, relying on largely independent processes. Alternatively, it is possible that performance on subjective measures of memory retrieval used to date can be fully explained by subtle variations in objective memory, such as the precision with which a memory is recalled, which previous objective measures may not have been sensitive enough to detect."

To understand the roles of brain regions within the retrieval network and to dissociate memory retrieval components, more sensitive, continuous measures of memory performance are needed. In the current study, we combined continuous long-term memory measures in an fMRI paradigm with model-based approaches derived from the working memory literature. For each retrieval trial we obtained a binary measure of retrieval success (successful versus unsuccessful), a continuous measure of the precision with which color, orientation, and location features of visual objects were remembered (based on the error between a target value and the participant\u2019s response), as well as a subjective vividness rating, on a continuous scale. These measures allowed us to characterize behavioral and neural mechanisms that distinguish between recollection success, precision, and the vividness with which information is retrieved."

The distribution of errors for all 5724 trials across all participants and features (see Materials and methods) can be seen in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. Three models were fitted to the error data (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bays et al., 2009</a>), both across all trials as well as separately for each participant, and model fit was assessed via Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Modeling the errors with a von Mises (circular normal) distribution alone (model 1) fit the data less well than a mixture model (model 2) that also included a uniform component (AIC difference: 1882.2; BIC difference: 1875.6; also true across subjects, AIC: <i>t</i>(19) = 9.01, p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001; BIC: <i>t</i>(19) = 8.63, p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) and a third model in which non-target binding errors were additionally accounted for (AIC difference: 1880.2; BIC difference: 1866.9; also true across subjects, AIC: <i>t</i>(19) = 8.96, p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001; BIC: <i>t</i>(19) = 8.20, p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001).

Therefore, the distribution of errors was best characterized by a model with one parameter capturing the proportion of successfully retrieved features (responses within the von Mises distribution relative to the uniform distribution) and another parameter capturing the precision (concentration) of successfully retrieved memories. As seen in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, errors clustered around the target value, indicating that participants often successfully retrieved information about the probed feature. Moreover, a certain percentage of trials resulted in errors evenly distributed between \u2212180 and 180 degrees, consistent with responses due to forgetting. Using model 2 (von Mises +\u00a0uniform), the estimated mean proportion of trials successfully retrieved was 0.62 (<i>SD</i> = 0.16), and estimated mean precision (assessed by the concentration parameter of the von Mises distribution) was 10.05 (<i>SD</i> = 3.41). The distribution of vividness responses across all subjects and trials can also be seen in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. We calculated the mean vividness across all 48 displays for each subject (<i>mean</i> = 48.23, <i>SD</i> = 15.83), which indicated that subjects' memories were, on average, moderately vivid, and responses were widely spread between 0\u2013100."

Trial-specific estimates of precision were obtained by subtracting the absolute difference between the target value and the reported value (ranging from 0\u2013180 degrees) from 180 (the maximum possible error), so that higher values reflected higher precision.

To directly test whether the activations observed in the three ROIs for the three contrasts differed in a statistically reliable manner, we conducted a 3 (ROI: hippocampus, AnG, precuneus) \u00d7 3 (contrast: retrieval success, precision, vividness) ANOVA on the first level <i>t</i>-values for each contrast from each ROI. (First level <i>t</i>-values were used because the parameter estimates for the retrieval success contrast reflect the mean difference in BOLD signal, whereas the parameter estimates for the parametric modulators reflect the rate of change of BOLD signal with precision and vividness, meaning that the beta values are not directly comparable). The ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between contrast and ROI (<i>F<sub>Huynh-Feldt</sub></i>(2.973, 56.482) = 4.02, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012, <i>\u03b7</i>\u00b2 =\u00a00.05, see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>), indicating that the pattern of regional activity differed significantly between the contrasts. To explore this interaction further, three 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 ANOVAs were conducted between each pair of contrasts and the region that had the strongest associated activity for each contrast. All three ANOVAs revealed significant interactions between ROI and contrast (all <i>F</i> &gt; 4.63, all p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05, all <i>\u03b7</i>\u00b2 &gt;\u00a00.03), further specifying the distinct roles of the ROIs in the memory retrieval components of interest. Conducting conjunction analyses within the ROIs for each of the three pairs of contrasts revealed no voxels in which there was any significant overlap even at a liberal threshold using a conjoint probability of p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001 (uncorrected) (each individual contrast set to a threshold of p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01), consistent with the findings of significant activity in only one ROI per contrast."

Retrieval success (successful vs. unsuccessful) was associated with BOLD signal increases in hippocampus, whereas retrieval precision scaled with brain activity in AnG. Both these objective measures of retrieval performance were dissociable from a subjective continuous measure of retrieval vividness, which was tracked by activity in the\u00a0precuneus. The apparently separable contribution of these three nodes of the episodic retrieval network was confirmed by significant statistical interactions between region and component, and by the lack of overlap in activity revealed by conjunction analyses.

The hippocampus has received most attention in the literature as a 'memory region', because of the profound memory deficits associated with hippocampal damage (<a href=\"#bib37\">Scoville and Milner, 1957</a>), and the frequent reports of hippocampal activity during neuroimaging studies of memory retrieval (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schacter and Wagner, 1999</a>). One proposal in the cognitive literature has been that hippocampal activity might relate to a threshold retrieval signal (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yonelinas, 2002</a>), such that items only elicit a hippocampal recollection response once a specific qualitative information threshold is reached. Consistent with this view, computational models of hippocampal function have produced thresholded output, such that some items produce a memory signal strong enough to elicit an 'old' response, whereas items that remain below the required threshold are indistinguishable to the model from new items (<a href=\"#bib30\">Norman, 2010</a>). fMRI results have supported the view that hippocampal activity during retrieval is characterized by distinct states, such that it responds to recollection responses, for example in source memory tasks (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ranganath et al., 2004</a>), but not graded familiarity judgments (<a href=\"#bib27\">Montaldi et al., 2006</a>). Our observation of a categorical retrieval success effect in the\u00a0hippocampus is thus consistent with these prior results, but our findings provide novel constraints on understanding of the specificity of the hippocampal role in episodic memory by demonstrating a disproportionately greater role in retrieval success than graded precision or subjective vividness."

This dissociation between hippocampus and AnG is consistent with the notion of a strongly interconnected cortico-hippocampal network in which hippocampus initiates retrieval, which is then further supported by cortical regions (<a href=\"#bib26\">McClelland et al., 1995</a>), with increasing connectivity between different nodes in the network being related to superior mnemonic performance (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). The specific dissociation between hippocampus and AnG observed here is also consistent with recent reports that hippocampal signals are transient during memory retrieval, as might be expected of a threshold signal, whereas AnG responses are more sustained over the retrieval period, possibly consistent with a role in the active representation of information (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vilberg and Rugg, 2012</a>). The various roles attributed to inferior parietal regions such as AnG during memory retrieval include attentional capture by retrieved information (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cabeza et al., 2008</a>), the accumulation of evidence in memory (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wagner et al., 2005</a>), or a 'buffer' that stores information for further evaluation during long-term memory retrieval (<a href=\"#bib45\">Vilberg and Rugg, 2008</a>). Consistent with the latter account, recent work supports a role for AnG in carrying specific details of memory representations, finding that episodic memories are represented individually and can be decoded by multivariate classifier analyses in this area (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bonnici et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kuhl and Chun, 2014</a>). These findings indicate that AnG may represent the information on which a mnemonic decision is based, with properties of the representation such as its level of detail or the fidelity of the information retrieved driving decisions about a memory\u2019s origin and other associated features. This representation of detailed memory features might uniquely qualify AnG for demanding mnemonic computations like precision judgments or the integration of complex retrieved features, which hippocampus might instead only support indirectly by initiating and orchestrating other mnemonic processes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vilberg and Rugg, 2012</a>). Additionally, the observation of trial-to-trial variation in AnG activity, correlated with retrieval precision, is consistent with proposals from the working memory literature that memory fidelity may vary from one retrieval instance to the next (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fougnie et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">van den Berg et al., 2012</a>), and specifically that memory precision may be determined by the gain of neural activity encoding a stimulus (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bays, 2014</a>)."

In line with a proposed involvement in vividness judgments, previous evidence has found greater connectivity between prefrontal cortex and precuneus during metacognitive decisions concerning retrieved memories (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baird et al., 2013</a>), supporting a role for medial parietal regions in assessments of subjective memory quality. Furthermore, a correlation between precuneus structural volume and recollection from a first-person perspective (<a href=\"#bib17\">Freton et al., 2014</a>) is consistent with a contribution to reinstating and maintaining a vivid subjective memory representation. The involvement of the precuneus in facilitating subjective memory vividness could explain its common activation during memory retrieval tasks, such as tests of source memory, that often require retrieval of rich and vivid episodic information (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lundstrom et al., 2005</a>). It has been proposed that activity in the precuneus reflects the requirement for mental imagery during retrieval (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fletcher et al., 1995</a>). The function of the precuneus might thus be complementary to that of the hippocampus, which may be involved in the initial aspects of a proposed \u2018scene construction\u2019 process that occurs when a memory is retrieved, but not in the maintenance of the scene in working memory following construction (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zeidman et al., 2015</a>). In accordance with such a distinction, our current data are consistent with the idea that the hippocampus might play an initial role in driving the reconstruction process, but that further translation into an imageable, first person perspective event occurs via precuneus (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burgess et al., 2001</a>)."

Moreover, patients with lesions that include the lateral parietal lobe often report reduced memory detail and diminished recollection vividness (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berryhill et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Simons et al., 2010</a>). At first glance, our results might appear to diverge from these prior reports. However, we believe our findings help to distinguish the contributions of precuneus, hippocampus, and AnG to subjective aspects of recollection, by capitalizing on two specific advantages of our study. In previous work, vividness ratings were often recorded <i>after</i> the mnemonic decision, meaning that judgments could reflect the\u00a0participants\u2019 perception of how they had performed on that trial; moreover, vividness and precision or retrieval success effects were not distinguished, such that vividness is likely to have been confounded with precision and/or retrieval success. In the current study, making the vividness rating <i>before</i> any decision on the objects ensured that it reflected participants\u2019 assessment of their subjective ability to bring to mind the appearance of the objects on the display, rather than the\u00a0influences of perceived difficulty or post-decision processing (<a href=\"#bib38\">Siedlecka et al., 2016</a>). Second, we modeled vividness, retrieval success and precision within the same general linear model, meaning that they accounted for independent sources of variance. While our three memory measures were clearly dissociable, they were not completely independent from each other (and in fact were correlated at <i>r</i> = ~0.5 across subjects in the current study). This moderate correlation would imply that trials which were more precisely and/or successfully remembered would be, on average, associated with higher vividness ratings, possibly explaining previous reports of a link between vividness ratings and brain activity in AnG (cf. <a href=\"#bib8\">Bonnici et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kuhl and Chun, 2014</a>), or hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ford and Kensinger, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gilboa et al., 2004</a>). Regarding reports of diminished vividness following parietal cortex lesions, such lesions are frequently not selective to <i>lateral</i> parietal cortex (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berryhill et al., 2007</a>), often including medial parietal areas. Moreover, lateral and medial areas are heavily interconnected (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhang and Li, 2012</a>), such that lateral parietal lesions could to some extent affect medial parietal function, by resulting in diminished input into medial parietal regions. This diminished input to medial parietal areas could affect judgments of memory vividness, because the information necessary for the maintenance of a vivid mental scene might be less readily available. Thus, our current data suggest that medial parietal regions play a role in evaluating the perceived vividness of participants\u2019 memories, a judgment that may be based on the level of detail or precision of the memory represented in AnG, although further research is still required to tease apart the relative contributions of these regions and elucidate the processes underlying judgments of memory vividness and confidence."

We demonstrate that regions of the episodic memory network that are normally co-activated during retrieval can be dissociated and linked to specific aspects of retrieval performance. Using the current approach to study and analyze behavioral and fMRI memory data, future studies will be able to characterize more accurately the mechanisms involved in different retrieval tasks, and to assess specific variations in memory performance in target groups, such as patients and older adults."

Subjects were instructed to try to learn the appearance of the objects on the display, including their color, orientation, and location on the background, as best as they could. Displays were separated by a fixation cross of varying duration (400 to 2800 ms, approaching a Poisson distribution, with a mean of 961.1 ms). A 10 s delay followed the encoding phase before the retrieval phase started. In each retrieval phase trial, participants were presented first with only the background scene of a display and were asked to rate how vividly they remembered the appearance of the objects associated with the presented background, based on their memory for the identity and features of all three objects. The background was presented for 2 s with the question \u201cHow vividly do you remember this display?\u201d in white font. After 2 s, a slider was added with the labels \u2018not vividly\u2019 and \u2018very vividly\u2019 at the end points. Subjects had 6 s to respond using their index and middle finger to indicate the vividness of their memory on a continuous scale of 0 ('not vividly') to 100 ('very vividly'). They confirmed their responses by pressing a third button with their thumb. In cases where participants did not respond within the first 4 s, the text turned red to indicate to participants that they had 2 s left in which they could respond. The vividness scale was represented by a 500 pixel wide line, on which participants could move a cursor up or down by holding down one or the other of two buttons. Each \u2018press\u2019 of the button moved the cursor by 5 pixels, resulting in the 100-point scale. The vividness rating was requested from participants before they recreated any of the object features so that their subjective vividness judgment would not be influenced by their experience of their performance on that trial. Participants were then tested on their memory for two of the three objects that were associated with a given display, with the same two objects tested for all participants. Each tested object was initially presented in a random color, location, and orientation. The participants\u2019 task was to sequentially recreate the objects\u2019 original features (color/orientation/location) using a continuous dial (360 increments) over 6 judgments (3 features for 2 objects). For each judgment, a cue word in the center of the screen instructed the participant which object feature they were being asked to recall (\u2018Color\u2019, \u2018Orientation\u2019, or \u2018Location\u2019). Participants had 6 s to recreate these object features as precisely as they could using their index and middle finger to change the features on a continuous dial. Similar to the vividness rating, the color of the cue word changed from white to red if no response was made within the first 4 s of the 6 s response window. The order in which the features were tested was counterbalanced, such that (1) each of the 6 possible orders of the feature questions was tested equally and (2) the same feature was not tested more than 4 times in a row at the same position (first, second, or third). Once participants recreated one of the object features, the feature value chosen (from 0\u2013360 around the circular space) would be carried over to the subsequent questions for that object. A fixation cross of varying length (400 to 2800 ms, approaching a Poisson distribution, with a mean of 961.1 ms) was displayed after the vividness question as well as after each of the object feature questions."

Model 1 assumes participants' memories continuously vary in precision from 0\u2013180 degrees (with no guessed responses), model 2 assumes that participants either remember a feature with varying precision or guess, resulting in a uniform distribution of responses around the circle, and model 3 assumes that, in addition to model 2, participants also commit binding errors where they remember the color/orientation/location that was present in one of the two other objects in the display, but not the target object. Retrieval success was estimated as the proportion of responses that fell within the von Mises distribution, and precision was estimated as the concentration of the von Mises distribution. Importantly, using this operationalization, retrieval success and precision can vary independently, so that high retrieval success does not necessarily imply a participant will also have high retrieval precision (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> for simulated data that illustrates this dissociation). Of note, when the three models were fitted within each feature separately, assessment of the model fit revealed the same pattern as for all features."

Structural images were obtained using a T1-weighted protocol (256 \u00d7 256 matrix, 192 1-mm sagittal slices, TR = 2.25\u2009s, TE = 3 ms). Functional images were acquired approximately parallel to the AC\u2013PC transverse plane using a single-shot EPI sequence (TR = 2\u2009s; TE = 30 ms; field of view = 192 \u00d7 192\u2009mm, flip angle = 78 degrees). Functional scans were obtained as 32 contiguous oblique-axial slices (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3-mm voxels) per volume. Each fMRI scan run (block) consisted of one encoding phase followed by one retrieval phase and a total of 205 volumes were collected (6\u2009m 50\u2009s) during each block. ITIs were jittered within each block so that the total duration of each block was the same. Of the 205 volumes, the first 5 were accompanied by a 'Get Ready' screen and were discarded prior to analyses. The next approximately 39 volumes corresponded to the encoding phase. Following the encoding phase, another short break including a 'Get Ready' screen was included for the duration of 5 volumes, and the final approximately 156 volumes corresponded to the retrieval phase."

For each participant the structural image was coregistered to the SPM MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) template and then bias corrected to control for intensity differences due to inhomegeneities. The structural image was then segmented into different tissue classes (grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) using SPM\u2019s unified segmentation approach (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ashburner and Friston, 2005</a>). The individual subjects\u2019 tissue class images from this segmentation step were used to create a custom template structural image using DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra). The structural images were transformed to MNI space, and finally, were smoothed with an 8-mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. The functional images were motion-corrected and were realigned to the middle functional image to correct for effects of slice timing. The EPI images were then coregistered to the structural image and normalized to MNI space using the DARTEL template. Functional Images were smoothed using a 8\u00a0mm FWHM Gaussian kernel."

To classify trials as successfully or unsuccessfully retrieved, we generated an error threshold (from 0\u2013180 degrees) based on the model fitted across all errors, below which trials would be classed as successfully retrieved, and above which trials would be classed as unsuccessful. Specifically, the probability density functions of the von Mises and uniform distributions were computed and the threshold for successful retrieval was calculated by estimating the point at which the slope of the von Mises distribution approached zero, approximated by determining the point at which the probability that a response was drawn from the von Mises distribution reached 5% (resulting in a cut off of +/- 63 degrees from the target value). Therefore, successfully retrieved trials were defined as a response within 63 degrees of the correct answer. Even though the three features were modeled separately, all analyses were conducted across the features so that fMRI effects reflected the underlying memory processes tested, not memory for a particular feature."

The durations used to model the data were 12 s for the encoding displays, 8 s for the vividness rating, and 6 s for the feature questions. Moreover, parametric modulators were included to model precision and vividness effects that reflect the degree to which activity correlated with trial-by-trial fluctuations in behavior. The parametric modulator for encoding trials corresponded to the number of subsequently successfully retrieved features (ranging from 0 to 6) for each display. The trial-by-trial vividness ratings (continuous from 0\u2013100) were included as a parametric modulator for vividness trials, and, for successfully retrieved trials brain activity was modulated with the precision of the response, which was calculated as 180 minus the error so that higher values indicated higher precision (responding close to the target). Therefore, precision values ranged from 180 (maximum precision) to 117 (minimum precision for successful retrieval). Unsuccessfully retrieved trials were not parametrically modulated as any variability in error from the target value was assumed to be due to guessing in these trials. Parametric modulators were mean centered to ensure that the non-parametric effects of these variables represent the mean activity of the event type (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mumford et al., 2015</a>). Time and dispersion derivatives were included for each event and each parametric modulator. The 8 separate scan blocks were concatenated for analysis to obtain more stable parameter estimates due to increasing the number of trials per condition, as is often the case for designs splitting trials by performance (<a href=\"#bib43\">Uncapher et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bergstr\u00f6m et al., 2015</a>). As runs were concatenated, standard high pass filtering using SPM was not possible, as SPM would treat the runs as one continuous time-series. Therefore, a high pass filter was applied by including six additional regressors for each block representing a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) set capturing frequencies up to 1/128\u2009Hz. Six additional regressors representing motion were included per block and eight additional constant regressors were included to model differences between the blocks. Subject-specific effects were then entered into second-level, random effects analyses."

We chose three ROIs based on this network: the hippocampus as the core of this network, the AnG as a lateral parietal ROI, as well as the precuneus as a medial parietal ROI. Each of these regions has previously been linked with one or other of the components of memory retrieval tested in the current study. Hippocampus and AnG have been associated with objective recollection success (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kim, 2010</a>), with some evidence for a dissociation in the\u00a0function of these regions (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vilberg and Rugg, 2012</a>). AnG was of specific interest in the current study as previous work indicates that this area might represent individual memories (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bonnici et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kuhl and Chun, 2014</a>) and has been implicated in subjective aspects of retrieval (<a href=\"#bib40\">Simons et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yazar et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kuhl and Chun, 2014</a>). Lastly, the precuneus has been associated with vivid memory retrieval (<a href=\"#bib42\">St-Laurent et al., 2015</a>) and processes associated with mental imagery (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fletcher et al., 1995</a>). Within each of our ROIs, we focused on three contrasts of interest: successful vs. unsuccessful retrieval, positive correlation with precision, using a parametric modulator of response precision for successfully retrieved trials, and positive correlation with vividness, using a parametric modulator of vividness ratings during vividness judgment trials. ROIs were generated using the Wake Forest University (WFU) pick atlas, with anatomical masks for the three ROIs selected from the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas. Small-volume correction at a family-wise error (FWE) corrected threshold of p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05 was applied when assessing the statistical significance of the ROI results."

During each encoding phase, 6 scenes each containing 3 objects were presented for study. After this phase, a scene was presented without the objects and participants were first asked about the vividness of remembering the 4 objects associated with each scene. They were then asked to recover details about 2 of the 3 previously presented objects in a continuous manner. Using retrieval success, continuous measure of precision and vividness seemed to correlate with three distinct regions of the core recollection network: hippocampus for success, angular gyrus for precision and precuneus for vividness. The attempt is lauded and the data make a nice contribution to the literature. Questions and concerns about the analytic approach however require consideration. Also, do these components differentiate during encoding as well or are these solely seen at retrieval?"

This is an interesting analysis as the categorical way of defining the data pulls out hippocampus (consistent with prior work) while the continuous measure pulls out angular gyrus. Finally, precuneus appear sensitive to the vividness of retrieval as assessed prior to any source questions. It looks like both hippocampus and angular gyrus are sensitive to success but only angular gyrus shows a continuous effect, which is a nice new finding."

Using retrieval success, continuous measure of precision and vividness seemed to correlate with three distinct regions of the core recollection network: hippocampus for success, angular gyrus for precision and precuneus for vividness.

While it is fairly straightforward to derive a measure of later retrieval success (x out of 6 items were successfully remembered), it is not clear how a measure of precision (for an entire encoding display) should be derived that is independent of retrieval success. Future studies would need to use separate encoding events that each have a single subsequent precision measure to address this question. Therefore, the present data cannot answer whether hippocampus tracks subsequent <i>precision</i> of an encoded item, but, following the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we were able to test whether hippocampus tracks the number of subsequently remembered (successful retrieval) features. In contrast to the finding described by the reviewer above, we did not find in our data that hippocampal activity during encoding tracked the number of features subsequently recalled. As the main focus of the current study was on retrieval processes, and the current design does not allow us to adequately test the involvement of all three processes during encoding, we have refrained from addressing the question of dissociable encoding processes in the paper."

For all three features, response space was divided into 360 increments around the circle, so that subjects could change the features in an effectively continuous manner when moving around the wheel. All three features were selected from continuous space when originally generating the displays, such that any colour/orientation/location value was possible across displays. The only restriction for the generation of the displays was that <i>within any one display</i> the colours/orientations/location of the three objects would be 62.04 degrees apart. This was the minimum distance in the location feature that would ensure that objects would not physically overlap. We applied the same restriction to the other two features for consistency. However, this restriction was only applied <i>within</i> any one display; across displays all colours, orientations and locations were possible.

In our earlier analysis where we report ROI results looking for activated voxels with small volume correction, we only found hippocampus to respond significantly to retrieval success, AnG to respond significantly to precision, and precuneus to respond significantly to vividness. Therefore, an exclusive masking procedure (e.g., of AnG activity with the retrieval success contrast) would not reveal any significant voxels as each ROI only showed significant activity for one contrast of interest. Furthermore, an exclusive masking procedure similarly would not be able to reveal a difference in the magnitude of activation between contrasts; only a difference in the location of activity. We therefore agree that we cannot make the firm conclusion that AnG responds <i>more</i> to precision than to retrieval success, and take care in the manuscript only to report that there is a dissociation between ROIs and contrasts, as shown by the interactions."

Using a paradigm that allowed the authors to dissociate three putative components (i.e., retrieval success, precision and vividness) associated with episodic retrieval, the authors reported that distinct regions of the recollection network are preferentially involved in retrieval success, retrieval precision, and subjective vividness of episodic memories. Results from this study are in line with emerging behavioral evidence, which suggests that episodic recollection may consist of separable components (e.g., retrieval success and precision). The current results thus provide additional neural evidence for these behavioral observations, and shed lights to the functional contributions of distinct brain regions within the recollection network to episodic retrieval. The current report is well written and will generate broad interest in the memory research community. We only have a few comments and questions:</i> "

We believe that one of the strengths of the current approach compared to previous studies is that those studies did not try to tease apart distinct components of memory retrieval such as vividness and retrieval success. As can be seen from the regression analyses, these components are indeed clearly dissociable. By modelling the three contrasts (retrieval success, vividness, and precision) in the same GLM, the current study ensured that they accounted for independent sources of variance, thereby making it possible to discriminate the effects of different components of the retrieval process in a manner that previous studies could not. Therefore, it is possible that previous studies reporting vividness effects in hippocampus may have been picking up on a response to retrieval success. In this sense, we see our results not as conflicting with previous results, but rather they help elucidate what might be driving vividness effects in hippocampus if they are observed. We have included this reasoning at several points in the Discussion of the revised manuscript."

Therefore, it could be argued that the relatively larger range of values in the vividness regressor should have increased (and not limited) our ability to detect vividness effects in hippocampus if they existed, compared to, for example, retrieval success effects. Moreover, if a difference in the range of values affected our ability to detect a correlation between neural activity and vividness ratings, we would have no reason to predict that precuneus and not hippocampus would correlate with vividness."

Our ROIs were chosen <i>a priori</i> for a variety of reasons which we now highlight more clearly in the manuscript text (see subsection \u201cRegions and Contrasts of Interest\u201d). In short, the precuneus was chosen, firstly, due to its involvement in mental imagery (Fletcher et al., 1995), as we expected that mental imagery might be a central, dissociable component part of memory retrieval, influencing particularly the vividness with which memories are experienced. Moreover, the current study was in part inspired by the memory deficits observed in patients with parietal lesions. While lateral parietal lesions are often the focus of this neuropsychological work, many of the patients in the literature likely have damage extending to broader parietal areas including the precuneus (Berryhill et al., 2007). In order to clearly understand parietal memory effects, we therefore wanted to include this medial parietal region in addition to lateral cortex. Of note we chose a fairly broad precuneus ROI: the AAL precuneus mask used in the current study includes large parts of retrosplenial cortex as well (Rolls et al. (2015), though the reviewer is correct in that it does not include posterior cingulate cortex."

From the whole brain analysis, it can indeed be seen that a region in ventral mPFC appears to be active for the retrieval success contrast, at least at the very liberal threshold used in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. However, our approach focused primarily on the mentioned more posterior regions, as they have been more directly linked to the processes (retrieval success, imagery, construction and vividness) that we were trying to dissociate. While our current approach focuses on the three a priori selected ROIs, we included the exploratory whole brain analysis to obtain a better understanding of processes that might be supported by other nodes in the broader retrieval network. We believe that this combination of a small number of pre-selected ROIs together with a whole brain analysis provides an ideal combination of hypothesis driven and exploratory analyses."

The revised manuscript now includes several changes in the Discussion that address these interesting points in more detail. Our interpretation is that AnG may support the representation of retrieved information, the precision of which is utilised by the precuneus in the service of vividness judgements. Regarding the sentence in the Discussion of the original manuscript, we agree that our wording was not sufficiently clear. Our intention was to argue that the (possibly indirect) link between diminished vividness reports and (lateral) parietal lesions that has been drawn from patient studies might be caused by two factors: firstly, lesions are often not selective to lateral parietal areas, and include medial parietal areas such as precuneus as well; secondly, as medial and lateral parietal areas are heavily connected, damage to lateral parietal areas might disrupt input from these areas to precuneus, which could result in reduced vividness reports."
