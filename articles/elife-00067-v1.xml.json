Using single molecule fluorescence imaging tools with high spatiotemporal resolution we characterized the encounter complex between the RecA filament and dsDNA. We present evidence in support of the \u2018sliding model\u2019 wherein a RecA filament diffuses along a dsDNA track. We further show that homology can be detected during sliding. Sliding occurs with a diffusion coefficient of approximately 8000 bp<sup>2</sup>/s allowing the filament to sample several hundred base pairs before dissociation. Modeling suggests that sliding can accelerate homology search by as much as 200 fold. Homology recognition can occur for as few as 6 nt of complementary basepairs with the recognition efficiency increasing for higher complementarity. Our data represents the first example of a DNA bound multi-protein complex which can slide along another DNA to facilitate target search."

Using single molecule fluorescence imaging tools with high spatiotemporal resolution we characterized the encounter complex between the RecA filament and dsDNA. We present evidence in support of the \u2018sliding model\u2019 wherein a RecA filament diffuses along a dsDNA track. We further show that homology can be detected during sliding. Sliding occurs with a diffusion coefficient of approximately 8000 bp<sup>2</sup>/s allowing the filament to sample several hundred base pairs before dissociation. Modeling suggests that sliding can accelerate homology search by as much as 200 fold. Homology recognition can occur for as few as 6 nt of complementary basepairs with the recognition efficiency increasing for higher complementarity. Our data represents the first example of a DNA bound multi-protein complex which can slide along another DNA to facilitate target search."

High-resolution fluorescent imaging reveals that the RecA filament is able to sample several hundred base pairs before the filament dissociates from the DNA and rebinds at a different location. The sliding was largely driven by electrostatic interactions between the RecA filament and the double-stranded DNA, and the filament was capable of identifying matching sequences that contained as few as six matching bases."

Homologous recombination is one of the pathways involved in double strand break repair (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cox et al., 2000</a>). An important step in homologous recombination is the reciprocal exchange of basepairs between complementary DNA molecules during a reaction called strand exchange, which is catalyzed by RecA in <i>E. coli</i>. Homologs of RecA, Rad51 and Dmc1 in eukaryotes and RadA in archaea, carry out similar functions during DNA repair underscoring the central role of proteins catalyzing strand exchange across all forms of life (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bianco et al., 1998</a>)."

Pre-synapsis involves the assembly of RecA monomers on single stranded (ss) DNA in the presence of ATP with a stoichiometry of 3 nt per monomer (<a href=\"#bib12\">Di Capua et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dombroski et al., 1983</a>). RecA forms a filament which stretches the ssDNA to a length of 1.5 times the length of B-form DNA (<a href=\"#bib34\">Stasiak et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dunn et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Stasiak and Egelman, 1986</a>). During synapsis, the RecA filament finds a homologous double stranded (ds) DNA and catalyzes the exchange of complementary base pairs to form a new heteroduplex product. Subsequently, branch migration mediates the extension of the heteroduplex product (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cox and Lehman, 1981</a>)."

A RecA filament has to rapidly and accurately find a homologous sequence in the presence of a vast excess of non-homologous dsDNA. The multivalent nature of the RecA filament enables it to sustain contact with a long dsDNA while allowing for frequent dissociation events that permits rapid sampling of different segments of the DNA, thus facilitating homology search (<a href=\"#bib15\">Forget and Kowalczykowski, 2012</a>). Experiments involving the mechanical manipulation of the incoming dsDNA upon binding to the RecA filament identified structural intermediates which facilitate homology recognition and provided insight into mechanisms by which RecA can discriminate between homologous and non-homologous DNA sequences (<a href=\"#bib10\">Danilowicz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">De Vlaminck et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Peacock-Villada et al., 2012</a>). However, random 3D collision between a RecA filament and the dsDNA even when aided by intersegmental transfer is unlikely to result in precise alignment of matching sequences. For this reason, RecA filament sliding on dsDNA, even over a short distance range of ten to hundreds of bp would significantly accelerate the search for homology. Although many proteins are now known to diffuse along the DNA via 1D sliding (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blainey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gorman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bonnet et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Roy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>) RecA filament diffusion on DNA has not been observed before and in fact an early study ruled out a role for long range (approximately several kb) 1D sliding during homology search (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adzuma, 1998</a>). Here, we utilized the high spatio-temporal resolution of single molecule FRET (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ha et al., 1996</a>) to examine the possibility of RecA filament sliding during homology search."

Furthermore, by using sequences with short stretches of homology, we could monitor repeated events of homology recognition and disengagement in real time without full dissociation of RecA filament from dsDNA. RecA-mediated homology search is the first example of a DNA bound multi protein complex which can slide on another DNA during target search process. It may also serve as a canonical example for other proteins (e.g., telomerase and Argonaute) which are bound to nucleic acid sequences that act as \u2018guide\u2019 strands conferring target site specificity."

After docking, we observed large and rapid fluctuations in FRET detected as anti-correlated changes of donor and acceptor intensities. The FRET fluctuations are indicative of extensive distance changes between the donor on the dsDNA and the acceptor on the RecA/ssDNA filament. Single molecule time traces show multiple dsDNA binding and dissociation events to the same filament because the observed interactions are transient without forming a stable product (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The lifetime of the binding events is exponentially distributed with an average lifetime of 3.5 s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Filaments formed with ATP displayed similar FRET fluctuations upon docking of non-homologous dsDNA and exhibit comparable dissociation times (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>).

The first involves limited unwinding of the dsDNA (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bianchi et al., 1985</a>) by the RecA filament resulting in separation of the duplex ends. Repeated melting and annealing transitions at the labeled end of the dsDNA could in principle result in FRET fluctuations. We tested this possibility using a dsDNA (<i>L</i><sub>dsDNA</sub> = 39 bp) labeled at one duplex end (donor and acceptor fluorophores on the two opposing strands) so that local melting would cause a FRET decrease and vice versa. When the dsDNA docks to an unlabeled RecA filament immobilized on the surface, we observed stable high FRET (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) suggesting that separation of the duplex ends is not the source of FRET fluctuations described in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>."

To quantify the time scale of FRET fluctuations, we determined cross-correlation of the donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities for four different filament lengths (<i>L</i><sub>filament</sub> = 21, 39, 69 and 99 nt) and a single length of non-homologous dsDNA (<i>L</i><sub>dsDNA</sub> = 39 bp). The average cross correlation time increased with increasing filament lengths (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), supporting the 1D sliding model. Furthermore, the histogram of FRET efficiencies (<i>E</i>) shifted towards lower FRET values for increasing filament lengths (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This observation also supports the 1D sliding model because the two fluorophores would spend a smaller fraction of time in close proximity if the filament is longer. To estimate the diffusion coefficient of the 1D sliding process, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of dsDNA diffusing along a RecA filament (\u2018Experimental procedures\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Given its large persistence length of about 800 nm (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hegner et al., 1999</a>), we treated the RecA filament as a rigid rod. We then simulated time traces of donor and acceptor intensities of dsDNA bound to RecA filament of various lengths using different pre-assigned diffusion coefficients (<i>D</i><sub>slide</sub>) and then calculated the average cross correlation times for each case. By comparing the simulation results with the experimental data we estimated the diffusion constant <i>D</i><sub>slide</sub> for 1D sliding of dsDNA relative to the RecA filament to be approximately 0.9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup> \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s or 7700 bp<sup>2</sup>/s. Additionally the time scale of sliding (as measured by the cross correlation time) does not change as a function of sodium or magnesium ion concentrations in solution while the sliding time scale increases twofold when ATP\u03b3S is replaced by ATP (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B</a>). However, the use of ATP as a co-factor, especially in experiments involving short ssDNA substrates is complicated by the dissociation of RecA monomers from the ssDNA ends leading to filament instabilities which could potentially disrupt sliding along the RecA filament track."

Here, the immobilized RecA filament is labeled with two different acceptor fluorophores, Cy5 at the ssDNA/dsDNA junction and Cy7 in the middle of the ssDNA embedded within the RecA filament (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The two acceptors are separated by 33 nt, which upon RecA binding results in a large separation and negligible FRET between them (<a href=\"#bib24\">Joo et al., 2006</a>). The sliding model predicts anticorrelated changes between the two FRET efficiencies, one between Cy3 and Cy5 (<i>E</i><sub>Cy3-Cy5</sub>) and the other between Cy3 and Cy7 (<i>E</i><sub>Cy3-Cy7</sub>) because when Cy3 on the dsDNA approaches Cy5, it should move away from Cy7 and vice versa. We observed large and rapid fluctuations in FRET from Cy3 to Cy5 (<i>E</i><sub>Cy3-Cy5</sub>) and FRET from Cy3 to Cy7 (<i>E</i><sub>Cy3-Cy7</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, bottom panel). Consistent with the sliding model, the time trace of <i>E</i><sub>Cy3-Cy5</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>Cy3-Cy7</sub> exhibits anticorrelation between the two FRET efficiencies. The timescale of fluctuations determined from the cross-correlation of the two FRET efficiencies (<i>T</i><sub>xcorr-3color</sub> = 0.04 s) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) is similar to that measured using the two color assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The scatter plot of <i>E</i><sub>Cy3-Cy5</sub> vs <i>E</i><sub>Cy3-Cy7</sub> and calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficient for the two FRET efficiencies (<i>r</i><sub>pearson</sub> <i>=</i> \u22120.6) provide further support for a negative correlation between <i>E</i><sub>Cy3-Cy5</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>Cy3-Cy7</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

To answer this question, we embedded two repeats of an identical sequence at positions HS1 and HS2 within an otherwise non-homologous ssDNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). If the target dsDNA contains base pairs which are homologous to the short repeat sequence, it may be possible to observe back and forth sliding events between the two homology sites (HS1 and HS2) without full dissociation of the dsDNA from the RecA filament. Such an observation would indicate that RecA filament sliding allows for homology recognition and base pairing. In all cases, HS1 and HS2 are complementary to a sequence in close proximity to the donor labeled end of the target dsDNA and the location and spacing between the two homology sites were chosen to be within a FRET sensitive regime (approximately 20\u201380 \u00c5)."

We then introduced two identical sequences of length, <i>L</i><sub>h</sub> = 5 nt, at HS1 and HS2 positions which are complementary to a 5 bp sequence within the target dsDNA (<i>L</i><sub>dsDNA</sub> = 39 bp). Binding of the dsDNA to the RecA filament formed on the ssDNA with the two 5 nt repeats displayed rapid FRET fluctuations across a broad range of FRET values (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,E</a>) similar to that observed using a poly-T DNA sequence (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, when we increased the length of homology at HS1 and HS2 by a single nucleotide to <i>L</i><sub>h</sub> = 6 nt, single molecule time traces displayed transitions between discrete FRET states (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The same trend was observed upon further increasing the homology length to <i>L</i><sub>h</sub> = 7 nt (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

                                "text": "In order to confirm that the observed FRET peaks arise from base pairing and recognition at specific homology sites, we analyzed different ssDNA sequences containing only one of the two 6 nt homology sites (HS1 or HS2) and obtained a distinct FRET peak at either approximately 0.9 or 0.5, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,I</a>). Thus, we assigned the highest FRET state (approximately 0.9) to homology recognition and base pairing at HS1 and the mid FRET state (approximately 0.5) to homology recognition and base pairing at HS2. The lowest FRET state, <i>E</i> \u223c 0.1, is likely to correspond to dsDNA sliding outside the boundary of HS1 and HS2 in a FRET insensitive regime. Given that this location lacks stable base pairing interactions, we referred to the low FRET state as the non-homologous state (NH). Although the gap between HS1 and HS2 is 5 nt, it is noteworthy that the total distance traversed by dsDNA to exhibit complete basepairing is (L<sub>h</sub> + 5) nt. Thus, for the smallest L<sub>h</sub> of 6 nt, this translates to a distance of approximately 50 \u01fa (11 nt \u00d7 3.4 \u01fa \u00d7 1.5). Given the rapid movements of the dsDNA between adjacent homology sites and the fact that both the dsDNA and RecA filament are stiff at the length scales of our experiments, we cannot think of mechanisms other than sliding to explain the observed transitions. We used a statistical approach based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis to make unbiased assignments of the various FRET states present within each single molecule time trace. The FRET transitions obtained from HMM analysis were then plotted in the form of a transition density plot (TDP) which is a 2D histogram reflecting the frequency of transitions between the various FRET states. For <i>L</i><sub>h</sub> = 6 nt, the TDP obtained from 236 molecules exhibiting 13,020 transitions displays three distinct FRET states, <i>E</i> \u223c 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). Furthermore, the HMM/TDP analysis gave the transition rates and the number of transitions between the different FRET states. The rate of departing HS1 or HS2 was threefold lower than that of leaving NH, showing that even 6 bp homology can significantly stabilize joint molecule formation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L</a>). Similarly, we fitted the data for L<sub>h</sub> = 7 nt using HMM analysis (191 molecules, 3819 transitions) and extracted the transition rates and number of transitions from the resulting TDP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a>). As expected, we observed a slower rate of leaving HS1 and HS2 for L<sub>h</sub> = 7 nt compared to L<sub>h</sub> = 6 nt (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L</a>). Also, the dissociation rate of dsDNA bound to HS1 was higher than that of dsDNA bound to HS2 possibly because HS1 is located at the filament end where the terminal RecA monomer at the ssDNA\u2013dsDNA junction binds with altered kinetics (<a href=\"#bib24\">Joo et al., 2006</a>) as opposed to HS2 which is embedded within the RecA filament and benefits from complementary basepairing with the homology site and stabilizing interactions with neighboring RecA monomers."

Homology recognition and base pairing of dsDNA at either HS1 or HS2 during sliding is a stochastic process. For a dsDNA initially bound to a non-homologous site (NH), the efficiency with which the first homology site the dsDNA encounters, HS2, is recognized before the more distant homology site, HS1, is recognized is given by,"

In this hypothetical model, RecA filaments can bind non-specifically to DNA but do not slide (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Though, we do not know the exact microscopic rate constants which determine the binding probability of the RecA filament to the target site (p<sub>bind</sub>), we can estimate that even for a recognition probability as low as approximately 1%, sliding leads to a rate enhancement in homology search by approximately 200-fold. If no sliding is allowed and homology must be recognized via fortuitous 3D contact that aligns the dsDNA and filament in perfect registry, homology recognition would be about two orders of magnitude slower. Therefore, 1D sliding combined with intersegmental transfer proposed by <a href=\"#bib15\">Forget and Kowalcyzkowski (2012</a>) can dramatically accelerate homology search."

Although our experimental scheme cannot probe for small and dynamic off-axis motions between the RecA filament and dsDNA, we can at least rule out the extreme possibility of \u2018dsDNA flipping\u2019 in which case the dsDNA may undergo a 180\u00b0 change in orientation while remaining bound to the RecA filament (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Therefore, a dsDNA that binds to a RecA filament in the wrong orientation cannot establish the correct orientation required for homology recognition and basepairing without full dissociation and rebinding."

Our results showed that as few as 6 nt of complementary base pairs are sufficient to act as the unit of homology recognition for RecA mediated homology search. It is noteworthy that recognition of a homology site is a stochastic process and the efficiency of homology recognition by the RecA filament depends on the length of homology which is encountered at a particular site. Furthermore, we show that adding even a single nucleotide to the minimum recognition unit of 6 nt improves recognition efficiency by approximately 1.5-fold."

While intersegmental transfer serves to bring non-contiguous segments of dsDNA close to each other, 1D sliding during homology search could help RecA reorganize the initial synaptic complex in <i>cis</i> without the need for a RecA filament to fully dissociate and rebind to a nearby homology site located within a short distance (up to few hundred base pairs). Given the ability of the RecA filament to slide between nearby homology sites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), sliding could serve as a mechanism to rapidly scan neighboring sequences for the existence of an optimal seed sequence from which base pair propagation and heteroduplex extension reactions can proceed. An earlier report demonstrated sliding of Rad51 oligomers (not a Rad51 filament bound to ssDNA) without any clear functional role attributed to the observed sliding activity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Graneli et al., 2006</a>). Because of significant structural and functional similarities between RecA and Rad51 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Conway et al., 2004</a>), it is likely that sliding might also play a role in homology search mediated by Rad51."

Although this is very unlikely <i>in vivo</i> considering the presence of kilobase long filaments and DNA in the cell, previous single molecule FRET measurements reported the flipping of protein orientation on DNA without full dissociation (Abbondanzieri et al., 2008). Therefore, we performed control experiments to test the possibility that short dsDNA may flip its orientation while remaining bound to the RecA filament. We used the ssDNA substrate that contains two 8 nt homology sites embedded in poly(dT) \u2013 the same DNA we used to demonstrate the existence of two stable positions that are interchanging only infrequently (Figure 4\u2013Figure Supplement 2). If you use a dsDNA with the 8 nt homology but with the donor attached at the opposite end of the duplex DNA, we observe rapid fluctuations over a broad range of FRET values (new Figure 4\u2013Figure Supplement 4A, B), identical to what\u2019s observed if the ssDNA is made only of poly(dT) (new Figure 4\u2013Figure Supplement 4C, D). The rapid fluctuations indicate the lack of homology recognition. This is likely because when the dsDNA binds to the RecA filament with the wrong orientation, it cannot flip its orientation to find the homology sites (HS1 and HS2). If flipping can occur while the dsDNA is bound to the RecA filament we would have observed stable low FRET states that can transit to the rapidly fluctuating phase and back. For this construct, when the dsDNA binds to the filament in the correct orientation, where the unlabeled homologous end is in close proximity to the acceptor, FRET stays low and these events were not included in the histogram shown in Figure 4\u2013Figure Supplement 4B. We have revised the manuscript to formally discuss the possibility of flipping in the Discussion section:"
