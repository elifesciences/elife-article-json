Even though class switching is essential for mounting a protective response to pathogens, the in vivo patterns and lineage characteristics of antibody class switching have remained uncharacterized in living humans. Here we comprehensively measured the landscape of antibody class switching in human adult twins using antibody repertoire sequencing. The map identifies how antibodies of every class are created and delineates a two-tiered hierarchy of class switch pathways. Using somatic hypermutations as a molecular clock, we discovered that closely related B cells often switch to the same class, but lose coherence as somatic mutations accumulate. Such correlations between closely related cells exist when purified B cells class switch in vitro, suggesting that class switch recombination is directed toward specific isotypes by a cell-autonomous imprinted state."

Even though class switching is essential for mounting a protective response to pathogens, the in vivo patterns and lineage characteristics of antibody class switching have remained uncharacterized in living humans. Here we comprehensively measured the landscape of antibody class switching in human adult twins using antibody repertoire sequencing. The map identifies how antibodies of every class are created and delineates a two-tiered hierarchy of class switch pathways. Using somatic hypermutations as a molecular clock, we discovered that closely related B cells often switch to the same class, but lose coherence as somatic mutations accumulate. Such correlations between closely related cells exist when purified B cells class switch in vitro, suggesting that class switch recombination is directed toward specific isotypes by a cell-autonomous imprinted state."

The variable regions of antibodies have been the subject of intense study due to their central role in determining the amazing breadth of molecular recognition in the antibody repertoire. However, the constant regions of antibodies also display quite dynamic behavior through the phenomenon of class switching, which is also known as isotype switching. Different classes of antibodies with distinct Fc domains mediate specialized effector functions, including activation of complement, phagocytosis, cytotoxicity, and release of inflammatory mediators (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kindt et al., 2007</a>). The diversification of antibody functionality via class switching is essential for mounting a protective response to different pathogens. Conversely, dysregulation of antibody class switching has been implicated in autoimmune diseases, including allergic hypersensitivity (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sugai et al., 2003</a>), rheumatoid arthritis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Humby et al., 2009</a>), systemic lupus erythematosus (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bubier et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mietzner et al., 2008</a>), IgG4-related disease (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stone et al., 2012</a>), and hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (<a href=\"#bib29\">Minegishi, 2009</a>)."

After antigen encounter, IgM+ and IgD+ na\u00efve B cells can switch to expression of activated classes IgG, IgA, and IgE via genomic recombination of the immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region locus. Much of current knowledge about the mechanisms of class switching is derived from the analysis of B cells induced to undergo class switch recombination (CSR) in vitro.

These signals likely originate from cognate Th cells and dendritic cells in vivo. Cytokine stimulation induces transcription and splicing of 'germline' transcripts from the switch region of the particular IGHC locus that is participating in CSR (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lorenz et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Stavnezer-Nordgren and Sirlin, 1986</a>).

Sequencing libraries were prepared of a ~430\u2013480 bp fragment of the IGH gene using total RNA from peripheral blood B cells drawn from each subject. Libraries were sequenced with 300 bp paired-end reads on the Illumina Miseq platform. Individual RNA molecules were labeled with unique molecular barcodes during library preparation, enabling highly accurate measurement of genetic diversity by using a consensus read approach to correct PCR and sequencing errors (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Vollmers et al., 2013</a>). On average, ~261,000 raw reads were obtained from each individual at each time point, representing ~154,000 unique sequences (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Molecular barcodes were used to enumerate unique sequences and identify distinct clones. Sequencing reads covered ~100 bp of the constant region, making it possible to determine antibody class and resolve subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, and IgA2) with high accuracy. Across individuals, the most abundant class was IgM (75%), followed by IgG1 (10%) and IgA1 (8%) (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). For 14 of 22 subjects, the measurement was repeated 28 days after the initial sample as a biological replicate (Bio. Rep.). To test the robustness of these measurements, we used the Jensen-Shannon distance as a measure of similarity between distributions of antibody class abundance. As expected, the class distributions are essentially the same across replicates in nearly every subject (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A and B</a>). Furthermore, V gene usage is highly similar across biological replicates (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>)."

To study class switching after B cell activation, we developed an approach for reconstructing the clonal history of antibody lineages by using the information contained in the accumulation of somatic mutations as a molecular clock, much as ribosomal 16S sequences are used to study the evolutionary relationships of life on earth. We identified sequences belonging to the same clonal lineage as those sharing a variable (V) and joining (J) gene combination, CDR3 length, and \u226595% sequence identity in both the CDR3 and the rest of the variable region with at least one other member of the lineage (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>, and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods).

This provides a constraint on ancestry that we incorporated into our algorithm for clonal history reconstruction: for a sequence belonging to a given class, only sequences of upstream classes can be ancestors."

As expected, somatic mutations accumulate as one moves from the germline sequence toward the leaves of the trees (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6A</a>). We note that PCR and sequencing errors rarely give rise to sequences having different classes and therefore contribute minimally to error in measuring class switching. Because these errors terminate branches of the tree, they also do not affect our analysis of mutation accumulation and correlations in class switching patterns. Unlike previous approaches (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barak et al., 2008</a>), our tree reconstruction approach enables direct measurement of class switching events in clonal lineages which are supported by observed sequences without the need to infer mutations or ancestral isotype states. The inference process is challenging and indirect due to the complex mutational spectrum of somatic hypermutation."

Since every molecule has a unique barcode associated with it, we are able to prove that these sequences are not due to PCR recombination artifacts (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These sequence pairs arose from CSR without intervening hypermutation events and enable analysis of class switching rates on a subset of the data without the need for lineage identification or tree construction. When we conducted our analysis using only these sequences, we found that the patterns of class switching correlate extremely well with the landscape measured across the entire repertoire, showing that the full lineage tree approach faithfully measures class switching patterns (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). We further confirmed that the patterns of class switching measured using only sequences that inherited all of the germline mutations from their immediate ancestor are highly similar to those measured using the full lineage tree approach (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that artifacts arising from imperfect sampling of ancestral sequences have not distorted our measurement. In addition, patterns of class switching measured using only sequences supported by at least three sequencing reads are highly similar to those measured using the full lineage tree approach, suggesting that PCR and sequencing error have not substantially distorted our measurement (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Finally, we confirmed that patterns of class switching could not simply be explained by random switching in proportion to class abundance. After shuffling the classes of parent-child sequence pairs, the hierarchical class switching patterns that we observed vanished (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

The dominant class switch pathway leads from IgM/IgD to IgG1 or IgA1. Specifically, IgM switched most commonly to IgG1, IgA1, and IgG2, which together account for ~85% of switches from IgM. Direct switches from IgM to downstream classes (IgG4, IgE, or IgA2) were rare (~14%). Instead, downstream classes are predominantly produced via indirect switches (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), most often through IgG1 or IgA1 in a secondary hierarchy of pathways. For example, IgG1 frequently switched to IgA1 or IgG2, which together account for ~92% of switches from IgG1, but rarely switched directly to IgG4 or IgA2. Most IgA2 was produced by subsequent switches from IgA1 or IgG2 (~65%), instead of directly from IgG1. We also saw that IgG3 is more likely to switch to IgG1/2 (~87%) rather than IgA1/2, suggesting that IgG3 lies along a pathway for specific generation of IgG antibodies. These results delineate the class switch pathways that give rise to specific antibody classes. The class switching landscape and the penetrance of direct and indirect switches were highly reproducible across the\u00a0biological replicates, which were separated by 28 days (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s8\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 8B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s9\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 9</a>), confirming the robustness of our measurements and suggesting that the landscape is a temporally invariant feature of the healthy human immune system."

For example, the tempo of class switching within activated B cell lineages has not been measured. Motivated by this, we used somatic mutations as a molecular clock to measure the rate of CSR between na\u00efve and activated classes within clonal lineages. We searched the clonal lineage trees for motifs consisting of multiple sequences sharing the same class that accumulated mutations prior to a class switch event (<a href=\"#fig2s11\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 11A</a>).

Among IgM/IgD sequences, the average number of mutations accumulated in the variable region prior to CSR is 4.1 \u00b1 6.7 (mean \u00b1 s.d.). In contrast, only 2.5 \u00b1 4.3 mutations accumulate in sequences of activated classes prior to further CSR (<a href=\"#fig2s11\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 11B and C</a>; p = 1.8 \u00d7 10<sup>\u201345</sup> and 1.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u201312</sup> for Samples and Bio. Rep. respectively; Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided). We found that the distributions of mutations accumulated prior to CSR were well fit by an exponential distribution, suggesting that CSR is a memory-less process with respect to somatic mutation and allowing us to estimate rates of CSR (<a href=\"#fig2s11\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 11E</a>). We found that the rate constants of class switching from IgM/IgD to activated classes were ~0.37 mutation<sup>-1</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). By contrast, the rate constants of switching between activated classes were ~0.60 mutation<sup>-1</sup> (p &lt; 1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20134</sup>; Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided). These patterns were robustly observed across biological replicates (<a href=\"#fig2s11\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 11D</a>). Because class switching can be initiated from mutated IgM memory cells for which we may have failed to detect na\u00efve progenitors, our measurements of the number of mutations accumulated in IgM sequences prior to class switching are likely an underestimate, supporting an argument for differences in the rate of CSR between na\u00efve and activated classes. Thus, our results suggest that activated B cells which have already undergone class switching tend to rapidly undergo further class switching, as measured by the clock of somatic hypermutation."

We further required that each sequence inherit all of the somatic mutations present in its ancestor, yielding ~40,000 pairs of sequences for this analysis. We binned these sequence pairs by their mutational distance from the common progenitor, revealing that the pairs spanned a broad spectrum of relatedness (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). For each level of relatedness (bin), we calculated the probability that both sequences in a pair switched to the same class. To quantify the strength of concordance, we used Yule\u2019s Q, which measures the agreement between pairs of sequences. Yule\u2019s Q ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating that both sequences always switched to the same class (perfect agreement), -1 indicating that the two sequences always switched to different classes (perfect disagreement), and 0 indicating no correlation between the fates of sequences in a pair."

The most closely related cells, separated by \u22642 mutations from their common progenitor, had a very significant tendency to switch to the same class, in contrast to unrelated pairs of cells which were obtained by shuffling (p values ranging from 6 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20135</sup> to 1.1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u2013186</sup>; <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). When we examined pairs of cells that were less closely related (as measured by mutations from their common progenitor), we found that the concordance in class switch fates dissipated as somatic mutations accumulated, becoming indistinguishable from unrelated cells after ~10 somatic mutations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These findings were corroborated by examining the probability distributions of class switch fate conditioned upon the fate of a closely related cell: closely related cells exhibit probability distributions that are strongly biased toward the same class switch fate, and the bias dissipates as somatic mutations accumulate (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Importantly, we found that mutational distances (i.e. branch lengths) are not associated with particular switching events (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), and that mutational distances among related sequences are not correlated (<a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7</a>), indicating that correlations in switch fate are not due to differential sampling of lineages. These findings demonstrate that class switch decisions are coordinated within clonal lineages of B cells in living humans and that this coordination dissipates at large genealogical distances within a lineage."

Alternatively, sister cells might share an imprinted state, which is transmitted from a common progenitor and directs CSR toward specific isotypes in a cell-autonomous fashion. To discriminate between these models and test whether cellular interactions are necessary to generate correlations between class switch fates of sibling cells, we measured the class switch behavior of purified primary human B cells stimulated with cytokines in culture. We purified CD19+ IgM+ B cells from whole blood (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and cultured them in the presence of multimeric CD40 ligand (CD40L), IL-4, and IL-10 for 8 days, then prepared sequencing libraries of the IGH locus. The purified B cells were 99.6% CD19+ (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and sequencing of the IgM+ cells used to initiate the culture revealed that 97% of the sequences were IgM/IgD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). During culture, the cells proliferated and underwent class switching to IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgA1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). After reconstructing the histories of clonal lineages, we identified ~1900 pairs of IgM/IgD sequences sharing a common progenitor that subsequently underwent class switching."

Since sequences having more somatic mutations were exceedingly rare (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), it was not possible to examine the dissipation of concordance as somatic mutations accumulated. Importantly, no pairs of sequences sharing a common progenitor that subsequently underwent class switching were detected in the IgM+ B cell populations that initiated the culture, confirming that imperfect IgM+ B cell purification cannot account for the class switches detected after culturing. These results demonstrate that coordination of class switch decisions in clonal lineages of B cells is not dependent upon the in vivo environment and interactions with cognate cells, but rather seems to be an autonomous property of purified B cells. This finding suggests that CSR is directed toward specific isotypes by an imprinted state, which is transmitted from a common progenitor to sister cells."

The data reveal that pathways of CSR are organized into two tiers: (1) na\u00efve classes (IgM/IgD) switch predominantly to proximal classes such as IgG3, IgG1, or IgA1, and (2) proximal classes may subsequently switch to distal classes, such as IgG2, IgG4, or IgA2. IgG1 and IgA1 seem to be central intermediates linking na\u00efve to distal classes. This pattern is evident from (1) the high probability of switching from na\u00efve to proximal classes together with the low probability of switching directly from na\u00efve to distal classes, and (2) observations of frequent sequential switches via IgG3, IgG1, and IgA1 intermediates. This hierarchy mirrors the linear geometry of the IGH constant region loci on chromosome 14, suggesting that chromosomal structure or topology influences CSR. Consistent with this, previous studies which showed that mouse B cells stimulated in vitro with CD40L and IL-4 switched to IgG1 with high frequency after three divisions, while switching to the downstream classes IgE and IgG2a increased after five or six divisions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hasbold et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hodgkin et al., 1996</a>). A previous study on human populations reported increasing levels of point mutation in progressively further downstream IgG subclasses, supporting sequential class switching (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jackson et al., 2014b</a>). This study also suggested the existence of a preferential switch pathway from IgG2 to IgA2 based on evidence of stronger antigen-driven selection in IgA2 than IgA1 sequences, which is consistent with our results. Our examination of clonal histories of B cell lineages with mixed isotypes provides\u00a0more direct evidence for sequential class switching and the existence of dominant class switch pathways. While our lineage reconstruction approach circumvents the difficulties associated with ancestral inference and probabilistic models of class switching, one limitation is that measurements of switch rates can be affected by undersampling of ancestors, especially for switches between rare classes, such as IgE and IgG4. We have estimated this undersampling rate by\u00a0using a Chapman estimator to gauge the total number of each isotype in circulation compared to the number we detected, and found results ranging from 0.1% to 5% depending on the subject, which does not affect any of the conclusions of this work."

In conjunction with other published results, it appears that, with the possible exception of IgE, any transition which is permitted to happen by the geometry of the immunoglobulin locus is observed in healthy human samples. This finding supports the view that the machinery underlying CSR is intrinsically stochastic, and that biological regulation enforces probabilistic preferences, rather than strict rules in switch behavior."

Importantly, identical twins did not exhibit identical class switching landscapes, indicating that class switching is driven largely by non-heritable factors, which likely include exposure to pathogens or other microbes. Previous studies of identical twins have suggested that genetic background controls features of the antibody repertoire, such as IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ gene use, and CDR3 length (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). On the other hand, studies examining other components of the immune system have indicated that non-heritable factors dominantly influence most features of serological and cellular responses, including serum protein abundances and cell populations (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brodin et al., 2015</a>). Our findings suggest that variation between human in the class composition of the antibody repertoire is predominantly driven by the ability of the immune system to adapt to environmental stimuli, rather than genetic predisposition. Unique landscapes of antibody class switching in identical twins likely arise from the unpredictable stimulation of B cell clones and different exposure to many microbes over the course of a lifetime. Our measurement of the conserved\u00a0class switching landscape of healthy, young adult humans provides a reference for comparison against individuals with altered immune states, such as autoimmunity or chronic infection."

We have uncovered strong correlations between the class switch fates of closely related B cells which have undergone maturation in the natural context in living humans. These correlations appear to decay on a timescale of ~10 somatic mutations. Such correlations between closely related cells are also generated during in vitro culture of purified B cell populations in the presence of cytokines that induce class switching, demonstrating that the correlations are an autonomous property of purified B cells and that the in vivo environment is not necessary to create them. Although cytokine signals driving CSR in vivo likely\u00a0originate from cognate T helper cells and dendritic cells in localized intercellular niches, our experiments show that correlations in class switch fate between sibling cells cannot simply be attributed to exposure to common signals due to co-occupancy of the same niche. This mode of regulation contrasts with stem cell maintenance and differentiation in the mammalian lung, which are regulated by signaling from parent/progenitor cells to daughter cells in localized niches (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pardo-Saganta et al., 2015</a>). We note that the correlations that we observed in vitro were not quite as strong as those seen in vivo, suggesting that cellular interactions in the natural context might enhance sibling correlations in class switch fates. We note that in our culture experiments the starting populations were heterogeneous and included\u00a0both na\u00efve and memory B cells, leaving\u00a0the lineage characteristics of class switching within these compartments to be examined in future work."

Consistent with this, directed CSR is thought to be regulated via cytokine-activated transcription at specific IGHC loci, which targets the region for modification by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Germline transcription of IGHC genes is associated with histone modifications that increase DNA accessibility (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jeevan-Raj et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2009</a>), and germline IGHC transcripts can\u00a0form RNA-DNA hybrids with genomic DNA, exposing ssDNA to AID attack (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reaban and Griffin, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Reaban et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yu et al., 2003</a>). Using single-cell transcriptomics, we have found that single B cells stimulated to class switch in vitro often predominantly express germline transcripts from a single IGHC locus (F.\u00a0Horns,\u00a0unpublished data). We propose that inheritance during mitosis of germline transcripts and chromatin state in the IGHC locus, including perhaps\u00a0histone modifications influencing DNA accessibility, is a mechanism that generates correlations in the class switch fates of sister cells. Importantly, epigenetic inheritance of active and repressed chromatin state during mitosis has been demonstrated (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cavalli and Paro, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Grewal and Klar, 1996</a>). Our measurements suggest that the timescale on which the relative accessibility of IGHC loci persists is ~10 somatic mutations. Calibration of the mutational clock should allow recovery of information about epigenetic state and phenotypic dynamics in units of time and cellular generations. Together with recent studies of mammalian (<a href=\"#bib39\">Spencer et al., 2009</a>) and bacterial cells in culture (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hormoz et al., 2015</a>), our work suggests that phenotypic correlations between sister cells due to shared inheritance are widespread. We predict that such correlations often will be detected when genealogical relationships between individual cells can be resolved. We propose that inheritance of epigenetic state provides a mechanism for orchestrating cellular behavior without the need for signaling."

By plotting the identity of each sequence to the most similar sequence in its group (its 'nearest neighbor'), we saw that sequences separate into two groups: sequences with a highly similar nearest neighbor (&gt;90% identity) and sequences that are substantially dissimilar to the nearest neighbor (40\u201380% identity). This pattern suggests that the first group consists of sequences that belong to a clonal lineage, while the second group consists of singleton sequences. Thus using a stringent cutoff of 95% sequence identity in the CDR3 ensures that the identified lineages contain sequences that are clonally related. In order to show that the results are not sensitive to the particular choice of a cutoff value we repeated subsequent analyses with cutoffs varying from 80% to 95% and obtained nearly identical results (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>)."

We sorted CD19+ IgM+ cells and cultured them at 5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml for 5 days at 37 C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.1\u2009mM non-essential amino acid (Sigma-Aldrich,\u00a0St.\u00a0Louis,\u00a0MO), 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate, 100 \u00b5/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (ThermoFisher), 40 \u00b5g/ml apo-transferrin, 500 ng/\u00b5l multimeric CD40 ligand (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA), 200 ng/ml IL-4 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 200 ng/ml IL-10 (Sigma-Aldrich). We extracted RNA from the cells using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions, but omitting the DNase digestion step. We then prepared sequencing libraries using 24.5 ng of total RNA as input as described above, except that PCR products were purified using Ampure XP beads at a 0.65:1 ratio instead of a 1:1 ratio before pooling for multiplexed sequencing. We processed the sequences, reconstructed the clonal lineage histories, and measured correlations between the class switch fates of related cells as described above."

Such correlations could arise due to differential sampling of lineages. In this case, similarities in switching might be due to similar distances of parents to children.

In the example raised, independent somatic mutations are likely to have accumulated along the Z -&gt;X and Z -&gt; Y branches. Therefore, one can exclude most cases where the X -&gt; Y transition is incorrectly inferred due to failure to sample Z by examining only sequences where all somatic mutations present in X are inherited by Y. We repeated our analysis of class switch landscapes using only pairs of sequences which satisfy this condition. We called somatic mutations relative to the germline V and J genes to ensure that the ancestral state is known with high confidence. We found that the patterns of class switching measured using only these sequences were highly similar to those measured using all sequence pairs from the full lineage tree approach (R^2 ranging from 0.96 to 1). This suggests that artifacts arising from imperfect sampling of ancestral sequences have not substantially distorted our measurements. We have added a supplemental figure showing these results (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and noted these results in the main text in the subsection \u201cMeasuring the Landscape of Antibody Class Switching\u201d."

Indeed, an individual\u2019s class switching landscape is not identical with his or her own landscape measured 28 days later. Nevertheless, our data show that class switching patterns of identical twins are no better correlated than pairs of unrelated individuals.

Such correlations could arise due to differential sampling of lineages. In this case, similarities in switching might be due to similar distances of parents to children. In other words: Are the length of branches associated with particular switching events? And if so, are branch length of sisters correlated? This can be readily checked.</i> "

These plots show that the probability distribution of switch fate is strongly biased toward the class to which the sister switches, and the bias dissipates as somatic mutations accumulate. This change in the probability distribution is consistent with the existence of a cell state that favors a particular class switch outcome.
