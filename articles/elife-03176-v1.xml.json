In order to avoid detection by host antibodies, trypanosomes repeatedly switch to new VSG coats (<a href=\"#bib4\">Horn and McCulloch, 2010</a>). Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Markus Engstler and colleagues from the University of W\u00fcrzburg\u2014including Christopher Batram as first author\u2014argue that the process of switching the VSG coat could play a central role in both helping the trypanosome to avoid the mammalian immune system and helping it to escape from the mammal into the insect (<a href=\"#bib1\">Batram et al., 2014</a>)."

The active VSG is expressed in a strictly mutually exclusive fashion from an expression site located at the end of a chromosome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Batram et al. forced the trypanosome to express a different VSG from elsewhere in the genome. Surprisingly, a repressive gradient that extends from the chromosome end resulted in the active VSG expression site shutting down. This silencing was dependent on a histone methyltransferase (<a href=\"#bib2\">Figueiredo et al., 2008</a>), indicating that chromatin remodelling was involved. Amazingly, this expression site silencing also appeared to trigger trypanosomes to change from the proliferative form that undergoes continuous division in the bloodstream to become the non-proliferative form that is adapted for life in the insect."

Using genetic techniques to knock down these genes also triggered the trypanosome to change from the proliferative to the non-proliferative form. It therefore appears that some expression site associated genes could function as \u2018sensors\u2019 that cue trypanosomes to become quiescent when the expression site shuts down. This suggests that VSG expression site silencing\u2014which could potentially be reversed\u2014may be involved in trypanosomes preparing for life in the tsetse fly."

As silencing the active expression site is reversible, the proliferating form of the parasite may be able to adopt a \u2018wait and see\u2019 state before committing to becoming non-proliferative. This challenges the paradigm that commitment to a non-proliferative form depends on the population density of the parasites, and is an irreversible process."

It is not clear if this causative link between expression site silencing and progression through the life cycle also occurs in a natural infection. Alternatively, it could be a byproduct of forcing the trypanosome to express high levels of a second surface coat gene. How often would a trypanosome normally find itself in a situation where high levels of a second VSG are expressed, but not the associated ESAGs?"

However, Batram et al. also propose an unexpected link between VSG coat switching and how the parasite progresses through its life cycle. When trypanosomes reach high densities in the mammalian host, do they follow predetermined genetic programming in the hope that they will be picked up by a tsetse fly? Or alternatively, can trypanosomes reversibly probe various options? The answers will certainly prove informative as to how this seemingly simple single-celled parasite outsmarts its more highly evolved hosts."
