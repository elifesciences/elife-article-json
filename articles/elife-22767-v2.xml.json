This is surprising, as defective gene silencing underlies developmental abnormalities and disease. Here we delineate the sequence and functional contribution of transcriptional repression mechanisms at high temporal resolution. Inducible entry of the NuRD-interacting transcriptional regulator Ikaros into mouse pre-B cell nuclei triggered immediate binding to target gene promoters. Rapid RNAP2 eviction, transcriptional shutdown, nucleosome invasion, and reduced transcriptional activator binding required chromatin remodeling by NuRD-associated Mi2beta/CHD4, but were independent of HDAC activity. Histone deacetylation occurred after transcriptional repression. Nevertheless, HDAC activity contributed to stable gene silencing. Hence, high resolution mapping of transcriptional repression reveals complex and interdependent mechanisms that underpin rapid transitions between transcriptional states, and elucidates the temporal order, functional role and mechanistic separation of NuRD-associated enzymatic activities."

This is surprising, as defective gene silencing underlies developmental abnormalities and disease. Here we delineate the sequence and functional contribution of transcriptional repression mechanisms at high temporal resolution. Inducible entry of the NuRD-interacting transcriptional regulator Ikaros into mouse pre-B cell nuclei triggered immediate binding to target gene promoters. Rapid RNAP2 eviction, transcriptional shutdown, nucleosome invasion, and reduced transcriptional activator binding required chromatin remodeling by NuRD-associated Mi2beta/CHD4, but were independent of HDAC activity. Histone deacetylation occurred after transcriptional repression. Nevertheless, HDAC activity contributed to stable gene silencing. Hence, high resolution mapping of transcriptional repression reveals complex and interdependent mechanisms that underpin rapid transitions between transcriptional states, and elucidates the temporal order, functional role and mechanistic separation of NuRD-associated enzymatic activities."

The dynamics of inducible gene expression have been characterised in exquisite detail (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ballar\u00e9 et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cosma, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gr\u00f8ntved et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Vicent et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Voss and Hager, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hargreaves et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Smale and Natoli, 2014</a>). Compared to gene activation, the mechanisms that underpin gene repression have received less attention (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brockdorff and Turner, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cosma, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Feng et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fuda et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Grossniklaus and Paro, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Su et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Trinh et al., 2001</a>). Understanding transcriptional repression is important because defects in gene silencing result in developmental abnormalities and disease (<a href=\"#bib16\">Denslow and Wade, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Watson et al., 2012</a>). The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) corepressor complex is critical for developmental gene regulation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Costa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Laugesen and Helin, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Reynolds et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yamada et al., 2014</a>). NuRD malfunction leads to birth defects (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fahrner and Bjornsson, 2014</a>) and underlies disease states ranging from autism spectrum disorders (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yamada et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yang et al., 2016</a>) to cancer (<a href=\"#bib39\">Laugesen and Helin, 2014</a>). NuRD is unique among corepressors in that it brings together histone deacetylation and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities in the same complex, and therefore may have the necessary enzymatic attributes to convert active promoters into densely packed, hypoacetylated chromatin refractory to the transcriptional machinery. It has been argued that understanding the kinetics of changes in nucleosome positioning and modifications that accompany transcriptional repression is important to link the biochemical properties of NuRD with our understanding of chromatin-based gene regulation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Denslow and Wade, 2007</a>). Meeting this challenge is difficult in experimental systems where the kinetics are slow (<a href=\"#bib13\">Costa et al., 2012</a>), or gene silencing is asynchronous (<a href=\"#bib54\">Reynolds et al., 2012</a>)."

Nuclear translocation results in immediate binding to target gene promoters, providing a clear path to target gene regulation. Using this approach we demonstrate that transcriptional repression is surprisingly rapid: promoters are depleted of RNAP2 and invaded by nucleosomes within minutes. Mechanistically, RNAP2 eviction is controlled by chromatin accessibility, not <i>vice versa</i>. Kinetic analysis reveals an unexpected temporal dissociation between NuRD enzymatic activities: CHD4-dependent remodeling - but not HDAC activity - initiates repression by excluding transcriptional activators and RNAP2. However, stable silencing and pericentromeric repositioning of Ikaros target genes require both nucleosome remodeling and HDAC activity. Hence, our high resolution view reveals that transcriptional repression involves complex and interdependent mechanisms, and that the enzymatic activities of CHD4 and HDACs are selectively required at different times and for discrete aspects of gene silencing."

RNAP2 occupancy decreased at promoters, gene bodies, and the 3' end of transcription units (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), suggesting that Ikaros represses <i>Igll1</i> and <i>Myc</i> transcription by interfering with RNAP2 recruitment rather than elongation. Genome-wide, RNAP2 occupancy was significantly reduced at 372 downregulated genes 6 hr after Ikaros translocation (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The great majority of repressed genes with reduced RNAP2 occupancy showed a global reduction in RNAP2 binding to both the promoter and the gene body (324 of 372 or 87%). Only a small minority of repressed genes showed a block in RNAP2 elongation, as judged by preferential reduction of RNAP2 occupancy over the gene body (15 of 372 or 4% of genes with reduced RNAP2 occupancy). Hence, transcriptional repression of Ikaros target genes occurred by reduced RNAP2 recruitment, and a block in RNAP2 elongation was the exception."

Given the critical role for NuRD-associated chromatin remodeling activity in Ikaros-mediated gene silencing we asked whether HDAC activity was equally involved. Unexpectedly, broad inhibition of HDAC activity by trichostatin A (TSA) did not detectably interfere with Ikaros-induced loss of RNAP2, reduced promoter accessibility and early transcriptional repression of <i>Igll1</i> and <i>Myc</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Similarly, HDAC inhibition did not interfere with the transcriptional downregulation of Ikaros target genes in primary pre-B cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). To address the possibility that the ERt2 component of the Ikaros-ERt2 fusion protein might account for the apparent lack of HDAC activity in Ikaros-initiated gene silencing we performed experiments where the nuclear translocation of Ikaros was triggered by the inducible cleavage of Ikaros-TEV-ERt2 fusion proteins. TEV-induced nuclear translocation of Ikaros in the absence or ERt2 confirmed that HDAC activity was not required for the loss of accessibility (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, left) or the transcriptional silencing of <i>Igll1</i> and <i>Myc</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, right)."

Prolonged HDAC inhibition significantly blunted this increase in the H2B/H3 ratio (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), indicating that HDAC activity facilitated the assembly of H2B-containing nucleosomes."

Strikingly, the decrease in EBF1 binding seen in control cells was significantly blunted in the absence of CHD4. In this regard, the binding kinetics of Ikaros and EBF1 in the absence of CHD4 resembled a 3-state model (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) where an incremental increase in nuclear Ikaros concentration triggers a steep rise in Ikaros binding during the second time interval and results in little or no eviction of EBF1. In control cells, the observed dynamics more closely resembled a 4-state model (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) where Ikaros and EBF1 compete for binding sites that remain accessible. Consistent with a scenario where Ikaros not only displaces EBF1, but ultimately limits its own binding, integration of MNase-seq with Ikaros ChIP-seq showed that nuclear translocation of Ikaros increases nucleosome occupancy at Ikaros ChIP-seq peaks genome-wide (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

BRG1 did not return to the remodeled <i>Igll1</i> promoter even after the binding of CHD4 and MBD3 declined, which may in part explain why promoter accessibility was not re-instated, suggesting that Ikaros-mediated NuRD recruitment and eviction of BRG1 may cooperate in the repression of Ikaros target genes."

At the Ikaros target genes <i>Igll1</i> and <i>Myc</i> as well as genome-wide, RNAP2 recruitment, rather than RNAP2 elongation, was the primary mechanism by which Ikaros repressed RNAP2-dependent transcription.

Experimental depletion of RNAP2 and the resulting loss of RNAP2-mediated transcription did not interfere with Ikaros-induced promoter remodelling. This is consistent with a direct role for Ikaros in target gene repression, and reminiscent of primary response gene induction in the absence of protein synthesis.

This restricts promoter access, excludes RNAP2 and the transcriptional activator EBF1, and ultimately limits binding of Ikaros itself.

We used an EBF1 antibody (Santa Cruz sc-137065) previously characterised by ENCODE for EBF1 ChIP-seq. For RNAP2, chromatin remodeler and histone modification ChIP (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brookes et al., 2012</a>) cells were fixed as described for MNase, lysed in 25 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.1% NP-40, pH 7.9 at 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> cells/ml on ice for 15 min, centrifuged at 900 rcf for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, resuspended in 140 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.9 and sonicated for 25 min at 4\u00b0C with 30 s on, and 30 s off (Bioruptor, Diagenode). Sonicated chromatin was recovered as supernatant after centrifugation at 25,000\u00a0rcf for 15 min at 4\u00b0C and incubated with antibodies to histone H3 (Abcam AB1791), acetylated histone H3 (Abcam AB47915), acetylated histone H4 (Millipore 06\u2013866), RNAP2 (Santa Cruz sc-899), TFIIB (Santa Cruz sc-225), CHD4 (Abcam AB70469), MBD3 (Bethyl A302-528A) or Brg1 (Millipore, 07\u2013478) on a rotating platform at 4\u00b0C overnight, washed sequentially in 140 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.9 followed by 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.9 followed by 250 mM LiCl, 50 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 8.0 and finally 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. Reverse crosslinked DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. For ChIP-seq, 10 ng ChIP and input DNA were used to prepare libraries (Next Ultra, NEB) with size selection for fragments between 100 and 300 bp. After 50 bp single-end sequencing (Hi-seq 2500, Illumina,\u00a0~155 M reads per condition), reads were aligned to mm9 using BWA version 0.7.5. SAM files were generated, aligned, sorted and indexed with samtools version 0.1.18. Duplicate reads were marked using Picard MarkDuplicates. The quality of the datasets and predicted fragment lengths were analysed using the ChIPQC Bioconductor package. Normalised BigWig files were generated using rtracklayer (version 1.3.2) with signal normalised to total mapped fragments per sample. ChIP-seq sample quality was assessed using ChIPQC (version 1.8.7) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carroll et al., 2014</a>). For the analysis of differential polymerase signal in genes and TSS regions, gene models for mm9 were retrieved from Ensembl Biomart. Total reads were counted within TSSs and gene bodies and analysis of differential binding performed using DEseq2 with efficiency and library complexity derived from ChIPQC supplied to the DEseq2 model as normalisation factors (<a href=\"#bib41\">Love et al., 2014</a>). MNase signal over Ikaros ChIP-seq peaks (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ferreir\u00f3s-Vidal et al., 2013</a>) was calculated using the Bioconductor soGGi package (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dharmalingam and Carroll, 2015</a>) and differential MNase signal identified using the DChIPrep package (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chabbert et al., 2016</a>). Differential gene expression was based on a p-value of\u00a0&lt;0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing (adj. p&lt;0.05)."

A major point raised in the review process was whether the ChIP data shown represents biologically independent measurements or technical replicates from single preparations of chromatin. A number of experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>) show detailed measurements about protein occupancy or histone modification, but in some cases, the authors do not provide enough information about the data presented to allow the reader to judge if the changes measured are convincing demonstrations of biological processes. Specifically, for most of the ChIP measurements, the figure legend notes n=3; is that three measurements of single chromatin preparation, or three independent preparations, independently measured? Certain experiments (e.g. 4D) are described as \"independent experiments\", thus, the former cases may represent a single biological experiment (chromatin prep), with independent chromatin IP measurements. One line of evidence supporting this view is that individual figures have fairly tight error bars, yet vary quite a bit between experiments, e.g. RNAP drop in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a> is 3-5 fold, while in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> the change is ~2 fold. The paper should clearly distinguish technical from biological replicates, and indicate if the results are supported by more than one experiment. Clearly, the strength of the conclusions is related to the reproducibility of the effects from separate observations."

A second point from the review was need to set the authors' findings in a more general context, to show how information about HDAC, NuRD, and chromatin structure in regulation of Myc and Ipll1 supports or contradicts previous studies on Ikaros action. For instance, earlier work from Georgopoulos showed that on the CD4 intronic enhancer, Ikaros and NuRD appear to antagonize each other's activity, such that loss of CHD4 results in enhanced, not reduced Ikaros, activity. Similarly, previous studies have implicated basal factor pTefb-Ikaros interactions, as well as polycomb. Other studies have shown concomitant binding of Ikaros and Ebf1 at the Igll1 promoter in large pre-B cells where the gene is expressed, raising the question of whether Ikaros activates in this context. The paper would be much more valuable to the community if the authors integrate their findings better with previous work, and in the Discussion propose how similarities or differences are to be reconciled. As it stands, the main summary concluding the paper is rather superficial."

The reviewers found that the integration of genome-wide information was potentially useful but incomplete; the quality of genome-wide information should be indicated with standard statistical measures (e.g. how much agreement is found among the triplicate MNase experiments? reproducibility of peaks etc.), even if the analysis of the entire dataset is being prepared in a separate study. MNase digestion patterns at two loci discussed, but overall significance is difficult to assess; is variation indicative of a change in nucleosome position, occupancy or other aspect of the individual experiments? It is not clear if the RNA pol II genome-wide study was similarly performed in triplicate. A related point to consideration of genome-wide data is related to point 2; it is reported that out of the 924 genes repressed upon increase in Ikaros expression, 372 show a reduction in RNAP2. How are the other 550 genes regulated? Are these not directly repressed by the Ikaros-NuRD complex? It would help this paper to provide enough information to understand <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and Supplementary Data <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, which enumerate and list genes affected by Ikaros. For instance, the two genes studied in detail here are direct targets of Ikaros, and show a loss of RNA Pol II. A large number, but not the majority of other repressed genes also show a loss of Pol II; which of these are expected to be direct targets? An additional point regarding the table is the lack of clarity of how genes are assigned to it \u2013 is for example a log2 value of 0.05 even a significant change?"

The reviewers had differing opinions about the modeling; some asked for further validation through additional measurements of actual nucleosome positioning and Ikaros occupancy at individual sites, while another view was that the models are useful enough to point toward future studies of mechanism. A justification of the application of the modeling would strengthen this aspect of the study. In addition, a clarification of the actual mechanism suggested is requested: Ikaros has been variously described as a recruiter of NuRD, or an antagonist, or binding in an overlapping manner at promoters but not enhancers. The kinetics of binding shown in 4D indicate that a model with simple, stable recruitment of NuRD by Ikaros is too simple. But it is not clear what mechanism the authors are proposing, based on their findings."

A western blot analysis for Ikaros in the nuclear vs, cytoplasmic fractions at the different time points should be performed. The way the ChIP data is presented, it is not clear how much endogenous Ikaros is already present at the target promoters before the induction of the tamoxifen-regulated protein, and how this compares with the induced levels. Previous studies have already noted that Ikaros is present at these genes, so how much of the modifications are due to overexpression of the protein? Why would nucleosome changes results only from overexpression; is this a function of rapid interconversion between active and inactive states on the genes with only endogenous Ikaros? In addition, the paper is silent about the Ikaros-like Aiolos protein; is it present at these genes, and does it play a role in regulation under these conditions?"

To identify such changes as an alternatively-bound form of the nucleosome, one would wish for a titration of MNase, not just a single digestion. In addition, it would be important to know if the change is due to a nucleosome shifting in position, rather than being weakly bound. Finally, the differential amplification in 6B with \"short\" and \"long\" amplicons may or may not be significant \u2013 it is not clear if the n=3 is a technical replicate, in which case, the support is weak."

A major point raised in the review process was whether the ChIP data shown represents biologically independent measurements or technical replicates from single preparations of chromatin. A number of experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>) show detailed measurements about protein occupancy or histone modification, but in some cases, the authors do not provide enough information about the data presented to allow the reader to judge if the changes measured are convincing demonstrations of biological processes. Specifically, for most of the ChIP measurements, the figure legend notes n=3; is that three measurements of single chromatin preparation, or three independent preparations, independently measured? Certain experiments (e.g. 4D) are described as \"independent experiments\", thus, the former cases may represent a single biological experiment (chromatin prep), with independent chromatin IP measurements. One line of evidence supporting this view is that individual figures have fairly tight error bars, yet vary quite a bit between experiments, e.g. RNAP drop in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a> is 3-5 fold, while in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> the change is ~2 fold. The paper should clearly distinguish technical from biological replicates, and indicate if the results are supported by more than one experiment. Clearly, the strength of the conclusions is related to the reproducibility of the effects from separate observations.</i>"

A second point from the review was need to set the authors' findings in a more general context, to show how information about HDAC, NuRD, and chromatin structure in regulation of Myc and Ipll1 supports or contradicts previous studies on Ikaros action. For instance, earlier work from Georgopoulos showed that on the CD4 intronic enhancer, Ikaros and NuRD appear to antagonize each other's activity, such that loss of CHD4 results in enhanced, not reduced Ikaros, activity. Similarly, previous studies have implicated basal factor pTefb-Ikaros interactions, as well as polycomb. Other studies have shown concomitant binding of Ikaros and Ebf1 at the Igll1 promoter in large pre-B cells where the gene is expressed, raising the question of whether Ikaros activates in this context. The paper would be much more valuable to the community if the authors integrate their findings better with previous work, and in the Discussion propose how similarities or differences are to be reconciled. As it stands, the main summary concluding the paper is rather superficial.</i>"

However, it is worth noting that previous reports occasionally contradict each other. For example, there is marked disagreement between the Georgopoulos (Zhang et al. Nat Immunol. 2011, 13: 86-94) and Busslinger labs (Schwickert et al., 2014). We did not examine CHD4 positioning in Ikzf1-deficient cells, nor did we investigate the role of IKAROS, HDACs, or CHD4 at the proximal Cd4 enhancer (Williams et al., Immunity. 2004, 20: 719-33), which is active in T-cells but not in B-cells. Instead, we focus on Igll1 and Myc, which are repressed by IKAROS with fast kinetics, and by a mechanism that primarily depends on CHD4, and secondarily on HDAC activity. Importantly, not all IKAROS target genes are repressed by IKAROS. Our manuscript illustrates this by showing increasing chromatin accessibility, RNAP2 occupancy and transcriptional output for the IKAROS target gene Zfp36 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B, C</a>, and D). We have placed more emphasis on this in the revised manuscript by including the sentence \u201cthe molecular determinants of whether IKAROS binding results in gene activation or repression remain to be explored\u201d. We also point out that reduced RNAP2 occupancy, reduced accessibility and transcriptional repression \u201cwere selective for Ikaros-repressed genes, as illustrated by comparison with the Ikaros-induced gene Zfp36 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C-D</a>)\u201d."

We have not explored the biochemical interaction between IKAROS and P-TEVb directly. Among IKAROS-repressed genes, few are regulated at the level of RNAP2 elongation (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). However, in line with your comment and with the findings of Bottardi et al., we saw a significant increase in RNAP2 occupancy at 215 genes that were upregulated by IKAROS (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Of these, 202 showed an increase of RNAP2 at both the TSS and the gene body, indicating that increased recruitment of RNAP2 to the TSS was accompanied by a corresponding increase in elongation events. Only 13 upregulated genes with increased RNAP2 binding showed an accumulation of RNAP2 at the TSS (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). These data are consistent with a role for IKAROS in promoting transcriptional elongation at upregulated genes that show increased RNAP2 occupancy."

This fact is indicated by the following sentence in our manuscript: \u201cWe saw no detectable increase in the trimethylation of H3K27 by PRC2 (Oravecz et al., 2015) at the Igll1 and Myc promoters 24h after nuclear translocation of Ikaros\u201d."

As pointed out by the referees, binding of Ikaros to the Igll1 promoter in large pre-B cells could potentially indicate a positive effect of IKAROS on Igll1 in large pre-B cells. To test this idea, we expressed a dominant negative form of Ikaros (IKAROS 159A). If IKAROS activates Igll1 in large pre-B cells, IKAROS 159A would be predicted to reduce Igll1 expression in large pre-B cells. Conversely, if IKAROS represses Igll1 in large pre-B cells, IKAROS 159A would be predicted to increase Igll1 expression. IKAROS 159A increased the expression of Igll1 (Thompson et al., 2007), demonstrating that Ikaros does not activate Igll1 in large pre-B cells."

MNase digestion patterns at two loci discussed, but overall significance is difficult to assess; is variation indicative of a change in nucleosome position, occupancy or other aspect of the individual experiments? It is not clear if the RNA pol II genome-wide study was similarly performed in triplicate. A related point to consideration of genome-wide data is related to point 2; it is reported that out of the 924 genes repressed upon increase in Ikaros expression, 372 show a reduction in RNAP2. How are the other 550 genes regulated? Are these not directly repressed by the Ikaros-NuRD complex?

To test whether this is due to a difference in sensitivity between RNA-seq and RNAP2 ChIP-seq, we repeated our analysis considering only genes that were significantly downregulated and also showed a minimal log2 fold- change of 2. Of 174 genes that met these criteria, 95 showed a significant reduction in RNAP2 ChIP- seq signal (55%). The percentage of downregulated genes with significantly reduced RNAP2 ChIP- seq signal further increased to 62% when considering only genes downregulated with adj. p&lt;0.01. The finding that the majority of strongly downregulated genes had reduced RNAP2 ChIP-seq signals supports the idea that downregulated expression without reduced RNAP2 ChIP-seq signals is due at least in part to a difference in sensitivity between RNA-seq and RNAP2 ChIP-seq. Regardless of the criteria applied to define downregulated genes, reduced RNAP2 elongation remained an exception among IKAROS/NuRD-repressed genes: 4% (15/372) at adj. p&lt;0.05, 5.4% (5/93) at log2FC&gt;2 and p&lt;0.05, and 4.6% (4/87) at log2FC&gt;2 and p&lt;0.01."

The reviewers had differing opinions about the modeling; some asked for further validation through additional measurements of actual nucleosome positioning and Ikaros occupancy at individual sites, while another view was that the models are useful enough to point toward future studies of mechanism. A justification of the application of the modeling would strengthen this aspect of the study. In addition, a clarification of the actual mechanism suggested is requested: Ikaros has been variously described as a recruiter of NuRD, or an antagonist, or binding in an overlapping manner at promoters but not enhancers. The kinetics of binding shown in 4D indicate that a model with simple, stable recruitment of NuRD by Ikaros is too simple.

The Ikaros family member Ikzf3 is upregulated between the large (Fr.C') and small (Fr.D) pre-B cell stage (Thompson et al., 2007), and increased Ikaros/Aiolos expression drives increased binding to target gene promoters (Thompson et al., 2007; Ferreiros-Vidal et al., 2013).

This is consistent with proposals that acetylation/deacetylation cycles may promote transcription (Wang et al., Cell 2009, 138: 1019-1031; Perissi et al., Nat Rev Genet 2010, 11: 109\u2013123). Importantly, TSA increased global H3 and H4 acetylation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, left) and ChIP experiments in the same panel show that TSA prevents Ikaros-induced local deacetylation of H3 and H4 at the Igll1 and Myc promoters. In the cells used for these ChIP experiments, TSA did not interfere with the Ikaros-induced increase in nucleosome occupancy, reduction in RNAP2 occupancy, and transcriptional repression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), supporting our conclusion that HDAC activity is not required for the Ikaros-induced increase in nucleosome occupancy, reduction in RNAP2 occupancy, and transcriptional repression."
