For comparison, a daily round-trip commute of 25 kilometers in a fuel-efficient car produces 1.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.

These carbon footprints reflect the total economic activity of a given country, so the carbon dioxide emissions that are under the control of an individual citizen are substantially smaller. Moreover, the per capita carbon footprint is expected to rise substantially in many countries in the developing world over the next 50 years, driven by a broad increase in the standard of living, so citizens in the developed world need to do all they can to start reducing carbon dioxide emissions now."

If we ignore the energy consumed in the heating and cooling of laboratory buildings \u2013 values that vary widely depending on locale \u2013 we find that most of the carbon footprint is due to refrigerators, freezers and other large items of equipment. For example, it takes ~18 kW-hours per day to operate a freezer at -80\u00b0C, which translates into 4 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year (based on the US average of 1.34 pounds of carbon dioxide per kW-hour; <a href=\"#bib3\">Union of Concerned Scientists, 2012</a>). When lighting, cold rooms and smaller items of laboratory equipment (such as computers, spectrophotometers and incubators) are included, we estimate that the equipment in a typical life sciences laboratory of 7\u201310 people would likely generate more than 20 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year."

To partially compensate, we envision a series of smaller local meetings in alternate years that would bring together hundreds or thousands, rather than tens of thousands, of participants. The proposed change would roughly halve the carbon footprints associated with the largest meetings. We have formally proposed this idea to Dr. Hollis Cline, President of the Society for Neuroscience, and she has agreed to put it before the Society\u2019s council. As a practical matter, any proposed changes in the scheduling of large national or international meetings would likely occur on a time scale of at least 5\u201310 years because societies have to book convention centers many years in advance. This is all the more reason to start the process sooner rather than later."

For each of these activities, we should ask whether there is an equivalent seminar speaker or committee member who could travel 300 km instead of 3,000 km. For activities that do not require a face-to-face meeting, such as grant reviews, we should ask whether remote video-conferencing or a conference call could accomplish the same or nearly the same end. Scientists who do not live and work close to major scientific hubs may fear that a reduction in long-distance travel will lead to scientific isolation. Solutions to this challenge might include traveling with an itinerary that includes multiple clustered destinations and making greater use of electronic communication technology."

However, the cost-benefit balance has shifted: climate-change costs are long-term and they are going to be staggeringly disruptive. This new reality calls for greater flexibility and greater creativity in how we conduct our business. Fortunately, we are more connected now than ever before, thanks to today\u2019s technology, so we can offset a reduction in face-to-face meetings by making greater use of electronic communication. For example, when one of us (JN) was invited to lecture in Hyderabad, India, the lecture, together with a question-and-answer session, was delivered in real-time via a remote video-link from a studio at Johns Hopkins University in the US. With video screens simultaneously showing the speaker, the audience and the PowerPoint presentation, the experience was remarkably similar to a live presentation. The entire event took the speaker less time than he would have spent driving to the airport and waiting to board the plane to India. It also vacated an airplane seat that would have generated 2.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide."

Moreover, a demonstration by the scientific community that it is taking concrete action would be an important step in convincing the general public to consider similar actions. Conversely, if scientists \u2013 arguably the most highly educated, informed and intellectually rigorous members of society \u2013 do not lead by example, then who else will lead?"
