                    "text": "Metabolite exchange among co-growing cells is frequent by nature, however, is not necessarily occurring at growth-relevant quantities indicative of non-cell-autonomous metabolic function. Complementary auxotrophs of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> amino acid and nucleotide metabolism regularly fail to compensate for each other's deficiencies upon co-culturing, a situation which implied the absence of growth-relevant metabolite exchange interactions. Contrastingly, we find that yeast colonies maintain a rich exometabolome and that cells prefer the uptake of extracellular metabolites over self-synthesis, indicators of ongoing metabolite exchange. We conceived a system that circumvents co-culturing and begins with a self-supporting cell that grows autonomously into a heterogeneous community, only able to survive by exchanging histidine, leucine, uracil, and methionine. Compensating for the progressive loss of prototrophy, self-establishing communities successfully obtained an auxotrophic composition in a nutrition-dependent manner, maintaining a wild-type like exometabolome, growth parameters, and cell viability. Yeast, as a eukaryotic model, thus possesses extensive capacity for growth-relevant metabolite exchange and readily cooperates in metabolism within progressively establishing communities."

Complementary auxotrophs of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> amino acid and nucleotide metabolism regularly fail to compensate for each other's deficiencies upon co-culturing, a situation which implied the absence of growth-relevant metabolite exchange interactions. Contrastingly, we find that yeast colonies maintain a rich exometabolome and that cells prefer the uptake of extracellular metabolites over self-synthesis, indicators of ongoing metabolite exchange. We conceived a system that circumvents co-culturing and begins with a self-supporting cell that grows autonomously into a heterogeneous community, only able to survive by exchanging histidine, leucine, uracil, and methionine. Compensating for the progressive loss of prototrophy, self-establishing communities successfully obtained an auxotrophic composition in a nutrition-dependent manner, maintaining a wild-type like exometabolome, growth parameters, and cell viability. Yeast, as a eukaryotic model, thus possesses extensive capacity for growth-relevant metabolite exchange and readily cooperates in metabolism within progressively establishing communities."

However, in the laboratory, complementary metabolically deficient yeast cells do not survive when mixed together. It was presumed this is because yeast cells make only enough of each essential metabolite for themself, and so can\u2019t replace those that are missing from their neighbouring cells. Campbell et al. now challenge this view by finding that yeast cells release a variety of metabolites, they use these released metabolites in preference to making their own, and possess the capacity to grow on the basis of a non-cell-autonomous metabolism."

This method uses yeast cells that have one or more of their own metabolic genes disabled, and instead have a copy of these genes on small circular DNA 'mini-chromosomes' (called plasmids). The gene on the plasmid can compensate for the yeast having its own gene missing, and allows the cell to still make the metabolic product it needs to survive. However, as a single cell divides to form a colony, cells randomly lose these plasmids, leaving some of the cells deficient for a particular metabolite. These cells can only survive if the other cells in the colony export the missing metabolite in the quantity needed for growth. Using this test, Campbell et al. found that yeast cells can export missing metabolites at levels needed to sustain these emerging metabolic mutants. Additionally, these yeast communities could grow at levels comparable to other yeast without metabolic deficiencies. The resulting colonies also feature one of several different genetic and metabolic profiles, which change in response to the metabolite that is missing."

The additional discovery that yeast stop making metabolites when they can obtain them from neighbouring cells has implications for research. This is because many yeast genetic studies use metabolically deficient strains that are supplemented in culture with metabolites. Future work could address whether such supplementation has kept certain functions of metabolism hidden."

The reactions participating in this network are highly conserved, so much so that all life is made up of a markedly similar set of metabolites (<a href=\"#bib5\">Braakman and Smith, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Caetano-Anolles et al., 2009</a>). The functionality of the metabolic system is bound to a series of transport reactions that facilitate the uptake of metabolites from the environment, as well as metabolite export. Metabolite export primarily occurs for the purpose of maintaining balance of the metabolic system ('overflow metabolism') and to maintain chemical and physical integrity of the metabolic network. This includes indiscriminate metabolite export through non-specific multi-drug transporters required in removal of toxic metabolites for cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Paczia et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Piedrafita et al., 2015</a>). Co-growing cells can uptake the released metabolites and exploit their presence. Indeed, to a lower extent, metabolite export of metabolites can specifically occur for the purpose of establishing inter-cellular metabolic interactions in biosynthetic metabolism (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nigam, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Paczia et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yazaki, 2005</a>)\u00a0and can lead to mutualistic situations in which cells profit from coexistence (<a href=\"#bib15\">Foster and Bell, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Oliveira et al., 2014</a>). In between species, mutually positive interactions can readily establish when exchange concerns an overflow metabolite, exemplified by yeast\u2013algae interactions that can form on the basis of a CO<sub>2</sub> and sugar exchange (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hom and Murray, 2014</a>), or between different cells of the same species or tissue, exemplified in tumours, when lactate produced in excess by one cell type is metabolised by another (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bonuccelli et al., 2010</a>), or between neurons and glial cells that exchange sugar metabolites (<a href=\"#bib7\">B\u00e9langer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Volkenhoff et al., 2015</a>)."

Exchange of costly intermediates is associated with a significant risk, as exported metabolites can be lost through diffusion, chemical damage, or cheating (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dobay et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Oliveira et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wintermute and Silver, 2010</a>). Despite these constraints, exchange of intermediates is frequently observed within bacterial microbial communities. Many bacterial species lose essential biosynthetic pathways, disabling them from living autonomously, which may explain why more than 90% of bacteria cannot be cultivated in the absence of a community environment (<a href=\"#bib12\">Costerton et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Johnson et al., 2012</a>). The energetic benefit and selective advantage associated with non-autonomous cellular metabolism is often not clear but might involve, for example, the ability to reduce genome size which would in turn facilitate faster proliferation. This may explain why bacteria frequently appear to cooperate in the biosynthesis of more costly and biosynthetically complex metabolites, such as aromatics (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mee et al., 2014</a>)."

This includes yeast, a popular single cellular eukaryotic model organism, whose metabolic capacities are regularly exploited in biotechnology. Yeast cells are known to participate in multi-species communities (e.g. on human skin (<a href=\"#bib14\">Findley et al., 2013</a>)), but as wild yeast isolates usually maintain similar prototrophic genomes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jeffares et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Liti et al., 2009</a>), metagenomic data are not conclusive about yeast's metabolite exchange strategies. In laboratory experiments, yeast cultures were, however, not effective in supporting co-growth of auxotrophs that have complementary defects in amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, unless they were genetically modified to increase metabolite export (<a href=\"#bib29\">M\u00fcller et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shou et al., 2007</a>). This contrasts with analogous studies in bacterial species, in which such growth experiments regularly show that co-cultured cells can overcome complementary metabolic deficiencies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Foster and Bell, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Oliveira et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Pande et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Vetsigian et al., 2011</a>).

To test whether yeast indeed possesses the capacity for metabolite exchange at growth relevant quantities, we established an alternative method to co-culture experiments. We exploited the stochastic segregation of episomes to randomly and progressively introduce metabolic auxotrophies into a yeast population which self-establishes from an initially prototrophic cell. This strategy enabled co-growing auxotrophs to enter an efficient state of metabolic cooperation, named self-establishing metabolically cooperating communities (SeMeCos). Despite an auxotrophic cell composition of up to 97%, SeMeCos achieve metabolic efficiency, growth parameters, and cell viability similar to that of genetically prototrophic cells, revealing a natural capacity of yeast to exchange metabolites at growth relevant quantities. In a SeMeCo that possesses auxotrophies in histidine, leucine, uracil and methionine metabolism, we distinguish up to eight cell types, each of which is unable to survive on its own, or in co-culture studies, however, could adapt effectively and cooperatively to overcoming metabolic deficiencies, once self-established in a community structure. Communities have a stable population composition as well as distinct spatial heterogeneity, which was, however, not essential for metabolite exchange, as SeMeCos maintain growth in liquid suspension. Self-establishing, complex communities thus demonstrate that yeast is not only exchanging metabolites, but is also able to do so at growth relevant quantities, to facilitate growth on the basis of a non-cell-autonomous metabolism."

                                "text": "A second requirement to establish metabolite exchange is that cells need to be able to sense extracellular metabolites and to exploit them as a nutrient source. Yeast is known to uptake amino acids when they are available extracellularly (<a href=\"#bib44\">Stahl and James, 2014</a>). We tested how extensive this uptake was by comparing the uptake rates between auxotrophs and prototrophs. Remarkably, prototrophic cells consumed histidine, leucine, methionine, and uracil at a comparable rate to the genetic auxotrophs, who depend 100% on external metabolite pools (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This demonstrated that yeast cells completely shift from <i>de novo</i> synthesis to uptake in the presence of each of the four metabolites. Studying the <i>URA3</i> genotype in greater detail confirmed the preference of uptake over self-synthesis. Enzymes involved in uracil biosynthesis remained expressed in both the <i>URA3</i> and the <i>ura3\u0394</i> strains under fully supplemented conditions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), but uracil biosynthesis-related intermediates shifted to similar concentrations both in the wild-type strain and in the <i>ura3\u0394</i> strain once uracil was supplemented (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The only exception was the direct substrate of the <i>URA3</i> enzyme (orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase), orotidine-5'-phosphate (OMP), which accumulated upon uracil supplementation once its metabolising enzyme (<i>URA3)</i> was deleted (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Fi</a>). In summary, yeast cells do not compensate for metabolic deficiencies in co-culture experiments consistently as others reported previously (<a href=\"#bib29\">M\u00fcller et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shou et al., 2007</a>), but they (i) export the relevant metabolites even when grown on minimal media and (ii) take up histidine, leucine, uracil, and methionine at similar rates to auxotrophs if supplementation is available. At least for uracil, (iii) the biosynthetic enzymes and majority of biosynthetic intermediates in the supplemented wild-type cell resemble those of the corresponding auxotroph."

To establish an alternative method, we made use of a, in other circumstances disadvantageous, property of yeast plasmids, their occasional, stochastic loss from cells (segregation). Segregation is observed for both popular replication types, centromeric 'cen' and 2\u00b5, at a rate of 2\u20134% expressed per cell division (<a href=\"#bib11\">Christianson et al., 1992</a>). This property allowed us to randomly and progressively introduce auxotrophies into a developing yeast community starting from a single, initially prototrophic, cell: when a plasmid carries a gene that complements for an auxotrophy, a newly budded cell re-gains the metabolic deficiency according to the segregation of its plasmid. We transformed plasmids from the classic pRS and p400 series which express <i>HIS3, LEU2, MET15</i>, or <i>URA3</i> genes under the respective <i>S. cerevisiae</i> promoters (<a href=\"#bib11\">Christianson et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mumberg et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sikorski and Hieter, 1989</a>) into the standard laboratory strain BY4741, deficient in these markers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Brachmann et al., 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Ai</a>). As expected, the transformed cells grew competently in the absence of histidine, leucine, uracil, and methionine supplementations. We then quantified plasmid segregation and confirmed earlier literature values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Aii</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Christianson et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ghosh et al., 2007</a>)."

Transferred to minimal media, the lack of nutrient supplementation leads to three possible outcomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>): First, if the cooperative potential would not suffice to overcome the increasing content of metabolically deficient cells, colony growth would only be explained by cells maintaining all four plasmids (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> <i>left</i>). Alternatively, if the segregation is faster than the growth rate of cells carrying four plasmids, the colonies would not be able to grow (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> <i>centre</i>). Finally, the third outcome is that colony growth continues, despite an increasing auxotrophic composition, facilitated by cells exchanging histidine, leucine, uracil, and methionine at growth relevant quantities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> <i>right</i>). First, we observed that upon approximately 33 biomass doublings, segregation for <i>HIS3</i> and <i>URA3</i> had continued until less than 50% of cells were prototrophs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), even\u00a0though a 1:1 co-culture of the same auxotrophs was not able to co-grow (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Then, we assayed for the formation of a heterogeneous yeast community, starting from the four-plasmid (4P) strain, that can give rise to the emergence of 16 complementary auxotrophic genotypes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In the 4P strain, individual plasmid segregation rates were similar but not identical to yeast carrying one plasmid at a time and were in linear correlation, indicating that no specific interaction between the plasmids occurred (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Aii</a>). With a total segregation rate of 11%, 4P cells regain auxotrophy rapidly so that only 21 cell divisions (doublings) would result in &gt;90% of cells losing prototrophy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The continuous loss of prototrophy from the 4P strain was experimentally confirmed on rich (YPD) media; In the presence of rich supplementation, only 45 biomass doublings resulted in 96% of cells losing prototrophy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>)."

The experiment yielded viable colonies and from the obtained biomass, we calculated that 57 doublings had occurred. Fifty-seven doublings would have been sufficient for &gt;99% of cells to segregate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

Even when isolated from a functional cooperating colony, complementary auxotrophic cells did not complement each other's deficiencies upon co-culturing (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), ruling out the possibility that new mutations altering metabolite exchange capacities could explain the formation of the cooperating community. We also mixed all four auxotrophs together, both in a 1:1 mixture, as well as in the ratio observed from the community and performed co-culturing both with and without co-cultivation before spotting;\u00a0These attempts did not result in successful co-growth either (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 4</a>). Hence, by exploiting plasmid segregation to overcome culturing and allowing the\u00a0community to self-establish, heterogeneous yeast colonies were formed, which could sustain exponential growth under nutrient limitation, despite the majority of cells being auxotrophic for at least one metabolite. These co-growing cells could therefore overcome metabolic deficiencies through cooperative metabolism, demonstrating that yeast possesses metabolite exchange capacities at a growth relevant quantity."

In liquid media, lag phase was prolonged, and the maximum specific growth rate (\u00b5max) was slightly reduced compared to the genetically prototrophic YSBN5 or pHLUM cells (0.17 OD<sub>595</sub>/hr vs 0.20 and 0.21 OD<sub>595</sub>/hr, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> <i>right</i>).

Finally, we tested to what extent cell death occurs in the cooperating community. Both a wild-type (YSBN5) and a SeMeCo culture were grown to exponential phase and cells were counted. Then, the cultures were plated on SC media and the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) determined. The CFU count was nearly equal between SeMeCo and YSBN5, and similar to a 1:1 relationship to the cell count measured prior to spotting (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

For this, the community was re-established with alternative plasmids that express the fluorescent protein markers CFP (cyan fluorescent protein), Venus (yellow fluorescent protein), Sapphire (a UV-excitable green fluorescent protein [<a href=\"#bib38\">Sheff and Thorn, 2004</a>]), and mCherry (red fluorescent protein) coupled to the auxotrophic markers <i>HIS3, URA3, LEU2</i>, and <i>MET15</i>, respectively (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bilsland et al., 2013</a>). Segregation of the \u00a0labelled plasmids were within the same range, although not identical to the original pRS and p400 plasmids (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Images were acquired with\u00a0a SP5 on a DMI6000 inverted microscope (Leica,\u00a0Wetzlar,\u00a0Germany)\u00a0and show the underside of a live two day micro-colony which had, prior to imaging, been growing on minimal media (SM). In our hands, the Sapphire-<i>LEU2</i> fluorescence was also visible under the imaging conditions used to visualise Venus-<i>URA3</i>. For this reason, the Venus-<i>URA3</i> channel was removed from the colony image. The spatial heterogeneity of fluorescent markers in the micro-colony revealed that cells in SeMeCo unequally distribute over the macroscopic structure, and form regions where the biosynthesis of a particular metabolite dominates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). A prediction in truly cooperating communities is, however, whether complementary cells maintain physical proximity to each other, to oppose diffusion of exchanged metabolites (<a href=\"#bib29\">M\u00fcller et al., 2014</a>). Using computational image analyses of colony micrographs, we find that even when the most stringent cut-off was applied, complementary metabotypes across the community maintained an average distance (6.86 \u03bcm) of less than two cell diameters (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Cells are hence most likely to exchange the majority of metabolites with those maintaining close proximity. Despite these results, SeMeCo could, however, continue growth after disruption of this spatial structure in liquid media (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). To verify this assumption, SeMeCo was replicated for 7 days in liquid minimal media, as previously, with re-dilution every 2 days. Indeed, the liquid culture maintained a similar content of auxotrophs as obtained with colony grown SeMeCos (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The capacity of SeMeCos to overcome metabolic deficiencies through metabolic cooperation is hence not in essence bound to colonial growth."

These experiments revealed that within SeMeCo, 95.6% of cells belonged only to 8 of the 16 possible metabolic\u00a0combinations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We questioned whether this composition was the result of a stochastic event, however, the dominance of the same\u00a0metabotypes establish three times independently. Moreover, the eight successful metabotypes contributed to SeMeCo at comparable percentages (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> inset). Using our segregation rate model as well as growth rate data, we could rule out this colony composition being a result of (i) varying plasmid segregation rate, (ii) the number or type of auxotrophy, or (iii) differences in growth rates. First, a community composition calculated on the basis of the experimentally determined plasmid segregation values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) showed zero correlation with the actual population composition (r\u00b2 = 0.051) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Second, all histidine, leucine, uracil, or methionine auxotrophies, as well as all plasmid numbers (1 to 4) were found amongst both the frequent and rare metabotypes. For instance, while single uracil (<i>HIS3, LEU2, MET15, ura3\u2206</i>; 19.7%) or leucine (<i>HIS3, URA3, MET15, leu2\u2206;</i> 11.1%) auxotrophs were amongst the most frequent cells, their methionine-deficient counterparts (<i>HIS3, URA3, LEU2, met15\u2206</i>; 0.4%) were among the most rare (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Also, the high frequency of the dual auxotrophs <i>LEU2, MET15, his3\u2206, ura3\u2206</i> (8.1%) and <i>HIS3, MET15, leu2\u2206, ura3\u2206</i> (10.1%), contrasts with the rareness of the other dual auxotrophs (<i>HIS3, URA3, leu2\u2206, met15\u2206 (</i>1.1%), <i>MET15, URA3, leu2\u2206, his3\u2206</i> (0.2%), <i>URA3, LEU2, his3\u2206, met15\u2206\u00a0</i>(0.5%), and <i>LEU2, HIS3, ura3\u2206, met15\u2206</i> (0.6%)). Thus, the number of plasmids or type of auxotrophy a cell had did not indicate whether a cell-type would be rare or frequent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Finally, the growth rate of 16 strains, carrying the same marker and supplement combination that replicates the 16 metabotypes (<a href=\"#bib28\">M\u00fclleder et al., 2012</a>) did not distinguish the depleted from the selected metabotypes either (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

If this interpretation is correct, it would imply that a different pressure to cooperate would result in a different SeMeCo composition. To test this hypothesis, we focussed on uracil, as mass spectrometry had detected an increase in uracil concentration in the SeMeCo colony exometabolome, indicating that uracil is the most limiting metabolite (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2G</a> <i>right</i> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3Bii</a>). SeMeCos established on uracil adapted a different composition, resulting from a dramatic decline in cells needed to produce uracil. Importantly, this included the prototroph with its total content in the community decreasing from 26.7% in the original SeMeCo to solely 3.0%, so that 97.0% of cells were cooperating auxotrophs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Hence, SeMeCo colonies establish a population that is dynamic to changes in the external metabolite pool, and can persist in a state with virtually all cells being genetically auxotrophic for at least one essential metabolite."

In bacteria, a subset of such metabolite exchanges are of a cooperative nature in the sense that all exchange partners profit from this situation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Oliveira et al., 2014</a>), whereas for the majority of eukaryotic organisms, metabolite exchange strategies remain unclear. Despite yeast auxotrophs being viable in supplemented and rich media (<a href=\"#bib28\">M\u00fclleder et al., 2012</a>), in the absence of amino acid supplementation, they fail to complement metabolic deficiencies in several pairs or higher\u00a0order co-culture experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, [<a href=\"#bib29\">M\u00fcller et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shou et al., 2007</a>]), a clear difference to bacterial studies, where similar experiments were effective (<a href=\"#bib15\">Foster and Bell, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Freilich et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Harcombe, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Pande et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ramsey et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Vetsigian et al., 2011</a>). This led to speculations that yeast might, in contrast to many bacterial species, lack the required export capacities to enable growth relevant exchange of intermediary metabolites such as amino acids and nucleobases (<a href=\"#bib39\">Shou et al., 2007</a>). Analysing the intra-colony exometabolome we could, however, detect the required metabolites; in fact, we found that cells within a colony are surrounded by a rich exometabolome. We also found that yeast would efficiently exploit the nutrients when available, to the extent that they solely rely on these extracellular metabolites. This result implied that metabolite exchange among co-growing yeast cells is frequent by nature; the lack of complementation in the co-culture experiments could thus reflect a limit of the experiment itself, and not represent the metabolite exchange capacities of yeast cells."

The progressive loss of prototrophy allowed cells to maintain cell growth on the basis of metabolite exchange, resulting in a community with 73% auxotrophy, which increased to 97% upon supplementation with the most limiting metabolite, uracil. Despite its dominant auxotrophic composition, the SeMeCo community could maintain a wild-type like exometabolome, metabolic efficiency, as well as cell viability, implying that this type of cooperation is a robust physiological property. Hence yeast's natural metabolite export and import capacities are wholly sufficient to support co-growth on the basis of metabolite exchange."

This is consistent with the notion that losing more metabolic genes reduces biochemical capabilities and does\u00a0not add new ones. The key of the SeMeCo system is instead to allow the progressive self-establishment of the community starting from the single cell (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Metabolic feedback regulatory systems therefore do not inhibit metabolite export in general but prevent cooperative co-growth when already pre-established co-cultures are mixed (<a href=\"#bib29\">M\u00fcller et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shou et al., 2007</a>). A possible role of these mechanisms could perhaps prevent the spread of foreign, potentially cheating, cells that derive from a competing yeast colony. We could replicate behaviour which is in favour of such an assumption; By spiking into SeMeCo a cell culture possessing the same genotype as a frequent (<i>HIS3 LEU2 ura3\u0394 MET15</i>) and rare (<i>his3\u0394 leu2\u0394 URA3 MET15</i>) genotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), we observed that both genotypes were rapidly depleted from the pre-established SeMeCo, irrespective of the frequency of the respective genotype in SeMeCo (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

This indicates that this quantitatively defined community composition was most effective in metabolic cooperation. This finding may close an important gap in the understanding of the evolution of multicellularity; If a defined composition is most effective in cooperative growth, a selection advantage could be provided by any sort of physical bonding which can maintain cooperation partners in the defined equilibria, and would in addition, provide additional protection against the invasion of cheating cell types. Indeed, the exometabolome data implies that the number of metabolite exchange interactions among co-growing cells could be significant. The colony exometabolome contained a vast array of biomolecules, including the majority of amino acids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Castrillo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Paczia et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Silva and Northen, 2015</a>). The finding that yeast cells prefer uptake over synthesis of amino acids and uracil, even when they are genetically prototrophic, shows that exchange interactions will readily establish once the cellular environment has acquired a critical concentration of metabolites. This has implications for the interpretation of metagenomic studies and cheating/benefactor experiments, as for this reason, it cannot be concluded from the genetic presence or absence of a single metabolic pathway, or from following the synthesis of a single metabolite, how many other metabolites are being exchanged as well."

This implies that these features are a natural property of yeast and raises the question of why natural yeast communities are not composed of co-growing, genetic, auxotrophs. To answer this question, one needs to keep in mind that possessing metabolic\u00a0genes in the genome is not equal to the pathway being constantly active; Indeed, prototrophs can flexibly switch from self-synthesis to amino acid uptake (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Being genetically prototrophic hence gives a higher level of metabolic flexibility, as prototrophic cells can re-activate a synthetic pathway when required. Unlike in SeMeCo, the genotype of a cell in a natural community is not in essence reflecting its metabotype\u00a0or\u00a0its\u00a0metabolic\u00a0role\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0community. Additionally, the natural life cycle of yeast involves the formation of endospores, which are important for enduring starvation, and to spread between habitats. Without a prototrophic genotype, a single spore can no longer establish a colony on its own as genetic auxotrophy would interrupt the yeast life cycle. Second, only a fraction of the natural yeast life cycle occurs under exponential growth that requires abundant carbohydrate and nitrogen supply. The maintenance of a prototrophic genotype both in <i>S. pombe</i> and in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> wild isolates (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jeffares et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Liti et al., 2009</a>) is hence fully compatible with the presence of elaborate amino acid and nucleotide exchange mechanisms."

A majority of yeast genetic experiments are conducted in auxotrophic strains, requiring amino-acid supplemented or rich media compositions. Important parts of biosynthetic metabolism (amino acid biosynthesis can account for up to 50% of metabolic flux towards biomass) may have thus stayed silent in a significant amount of functional genomics experiments. The effects of metabolic\u2013genetic interactions on cellular physiology could thus substantially exceed our current knowledge and could be discovered upon switching to minimal nutrient supplementations. In this context, SeMeCos are simple to handle, establish rapidly and are easy to analyse, and therefore represent an effective and broadly applicable eukaryotic model system to study both cooperativity and effects of metabolism in the laboratory."

Composed of auxotrophic cell types that are non-viable on their own, SeMCo communities were able to overcome metabolic deficiencies and maintain metabolite concentrations and robustness similar to wild-type cells. Additionally, cooperation had imposed different metabolic roles on contributing cells.

To me, the most important question is how important and realistic the findings are for natural conditions. This particular experiment and the establishment of SeMeCos represents a scenario that is not very realistic in nature, where all the genes are maintained more or less stably in the genome instead of residing on unstable plasmids. The authors find that auxotrophic mutants that are mixed together do not seem able to develop some sort of mutualistic community. Moreover, in natural conditions, exchange of metabolites between yeast cells may not be very relevant, since if it were, one would expect that feral yeast colonies or communities would contain a very high rate of (different) auxotrophs? This also makes me wonder whether SeMeCo's develop mostly because of the cost of maintaining the plasmids, rather than a benefit of losing specific metabolic pathways to specialize in others? Last but not least, I also wonder whether the lab yeast strain BY4741, a derivative of S288C, which is known to be impaired in several mechanisms related to community formation (biofilms, pseudohyphal growth, mats\u2026), is a wise choice for these experiments."

Firstly, I would argue to repeat the key experiments in a strain that is capable of forming communities, like for example <i>Sigma1278b</i>. At first sight, this might seem like a prohibitive amount of work, but it is not since it simply entails using some of the available auxotrophs (or generating a few new ones through transformation) to see if they can support each other in liquid suspension, colonies or biofilms/mats. If so, this would mute a lot of doubts (including whether the cost of maintaining a plasmid is a player). Second, I would also suggest transforming Sigma with (at least two of) the plasmids to investigate if and how this strain realizes SeMeCo's similar to S288c. If the authors decide to follow this suggestion, I would also argue for the inclusion of constitutively expressed fluorescent markers, so that they can easily count the different lineages through cytometry and also follow their spatial distributions in colonies/biofilms (see second remark below)."

Perhaps one way to tackle this is to let cultures grow well into stationary phase and/or add a certain number of dead cells and monitor if and how this changes the dynamics. Another way would be to investigate colonies, as it is known that cells in the center of colonies experience starvation and cell death (see for example work by Palkova and colleagues)."

The key trick is to allow those communities to self-establish from a single cell initially auxotrophic for synthesis of three amino acids and uracil in which auxotrophy is covered by complementing plasmids. Each of these plasmids can be lost stochastically during cell division, leading to a mixture of possible phenotypes. The authors show that such stochastic plasmid loss leads to the emergence of heterogeneous colonies where auxotrophic neighbors grow and exchange metabolites between each other. It is a clever approach leading to a neat observation and the manuscript describes a lot of experimental work. My biggest problem with this story is that there is no attempt to get at the underlying mechanism and to understand just how SeMeCos differ from cells in co-culture."

I understand the authors' argument that feral yeasts often do not show auxotrophies because they may only rarely grow exponentially and because they may go through sexual cycles where they need to be able to survive and divide as single haploid cells.

However, only a single gene mutation (<i>FLO1</i>) prevents the assembly of biofilm-like structures in S228c (flocculation), so metabolically, the strain is completely capable of forming these types of communities (Smukalla et al., 2008). Although <i>Sigma1278b</i> is capable of biofilm formation in a growth-media dependent manner, it remains a very close relative to S288c, with a largely identical genome, similar metabolic capacities, and a long lab history on its own (http://wiki.yeastgenome.org/index.php/History_of_Sigma). We therefore chose to replicate the key experiments in a totally different yeast species, as these experiments not only exclude that the findings are specific to BY4741, but also indicate evolutionary conservation.

These results are also essential for interpreting and improving results from metabolic modelling approaches such as flux balance analysis, that intuitively assume cell-autonomous functionality of intermediary metabolism and, at present, do not include transport reactions or assume regular metabolite exchange between cells. For biotechnology, the potential is huge as well, as SeMeCos offer a simple system for establishing cooperative communities; these could be very efficient for the production of cell-toxic substances, as the burden can be shared between cells."

Nutrient recycling from dying cells can play a significant role in chronological ageing experiments, where cells are kept for days or weeks in stationary growth phase and cell death becomes substantial (i.e., studied by Palkov\u00e1 and Longo labs). The phenotype, 'adaptive re-growth', can subsequently arise in these stationary ageing yeast cultures as a result of cell lysis. In stationary bacterial cultures, a similar phenotype also occurs, known as 'growth advantage in stationary phase' (GASP). In these stationary cultures, cell growth that is explained through recycling from dying cells, but the novo biomass is not formed. This is the clear difference between these scenarios and our experimental set-up: In our case we can say for certain that de novo synthesis explains cell growth, as we work under exponential growth conditions, where biomass and with it, the total amount of histidine, leucine, methionine, and uracil, doubles with every cell division. Recycling of nutrients from dying cells could \u2013 at best \u2013 maintain biomass, but never double it exponentially; so on minimal media, all new gained biomass is for certain explained by de novo synthesis. Together with detecting no relevant amount of cell death as expected for an exponential culture Figure 8, we conclude that nutrient release through cell death is overall not relevant for the growth of SeMeCos."

This particular experiment and the establishment of SeMeCos represents a scenario that is not very realistic in nature, where all the genes are maintained more or less stably in the genome instead of residing on unstable plasmids. The authors find that auxotrophic mutants that are mixed together do not seem able to develop some sort of mutualistic community. Moreover, in natural conditions, exchange of metabolites between yeast cells may not be very relevant, since if it were, one would expect that feral yeast colonies or communities would contain a very high rate of (different) auxotrophs?

The critical question for point B), is hence if cells would gain additional advantage by losing this flexibility, and enter a situation were co-growth of different genotypes becomes an obligate situation. One needs to see the answer to this question in the context of the natural life cycle of yeast. This involves a sexual cycle and the formation of endospora, important to endure long periods of starvation, and to spread between habitats. If a yeast cell would lose a prototrophic genotype, a single spora cannot any longer establish a colony on its own. Loss of genetic prototrophy would thus negatively affect the natural life cycle of yeast, with deleterious consequences to its survival, spreading between environments, and evolvability (interruption of genetic recombination, etc.). So even if exchanging metabolites is advantageous when cell grow in a community, there are good reasons for keeping the genes in the genome that allow metabolic flexibility when required and for completing the sexual cycle. The existence and activity of metabolite exchange strategies coupled with the ability to turn biosynthetic pathways on and off, is thus fully compatible with maintaining a prototrophic genome. Perhaps, higher organisms are a good example for that. As humans we obtain all amino acids through our food, yet we maintain biosynthetic pathways for eleven of them, so that we can flexibly activate these pathways when our diet or age requires that. For yeast, the majority (but not all) natural isolates keep genetic prototrophy, both in <i>S. pombe</i> and in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (Jeffares et al., 2015; Liti et al., 2009).

The authors present an impressive number of controls and perform a detailed analysis of the established community. So overall this is a sound paper and I do not really have any specific comments to the Results and Discussion. However, I am a little puzzled about the rationale of this work. It is not clear what we are learning in terms of new biology from the study. It is an interesting observation that both phototrophs and auxotrophs take up metabolites at the same rate, but I think this has been observed before.

I understand the authors' argument that feral yeasts often do not show auxotrophies because they may only rarely grow exponentially and because they may go through sexual cycles where they need to be able to survive and divide as single haploid cells.
