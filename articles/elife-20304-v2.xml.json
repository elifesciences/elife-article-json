We find that cholesterol is not just necessary but also sufficient to activate signaling by the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, a prominent cell-cell communication system in development. Cholesterol influences Hh signaling by directly activating Smoothened (SMO), an orphan GPCR that transmits the Hh signal across the membrane in all animals. Unlike many GPCRs, which are regulated by cholesterol through their heptahelical transmembrane domains, SMO is activated by cholesterol through its extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Residues shown to mediate cholesterol binding to the CRD in a recent structural analysis also dictate SMO activation, both in response to cholesterol and to native Hh ligands. Our results show that cholesterol can initiate signaling from the cell surface by engaging the extracellular domain of a GPCR and suggest that SMO activity may be regulated by local changes in cholesterol abundance or accessibility."

We find that cholesterol is not just necessary but also sufficient to activate signaling by the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, a prominent cell-cell communication system in development. Cholesterol influences Hh signaling by directly activating Smoothened (SMO), an orphan GPCR that transmits the Hh signal across the membrane in all animals. Unlike many GPCRs, which are regulated by cholesterol through their heptahelical transmembrane domains, SMO is activated by cholesterol through its extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Residues shown to mediate cholesterol binding to the CRD in a recent structural analysis also dictate SMO activation, both in response to cholesterol and to native Hh ligands. Our results show that cholesterol can initiate signaling from the cell surface by engaging the extracellular domain of a GPCR and suggest that SMO activity may be regulated by local changes in cholesterol abundance or accessibility."

Damage to these communication systems is often seen in degenerative disorders and in cancer. The Hedgehog signaling pathway is one of a handful of these critical systems. Reduced Hedgehog signals can lead to birth defects, while excessive Hedgehog signals can lead to skin and brain cancers. Cells transmit the Hedgehog signal by releasing a protein into their surroundings, where it can influence neighboring cells. Despite years of study, it is not understood how the Hedgehog signal is transmitted from the outside to the inside of a receiving cell."

It plays an important role in modulating the function of cell-surface receptors, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest class of receptors that transduce signals across the plasma membrane, and antigen receptors on immune cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burger et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pucadyil and Chattopadhyay, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Swamy et al., 2016</a>). The structures of several GPCRs reveal cholesterol molecules tightly associated with the heptahelical transmembrane domain (7TMD) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cherezov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Ruprecht et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wu et al., 2014</a>). Cholesterol can influence GPCR stability, oligomerization and ligand affinity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fahrenholz et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gimpl et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Prasanna et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pucadyil and Chattopadhyay, 2004</a>). Cholesterol also organizes membrane microdomains, or \u2018rafts,\u2019 containing proteins and lipids that function as platforms for the detection and propagation of extracellular signals (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</a>). In all of these cases cholesterol plays a permissive role; however, it is not sufficient to trigger signaling on its own. Could cholesterol play a more instructive role\u2014 is it sufficient, not just necessary, to initiate signaling from the plasma membrane?"

Multiple seemingly unrelated links have been described between cholesterol and Hh signaling (summarized in [<a href=\"#bib23\">Eaton, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Incardona and Eaton, 2000</a>]). While the best-defined role for cholesterol is in the biogenesis of Hh ligands (<a href=\"#bib52\">Porter et al., 1996</a>), it also plays an independent role in the reception of Hh signals. Pharmacological or genetic depletion of cholesterol reduces cellular responses to Hh ligands, which has led to the view that cholesterol is <i>permissive</i> for Hh signaling (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blassberg et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cooper et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cooper et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Incardona et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Incardona and Roelink, 2000</a>). Distinct from these previous observations, we find that an acute increase in plasma membrane cholesterol is <i>sufficient</i> to activate Hh signaling. Thus, cholesterol can initiate signals from the cell surface by acting as an activating ligand for a GPCR family protein."

This experimental approach was inspired by previous studies of the cholesterol sensor SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2002</a>). The Hh signaling activity of cholesterol was exquisitely stereoselective\u2014 neither its enantiomer (<i>ent</i>-cholesterol) nor an epimer with an inverted configuration only at the 3-hydroxy position (<i>epi</i>-cholesterol) could activate Hh target genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Enantioselectivity was consistent with cholesterol acting through a chiral binding pocket on a protein target, rather than by altering membrane properties (<a href=\"#bib18\">Covey, 2009</a>). Hh signaling activity was also lost when either the number or the position of double bonds in the tetracyclic sterol nucleus were altered in 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) and lathosterol, two endogenous biosynthetic precursors of cholesterol. Interestingly, desmosterol, another immediate biosynthetic precursor of cholesterol that contains an additional double-bond in the iso-octyl chain, retained signaling activity. This structure-activity relationship points to the tetracyclic ring, conserved between cholesterol and desmosterol, as the critical structural element required for activity. We cannot exclude the possibility that desmosterol activated signaling because it was rapidly converted to cholesterol in cells. These strict structural requirements suggest a specific, protein-mediated effect of cholesterol on the Hh signaling pathway and further exclude the possibility that signaling activity is due to extraction of an inhibitor from cells by M\u03b2CD (present at the same concentration in all the sterol complexes tested in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

Cholesterol has been shown to be necessary for SMO activation, based on experiments using inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis and high concentrations of naked M\u03b2CD to strip the plasma membrane of cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cooper et al., 2003</a>). Impaired SMO activation caused by cholesterol deficiency has also been noted in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), a congenital malformation syndrome caused by defects in the enzyme that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blassberg et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cooper et al., 2003</a>). In contrast to our results, the SMO CRD is dispensable for this permissive role of cholesterol. The depletion of cholesterol reduces signaling by SMO mutants lacking the entire CRD (<a href=\"#bib45\">Myers et al., 2013</a>) or carrying mutations in the CRD binding-groove (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blassberg et al., 2016</a>). By analogy with other GPCRs, these permissive effects are likely to be mediated by the SMO 7TMD."

Cholesterol engages a hydrophobic groove on the surface of the CRD, a groove that was previously shown to mediate the activating influence of oxysterols (<a href=\"#bib45\">Myers et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nachtergaele et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Nedelcu et al., 2013</a>) and represents an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for detecting hydrophobic small-molecule ligands (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bazan and de Sauvage, 2009</a>). An analogous mechanism is present in the Frizzled family of Wnt receptors, where the Frizzled CRD binds to the palmitoleyl group of Wnt ligands, an interaction that is required for Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib35\">Janda et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the instructive effects of cholesterol revealed in our present study and the permissive effects of cholesterol reported previously map to distinct, separable SMO domains. Our observation that M\u03b2CD:cholesterol is sufficient to activate SMO through its CRD is in agreement with a report published recently during the review process of our manuscript (<a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al., 2016</a>)."

First, the method of delivery, as an inclusion complex with M\u03b2CD, is critical to presenting cholesterol, a profoundly hydrophobic and insoluble lipid, in a bioavailable form capable of activating Smo. Even clear solutions of cholesterol in the absence of carriers like M\u03b2CD contain microcrystalline deposits or stable micelles that sequester cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib29\">Haberland and Reynolds, 1973</a>). In contrast, side-chain oxysterols, which harbor an additional hydroxyl group, are significantly more hydrophilic and soluble in aqueous solutions, shown by their\u00a0~\u00a050 fold faster transfer rates between membranes (<a href=\"#bib65\">Theunissen et al., 1986</a>). Second, cholesterol levels in the cell are difficult to manipulate because they are tightly controlled by elaborate homeostatic signalling mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown and Goldstein, 2009</a>). M\u03b2CD:cholesterol inclusion complexes have been shown to be unique in their ability to increase the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane rapidly at timescales (~1\u20134 hr) at which cytoplasmic signaling pathways operate (<a href=\"#bib14\">Christian et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yancey et al., 1996</a>). Other methods of delivery using low density lipoprotein particles and lipid dispersions, or mutations in genes regulating cholesterol homeostasis, function on a much slower time scale and are thus more likely to be confounded by indirect effects given the myriad cellular processes affected by cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib14\">Christian et al., 1997</a>). Finally, the bell-shaped Hh signal-response curve (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) implies that M\u03b2CD:cholesterol must be delivered in a relatively narrow, intermediate concentration range (1\u20132 mM) to observe optimal activity, with higher (&gt;5 mM) concentrations commonly used to load cells with cholesterol producing markedly lower levels of signaling activity."

                        "text": "Our results are particularly informative in light of the recently solved crystal structure of a\u00a0SMO protein\u00a0containing the CRD, linker domain and entire 7TMD but lacking the cytoplasmic tail (hereafter called SMO\u25b3C) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Byrne et al., 2016</a>). SMO\u25b3C was unexpectedly found to contain a cholesterol ligand in its CRD groove. Cholesterol also made key contacts with the linker domain and third extracellular loop of the 7TMD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and molecular dynamics simulations showed that cholesterol can stabilize these extracellular regions of SMO (<a href=\"#bib9\">Byrne et al., 2016</a>). However, the function of this bound cholesterol, whether it is an agonist, antagonist or co-factor, remains an important unresolved question in SMO regulation. Structure-guided point mutations in CRD residues that form hydrogen-bonding interactions with the 3\u03b2-hydroxyl of cholesterol, reduced signaling by cholesterol (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), making it likely that cholesterol activates SMO by binding to the CRD in the pose revealed in the structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Thus, the cholesterol-bound SMO structure recently reported by our groups may very well represent an active-state conformation of the CRD. A comparison of this cholesterol-bound structure with a structure of inactive SMO bound to the potent 7TMD antagonist vismodegib (which lacks cholesterol in the CRD groove) revealed a conformational change that may drive SMO activation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Byrne et al., 2016</a>). Cholesterol binding is predicted to induce a clockwise rotation of the CRD on the 7TMD pedestal, perhaps driving SMO activation by a rearrangement of contacts between the CRD and the 7TMD. A caveat to this model is that it depends on a structural comparison with SMO\u25b3C bound to a synthetic antagonist and not with un-liganded SMO\u25b3C, which has thus far eluded crystallization."

We disagree with this model for several reasons. First, these structures do not contain the linker domain and the entire 7TMD, both of which make critical contacts with cholesterol and the CRD, and hence cannot reveal changes in orientation between the CRD and the 7TMD that are essential to understanding how CRD ligands communicate with the 7TMD. Second, all structures of the SMO CRD (with the exception of the <i>Xenopus apo</i>-CRD) are conformationally identical (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), regardless of whether they contain a bound ligand (cholesterol-bound SMO\u25b3C, cyclopamine-bound CRD or 20(S)-OHC-bound CRD) or not (<i>Danio rerio apo</i>-CRD or vismodegib-bound SMO\u25b3C) and regardless of whether they were crystallized by standard vapor diffusion (the CRD structures) or lipidic cubic phase methods (the SMO\u25b3C structures). Hence this conserved conformation, seen in both the isolated CRD and the more physiological SMO\u25b3C molecule, is unlikely to be an artefact of crystal packing as suggested by these authors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al., 2016</a>). Finally, a careful inspection of the crystal lattice contacts in the <i>Xenopus apo</i>-SMO structure (PDB ID 5KZZ) revealed that the region of the proposed conformational change is partially disordered (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and involved in the coordination of a zinc ion together with a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal, a very tight, near-covalent interaction that was likely driving crystal formation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Since the crystallization solution for the <i>Xenopus apo</i>-SMO, but not the solutions used to crystallize the sterol-bound CRDs, contained 200 mM zinc acetate, the altered conformation observed may have been induced by a non-physiological, zinc-promoted crystal contact (<a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al., 2016</a>)."

SHH was used at saturating concentrations; however, we could not assess the effects of M\u03b2CD:cholesterol at saturating doses, because the downward phase of the bell-shaped dose-response curve (in cultured fibroblasts, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and cell toxicity (in neural progenitors) proved to be dose-limiting. Aside from these technical considerations related to delivery, other possibilities for lower activity include the observation that M\u03b2CD:cholesterol did not induce the high-level accumulation of SMO in primary cilia (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and the possibility that a different ligand regulates high-level signaling by SMO. Mutations in the 7TMD binding-site do not alter the constitutive or SHH-induced signaling activity of SMO, which has led to view that this site does not regulate physiological signaling (<a href=\"#bib45\">Myers et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yauch et al., 2009</a>).

Since cholesterol is a ubiquitous component of cellular membranes that affects many cellular processes, PTCH1-induced changes in cholesterol are likely to be confined to a specific membrane compartment. The base of the cilium is a good candidate for such a compartment because PTCH1 is localized most prominently at the ciliary base in Hh-responsive tissues in the mouse embryo (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rohatgi et al., 2007</a>) and because most Hh pathway components, from PTCH1 to the GLI transcription factors, are found in and around primary cilia (<a href=\"#bib5\">Briscoe and Th\u00e9rond, 2013</a>). Two key questions must be answered before endogenous cellular cholesterol can be considered the elusive second messenger that communicates the Hh signal from PTCH1 to SMO: Do Hh ligands alter cholesterol abundance or activity? and Is cholesterol a substrate for the predicted transporter activity of PTCH1? Answering these questions will require developing or adapting tools to measure and perturb cholesterol in specific cellular compartments and an assessment of the biochemical activities of purified SMO and PTCH1 reconstituted into cholesterol-containing membranes."

Background correction was applied on a per cilia basis by subtracting the background fluorescence from the cilia fluorescence."

For each experiment, coverslips from each condition were grown, collected, and processed together to ensure that the cells were fixed and stained for the same duration of time. To ensure uniformity in imaging, the gain, offset, and laser power settings on the microscope were held constant for each antibody. At least 15 images were taken per condition. To ensure all cells were represented, z-stacks were acquired and counts were performed on the compressed images. Cell counts were conducted using the NIH ImageJ software suite with cell counter plugin. In total, 5000\u20136000 cells were analyzed per condition. The experiment was conducted independently a total of three times. Representative images shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> were processed equally using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe illustrator, and CorelDraw software."

Confluent cells were switched into 0.5% FBS DMEM to induce ciliogenesis for 24 hr. Cells were treated with indicated drugs dissolved in 0.5% FBS DMEM in duplicate. One sample was used to measure total protein by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA), and the second for total lipid extraction and subsequent cholesterol quantification. Cells were washed once with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), and harvested using a Corning cell lifter in PBS. The cell suspension was transferred to a 1.5 mL ependorf tube, centrifuged at 1000 x g and the PBS aspirated. Total lipids were extracted from the cell pellet by the addition of 200 \u03bcL of chloroform-methanol (2:1 vol/vol). To induce phase separation, 100 \u03bcL of PBS was added to the lipid extract and the sample was centrifuged at 5000 x g for 5 min. The organic layer was transferred to a fresh 1.5 mL eppendorf tube and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. Relative total free cholesterol was measured using the <i>Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit</i> (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. Lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mM dithithreitol, and Sigma Fast protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to disrupt the cell pellet. A ratio of total free cholesterol to total protein was used as a normalization method."

The hunt for a natural ligand for Smo has been long and largely unsuccessful, making this discovery an impactful advance for the field. Although cholesterol is not likely the sole molecule required for Smo activation (it is insufficient to induce Smo ciliary translocation or high-level signaling), it is an important player in physiological regulation of this GPCR."
