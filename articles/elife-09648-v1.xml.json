Synapses contain two pools of receptors, immobilized and diffusing receptors, both of which are confined to post-synaptic elements. Here we show that immobile and diffusing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are stabilized by distinct synaptic scaffolds at <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular junctions. Immobilized GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are stabilized by binding to FRM-3/EPB4.1 and LIN-2A/CASK. Diffusing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are stabilized by the synaptic adhesion molecules Neurexin and Neuroligin. Inhibitory post-synaptic currents are eliminated in double mutants lacking both scaffolds. Neurexin, Neuroligin, and CASK mutations are all linked to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Our results suggest that these mutations may directly alter inhibitory transmission, which could contribute to the developmental and cognitive deficits observed in ASD."

Synapses contain two pools of receptors, immobilized and diffusing receptors, both of which are confined to post-synaptic elements. Here we show that immobile and diffusing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are stabilized by distinct synaptic scaffolds at <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular junctions. Immobilized GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are stabilized by binding to FRM-3/EPB4.1 and LIN-2A/CASK. Diffusing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are stabilized by the synaptic adhesion molecules Neurexin and Neuroligin. Inhibitory post-synaptic currents are eliminated in double mutants lacking both scaffolds. Neurexin, Neuroligin, and CASK mutations are all linked to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Our results suggest that these mutations may directly alter inhibitory transmission, which could contribute to the developmental and cognitive deficits observed in ASD."

Several studies suggest that an important mechanism for modulating inhibitory transmission is altered abundance of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. In mammalian neurons, variation in the amplitude of miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) is caused by corresponding differences in the abundance of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at synapses (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nusser et al., 1997</a>). Long term potentiation of GABAergic transmission is associated with increased mIPSC amplitudes and increased GABA<sub>A</sub> abundance at synapses (<a href=\"#bib37\">Petrini et al., 2014</a>) while the converse effects are associated with long term depression (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bannai et al., 2009</a>)."

Like all synaptic receptors, GABA<sub>A</sub> diffusion is significantly reduced at synapses, resulting in accumulation of receptors at the synapse (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jacob et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Thomas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bannai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Petrini et al., 2014</a>). Local confinement of receptors at synapses is termed diffusional trapping and is mediated by binding to cytoplasmic scaffolds (<a href=\"#bib11\">Choquet and Triller, 2013</a>). The post-synaptic scaffold that immobilizes GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is proposed to consist of a ternary complex of Gephyrin, Neuroligin-2 (NL2), and collybistin (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jacob et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</a>). Gephyrin binds directly to the large cytoplasmic loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains (TM3-4 loop) of GABRA1 and 2 subunits (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tretter et al., 2008</a>), thereby confining these receptors at synapses (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jacob et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mukherjee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Saliba et al., 2012</a>).

These immobile receptors undergo dynamic exchange with diffusing receptors that are confined to synapses. These studies highlight several important questions. Do immobile and diffusing receptors both contribute to IPSCs? Current models propose that post-synaptic currents are mediated by immobilized receptors and synaptic plasticity is mediated by the dynamic exchange of receptors between the diffusing and immobile pools (<a href=\"#bib11\">Choquet and Triller, 2013</a>). It has not been possible to genetically test these models because mutations that selectively disrupt the two receptor pools are not available. What are the synaptic scaffolds that stabilize immobilized and diffusing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors? What controls the exchange between the two receptor pools?"

The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors found at these NMJs contain two subunits (UNC-49B and C) both encoded by the <i>unc-49</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bamber et al., 1999</a>). Mutants lacking UNC-49 receptors have defects in GABA-activated muscle currents, as assessed by recording miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) and muscle currents evoked by an exogenous GABA agonist (muscimol) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013E</a>). An mIPSC corresponds to the current evoked by the fusion of a single synaptic vesicle at a GABAergic NMJ and, consequently, measures the function of synaptic UNC-49 receptors. Muscimol activates all surface UNC-49 receptors (including non-synaptic receptors in the nerve cord and muscle cell bodies). The mIPSC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>) and muscimol-evoked current (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>) defects of <i>unc-49</i> mutants were rescued by a transgene expressing GFP-tagged UNC-49B receptor in body muscles. Muscimol-evoked currents were significantly larger in GFP-UNC-49B transgenic animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), presumably because this transgene is expressed at higher levels than the endogenous <i>unc-49</i> gene. These results demonstrate that the GFP-tag (inserted into the TM3-4 loop) did not impair UNC-49B receptor function."

To assess the mobility of synaptic UNC-49B receptors, we measured fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of GFP-UNC-49B puncta in the dorsal nerve cord (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013I</a>). FRAP assesses the mobility of proteins in vivo whereby increased mobility is indicated by increased FRAP. UNC-49B puncta that were co-localized with mCherry-tagged RAB-3 expressed in GABAergic motor neurons were considered synaptic. In wild type controls, 40% of UNC-49B puncta fluorescence was mobile in FRAP experiments, with recovery occurring several minutes after photobleaching (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>). GFP-UNC-49B puncta fluorescence could comprise receptors on the cell surface and those in intracellular organelles. To more accurately assess the mobility of surface receptors, we analyzed UNC-49B receptors containing a pH-sensitive GFP (pHluorin) tag in the ecto-domain (pH-UNC-49B). pHluorin fluorescence is quenched in intracellular acidic compartments (e.g., endosomes); consequently, pHluorin fluorescence primarily results from molecules in the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib29\">Miesenbock et al., 1998</a>). In wild type animals, 46% of pH-UNC-49B synaptic fluorescence recovered following photobleaching (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). Because similar mobile fractions were observed with the GFP and pHluorin tagged receptors, these results suggest that the majority of UNC-49B puncta fluorescence results from receptors in the plasma membrane. Collectively, these results suggest that UNC-49B synaptic puncta comprise a mixture of mobile (\u223c40% total) and immobilized (\u223c60% total) receptors on the cell surface.

A <i>lin-2</i> promoter construct expressed GFP in body muscles, indicating that LIN-2A may function in muscles (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). mCherry-tagged LIN-2A expressed in muscles formed puncta in the nerve cords and these LIN-2A puncta were co-localized with GFP-UNC-49B at NMJs, consistent with LIN-2A binding to FRM-3 at NMJs (Pearson's correlation R = 0.68 \u00b1 0.057, p = 0.04, n = 5) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Like <i>frm-3</i> mutants, <i>lin-2</i> mutants had decreased UNC-49B puncta fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>) and decreased mIPSC amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>), both implying that synaptic UNC-49 levels were decreased. mIPSC rates were unaltered in <i>lin-2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), indicating that pre-synaptic GABA release was unaffected. Muscimol-activated current was unaffected in <i>lin-2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), indicating that the <i>lin-2</i> puncta and mIPSC defects were not caused by decreased bulk expression or surface delivery of UNC-49 receptors. The <i>lin-2</i> puncta and mIPSC defects were rescued by transgenes restoring LIN-2A expression in body muscles but not by those expressed in GABAergic motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>). If LIN-2A and FRM-3 function together to localize UNC-49 receptors, <i>lin-2</i> and <i>frm-3</i> mutations should not have additive effects in double mutants. Consistent with this idea, UNC-49B puncta fluorescence and mIPSC amplitudes in <i>frm-3 lin-2</i> double mutants were not significantly different from those in either single mutant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>). Collectively, these results suggest that LIN-2A/CASK and FRM-3/EPB4.1 function together in body muscles to localize UNC-49B at NMJs but are not required for the expression or function of non-synaptic UNC-49 receptors."

To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured FRAP of UNC-49B puncta in the dorsal nerve cord (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In both <i>frm-3</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and <i>lin-2</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) mutants, GFP-UNC-49B FRAP was significantly increased (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The <i>frm-3</i> FRAP defect was rescued by transgenes restoring FRM-3 expression in body muscles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). A similar increase in FRAP was observed for pH-UNC-49B receptors in <i>frm-3</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). The GFP-UNC-49B transgene is likely to be expressed at higher levels than endogenous UNC-49. Over-expression could alter UNC-49B mobility at synapses. To address this possibility, we repeated the FRAP measurements using a single copy RFP-tagged UNC-49B transgene (<i>krSi2</i>) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pinan-Lucarre et al., 2014</a>). Using this single copy transgene, a similar increase in FRAP of RFP-UNC-49B was observed in <i>frm-3</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Increased FRAP suggests that synaptic UNC-49B receptors had increased ability to undergo exchange in the nerve cord, most likely due to increased diffusional mobility in the plasma membrane. These results suggest that LIN-2A and FRM-3 function as a scaffold that stabilizes an immobile pool of UNC-49 receptors in the plasma membrane at post-synaptic elements."

Prompted by these results, we tested the idea that post-synaptic Neuroligin also plays a role in confining UNC-49 receptors at synapses. Several results support this idea. First, an <i>nlg-1</i> promoter construct expressed GFP in body muscles (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hunter et al., 2010</a>), consistent with NLG-1 function in muscles. Second, mCherry-tagged NLG-1 expressed in body muscles was co-localized with GFP-tagged UNC-49B receptors at NMJs (Pearson's correlation R = 0.81 \u00b1 0.02, p = 0.01, n = 8) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Third, GFP-UNC-49B puncta fluorescence was significantly reduced in <i>nlg-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>), consistent with a decrease in total synaptic receptors.

The coefficient of variation (CV) of the mIPSC amplitudes was \u223c0.6\u20137 in wild type animals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>), which is similar to values reported for some mammalian CNS synapses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bekkers et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hanse and Gustafsson, 2001</a>). If quantal variability is dominated by diffusion of UNC-49 receptors in and out of the postsynaptic site, the mIPSC amplitude CV should scale inversely with the square root of receptor number. In this scenario, we expect that mutations decreasing UNC-49B punta fluorescence (e.g., <i>frm-3</i>, <i>lin-2</i>, and <i>nlg-1</i>) would produce corresponding increases in the CV of mIPSC amplitudes.

Fourth, pre-synaptic NRX-1\u03b1/Neurexin inhibits the immobilization of NLG-1 stabilized UNC-49B. Fifth, the FRM-3 and NLG-1 stabilized receptor pools both contribute to inhibitory synaptic transmission. Sixth, both scaffolds increase the variability of quantal responses. And seventh, all synaptic UNC-49 receptors can be explained by these two scaffolds. Below we discuss the significance of these findings."

These scaffolds define two pools of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors that function independently. In double mutants lacking both pools, immobilized synaptic UNC-49 receptors and mIPSCs are eliminated. Mobile receptors detected by FRAP in <i>frm-3 nlg-1</i> double mutants likely correspond to extra-synaptic receptors on the cell surface (which mediate muscimol-activated currents). Thus, the FRM-3 and NLG-1 scaffolds together account for all GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at the body wall NMJ. Consequently, the dynamics of GABA<sub>A</sub> levels at this synapse will be determined by the detailed biochemistry of these two scaffolds. Our results also suggest that synaptic receptors represent a small fraction of total surface UNC-49 receptors. Mutants lacking both scaffolds have no defect in total surface receptors (assessed by muscimol-activated currents). Thus, these scaffolds have no effect on the assembly, anterograde trafficking, and surface delivery of UNC-49 receptors. Instead, these scaffolds play a specific role in concentrating UNC-49 surface receptors at synapses."

For all synaptic phenotypes, <i>lin-2</i> defects were less severe than those observed in <i>frm-3</i> mutants, perhaps because LIN-2/CASK regulates UNC-49 targeting by modulating FRM-3 function. For example, prior studies suggest that ERM proteins equilibrate between active (open) and inactive (closed) conformations (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pearson et al., 2000</a>). It is possible that LIN-2/CASK binding stabilizes the active conformation of FRM-3. Collectively, these results suggest that ERM and CASK proteins play a conserved role in targeting neurotransmitter receptors. In each case, CASK and ERM proteins account for a subset of receptors confined to a synapse."

First, in double mutants lacking both scaffolds (i.e. <i>frm-3 nlg-1</i> double mutants), immobilized UNC-49B receptors and mIPSCs were both eliminated. This result implies that immobile UNC-49B receptors observed in <i>frm-3</i> single mutants are derived from the NLG-1-stabilized pool and that immobilization of these receptors does not require FRM-3. Second, mIPSC amplitudes and immobile synaptic UNC-49B levels are significantly increased in mutants lacking presynaptic NRX-1\u03b1. Both of these effects were abolished in <i>nrx-1; nlg-1</i> double mutants. These results suggest that pre-synaptic NRX-1\u03b1 inhibits immobilization of diffusing NLG-1-stabilized UNC-49 receptors. Trans-synaptic NRX-1\u03b1/NLG-1 complexes may confine mobile synaptic receptors via low affinity binding interactions with UNC-49B, or by sterically interfering with UNC-49B lateral diffusion (<a href=\"#bib44\">Santamaria et al., 2010</a>). Because NLG-1 stabilizes both forms of synaptic receptors, the contribution of the NLG-1 pool to post-synaptic currents could be mediated by immobilized or diffusing UNC-49 receptors (or a mixture of the two)."

Prior modelling studies suggest that the non-homogeneous distribution of synaptic receptors into nanoclusters has profound effects on synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib27\">MacGillavry et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nair et al., 2013</a>). Although these studies analyzed glutamatergic synapses, in the following we assume that similar principles apply to GABAergic synapses. Within post-synaptic elements, \u223c60% of receptors are localized in immobile nanoclusters (mean diameter 75 nm, mean receptor number 25) while the remaining \u223c40% are mobile and diffusely distributed (<a href=\"#bib27\">MacGillavry et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nair et al., 2013</a>). The effect of receptor nanoclusters on transmission results from the fact that a single synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion activates receptors in a subsynaptic domain. For glutamate, the domain of activated receptors is estimated to have diameter \u223c200 nm (<a href=\"#bib40\">Raghavachari and Lisman, 2004</a>). The size of the GABA domain has not been calculated, but is likely to be larger (due to the higher affinity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors). SV fusions at <i>C. elegans</i> cholinergic and GABAergic NMJs occur in an active zone with a diameter of 700 nm (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Watanabe et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the spatial extent of GABA in the synaptic cleft will vary depending on the location of the SV fusion event within the active zone (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barberis et al., 2011</a>). Consequently, quantal amplitude will vary depending on the proximity of the vesicle fusion site to the receptor nanocluster and the density of receptors in each nanocluster (<a href=\"#bib13\">Franks et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">MacGillavry et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nair et al., 2013</a>). By contrast, mobile (unclustered) receptors have lower but uniform surface density; consequently, mobile receptors are predicted to mediate smaller quantal responses that have lower CV (<a href=\"#bib27\">MacGillavry et al., 2013</a>). Our results are largely consistent with these modelling studies. The FRM-3 and NLG-1 scaffolds increase mIPSC amplitude and CV, presumably due to an increase in the number of UNC-49 nanoclusters at synapses or an increase in the number of receptors in each nanocluster."

To image GFP-UNC-49B, pH-UNC-49B, and RAB-3-mCherry, we used 0.5% power from a 473 nm (GFP) and 559 nm (mCherry) solid state diode laser. Five frames of GFP and mCherry signals were recorded prior to photobleaching. Photobleaching was achieved by one scan (90% power from the 473 nm laser) on a square region of interest (ROI, about 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 \u03bcm) that covered a single GFP punctum. GFP and mCherry signals were further recorded for 5 min at 0.2 frames/second. To eliminate motion artifacts, traces with more than 10% changes in mCherry signals were discarded. UNC-49B mobile fractions were calculated in MATLAB by fitting the data with a single exponential function, I<sub>frap</sub>(t) = A(1-e<sup>-\u03c4t</sup>), where A is reported as the mobile fraction.

Tong et al. employ in vivo approaches to demonstrate that there are mobile and immobile pools of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (UNC-49) at <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular junctions. In addition, they explore molecular mechanisms that control UNC-49 localization and report distinct phenotypes for two different scaffolds, one consisting of the trans-synaptic neurexin-neuroligin complex and one consisting of a cytoplasmic scaffold containing FRM-3 and LIN-2. Mutation of each scaffold individually produces specific phenotypes with respect to receptor mobility (assessed by FRAP) and synaptic transmission. Importantly, the authors find that FRM-3 and NLG-1, function in parallel to recruit GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to synapses, and that simultaneous inactivation of both scaffolds results in a near complete loss of GABAergic transmission and receptor stabilization at synapses."

The identification of a function for FRM-3 for synaptic UNC-49 concentration is novel and important. Moreover, an important concept advanced by this work is the presence of multiple systems that act in parallel to stabilize functionally different pools of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors at the same class of synapse. This concept is backed up by strong in vivo data, and is accompanied by specific molecular mechanisms that stabilize the two different pools of receptors."

As the mobility measurements are a central part of this study this issue needs to be addressed somewhere in the text.</i>"
