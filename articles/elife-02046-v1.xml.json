Here we identify a RNA binding pocket on WDR5, and discover a WDR5 mutant (F266A) that selectively abrogates RNA binding without affecting MLL complex assembly or catalytic activity. Complementation in ESCs shows that WDR5 F266A mutant is unable to accumulate on chromatin, and is defective in gene activation, maintenance of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, and ESC self renewal. We identify a family of ESC messenger and lncRNAs that interact with wild type WDR5 but not F266A mutant, including several lncRNAs known to be important for ESC gene expression. These results suggest that specific RNAs are integral inputs into the WDR5-MLL complex for maintenance of the active chromatin state and embryonic stem cell fates."

Here we identify a RNA binding pocket on WDR5, and discover a WDR5 mutant (F266A) that selectively abrogates RNA binding without affecting MLL complex assembly or catalytic activity. Complementation in ESCs shows that WDR5 F266A mutant is unable to accumulate on chromatin, and is defective in gene activation, maintenance of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, and ESC self renewal. We identify a family of ESC messenger and lncRNAs that interact with wild type WDR5 but not F266A mutant, including several lncRNAs known to be important for ESC gene expression. These results suggest that specific RNAs are integral inputs into the WDR5-MLL complex for maintenance of the active chromatin state and embryonic stem cell fates."

However, other enzymes\u2014often working with other enzymes, proteins and molecules called cofactors\u2014can modify the structure of the chromatin in a way that leads to changes in the expression of nearby genes."

A mutation in this pocket that blocks binding to lncRNA did not stop purified WDR5 protein from forming active enzyme complexes when tested in the lab. However, it seems that WDR5 needs to bind to the lncRNAs to function properly inside living cells. WDR5 binds to hundreds of lncRNAs within a cell, and the mutation that blocks this binding reduced both the amount of time that WDR5 protein survives in a cell and the amount of time it spends bound to chromatin. As such, this mutation seems to reduce the ability of the WDR5-enzyme complex to activate chromatin and \u2018switch on\u2019 genes."

Since different cell types have distinct patterns of active chromatin, the next challenge will be to understand whether different lncRNAs bind to WDR5 to switch on unique set of genes in each cell type."

The MLL family of H3K4 methylases are evolutionarily conserved (known as COMPASS in yeast and trithorax in <i>Drosophila</i>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Smith et al., 2011</a>), and <i>MLL</i> translocations are an important cause of human leukemias (<a href=\"#bib28\">Meyer et al., 2009</a>). Members of the MLL family encode single SET domain-containing H3K4 methylases, and are associated with WDR5, Ash2L, RbBP5, and additional proteins to regulate activity. Of the various cofactors that regulate MLL activity, WDR5 is a particularly important multifunctional adaptor protein that can discriminate posttranslational modifications on histone tails, as well as bind to the MLL complex to regulate gene activation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wysocka et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Migliori et al., 2012</a>). WDR5 is particularly important for mammalian embryonic stem cell (ESC) self renewal and maintenance of active chromatin for pluripotency genes, and WDR5 is required for efficient generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from differentiated somatic cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27a\">Li et al., 2012</a>)."

LncRNAs are capped, spliced, polyadenylated RNA transcripts ranging from several hundred to kilobases in length (<a href=\"#bib9\">Derrien et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Rinn and Chang, 2012</a>). Specific lncRNAs bind repressive or activating chromatin modification complexes, and localize these activities to specific gene loci (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib50\">Wang and Chang (2011)</a>). For example, the lncRNA XIST binds the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to cause histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation and silence the X chromosome for dosage compensation in females (<a href=\"#bib31\">Morey and Avner, 2011</a>). As another example, the lncRNA HOTAIR acts as a molecular scaffold, binding both PRC2 and the H3K4 demethylase LSD1 complex to silence hundreds of loci throughout the genome (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rinn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gupta et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tsai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chu et al., 2011</a>).

HOTTIP is an enhancer-like lncRNA of the human <i>HOXA</i> locus that coordinates expression of <i>HOXA9</i> to <i>HOXA13</i>, which are important for distal identity (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). HOTTIP RNA directly binds to the WDR5 protein to recruit the MLL H3K4 methylase complex to maintain H3K4me3. In addition, recent research has shown that the NeST lncRNA also binds WDR5 to upregulate IFN-\u03b3 expression through H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gomez et al., 2013</a>), suggesting the existence of multiple different enhancing lncRNAs that function via WDR5 interactions. Many enhancers and promoters often produce lncRNAs, and some of these lncRNAs have enhancer-like functions in the activation of nearby genes by binding the Mediator complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Orom et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lai et al., 2013</a>). Currently, it is believed that lncRNAs function by guiding localization of chromatin modification machinery as simple scaffolds. However, like coenzymes that modulate protein activity, it is possible that lncRNAs may affect protein function more directly."

Inability to bind RNAs does not affect MLL complex formation or catalytic activity in vitro. However, ability to bind RNAs is crucial for WDR5 function in cells. We find that WDR5 binds over a thousand endogenous RNAs and that RNA binding is essential for WDR5 maintenance of ESC pluripotency. Inability to bind RNAs greatly reduced duration of WDR5 protein and its occupancy on chromatin, impaired global H3K4me3 levels, and reduced expression of genes required for embryonic stem cell state. Overall, these results suggest an unexpected role for RNA binding in regulating the lifespan of epigenetic fates."

WDR5 is a barrel-shaped protein with several charged clefts on its surface, several of which are known to mediate protein\u2013protein interactions with MLL, histone H3 tail, or RbBP5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). We generated 19 WDR5 point mutants, expressed them in <i>Escherichia coli</i> as GST-fusion proteins, and purified them to homogeneity (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Four out of 19 mutants significantly reduced the ability to retrieve HOTTIP lncRNA in vitro: Y228A, L240A, K250A, and F266A. These WDR5 mutations defined a cleft between blades 5 and 6, partially encompassing the same surface previously described to bind RbBP5 amino acids 371\u2013381 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Odho et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Avdic et al., 2011</a>). Thus, a focal binding site defines the interaction between WDR5 and HOTTIP. To confirm that HOTTIP and RbBP5 bind to the same or overlapping sites on WDR5, we pre-incubated wild type GST-WDR5 with an excess of RbBP5 peptide (amino acids 371\u2013381) or control H3K4me3 peptide (amino acids 1\u201320), and then assayed for HOTTIP binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Whereas addition of H3K4me3 peptide had no effect, pre-incubation with RbBP5 peptide prevented HOTTIP binding to WDR5, thus confirming the shared binding cleft."

Furthermore, the F266A mutation actually increased RbBP5 binding (\u223c120%), suggesting that loss of binding to HOTTIP increases the ability to bind RbBP5. Consistent with the direct in vitro binding assay, both K250A and F266A mutations fully abrogated WDR5 binding to HOTTIP in vivo. In contrast, mutations at D107A and R181A showed minimal effects on WDR5-HOTTIP interactions. K250A and F266A did not affect the accumulation of HOTTIP lncRNA (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), and both negative controls U1 and HOTAIR did not enrich binding to WDR5 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

We believe that the former is the correct explanation based on the fact that fusion of F266A to a strong nuclear localization signal (GAL4 DNA binding domain) did not rescue its function (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

To close this gap, we identified WDR5\u2013bound RNAs in the ESC transcriptome. We tested UV-crosslinking with PAR-CLIP, but found that WDR5-RNA interactions have poor inherent UV crosslinking ability. We also found that standard RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) with FLAG epitope gave substantial background that hampered data interpretation. We then turned to RNA:protein immunoprecipitation in tandem (RIPiT), a method designed to identify RNA targets of RBP complexes with poor UV linking capacity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Singh et al., 2013</a>). Specifically, we fused tandem FLAG and hemagglutinin (HA) tags to wild type WDR5 or the F266A mutant. We established ESC lines expressing FLAG-HA tagged version of WT and F266A WDR5 at near endogenous expression levels, and FPLC analysis confirmed that both tandem-tagged WDR5 proteins quantitatively formed equivalent MLL-WDR5 protein complexes with endogenous subunits (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>)."

WDR5 WT, but not F266A or control, is associated with 1434 RNAs, comprised of mRNAs, lncRNAs, pri-miRNAs, and snoRNAs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>).

Restricting the analysis to the top quintile of WDR5-bound promoters still showed very limited overlap (100 out of 1849 promoters produce RNAs that also bind WDR5). Plotting average WDR5 ChIP-seq signal at ChIP-seq only or genes with both ChIP-seq and RIPiT-seq signal revealed that their WDR5 binding profiles are indistinguishable, highlighting the value of the RIPiT data set to reveal RNA involvement (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Two such lncRNAs, <i>lincRNA-1552</i> and <i>lincRNA-1592</i>, were shown to previously impact ESC biology, and <i>lincRNA-1552</i> is a key node in the pluripotency gene regulatory network. Depletion of <i>lincRNA-1552</i> led to mis-expression of \u223c100 mRNAs including <i>Nanog</i> and <i>Pou5f1</i>, and the promoter of <i>linc-1552</i> is bound by Pou5f1, Klf4, Nanog, Zfx, n-Myc, and c-Myc (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guttman et al., 2011</a>), suggesting a positive feedback loop has been described for other ESC lncRNAs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sheik Mohamed et al., 2010</a>). Further, the expression of <i>linc-1552</i> is repressed by retinoic acid-induced ESC differentiation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guttman et al., 2011</a>). This example highlights of how WDR5 can interact with a lincRNA important to ESC core transcription factor circuitry to control ESC pluripotency.

The discovery of many RNAs that bind WDR5 but not at its cognate genomic loci suggests that some WDR5-binding RNAs do not bind WDR5 as nascent transcripts, but only interact with WDR5 at a later stage of maturation and possibly for action in <i>trans</i>. Thus, WDR5 binds over 1400 endogenous RNAs in ESCs with potential for both <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> chromatin regulation."

These results suggest that in addition to their roles in recruiting protein complexes to specific genomic loci, lncRNA binding may also regulate the longevity of their interacting protein complexes <b>(</b><a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). When able to bind RNAs, wild type WDR5 displays a long nuclear and chromatin half-life, thus allowing formation of the MLL1 complex for H3K4me3 and gene activation of ESC pluripotency genes. However, when unable to bind RNAs, WDR5 mutant is rapidly turned over, causing loss of H3K4me3 and reduced expression of pluripotency genes. Thus, RNA binding may directly or indirectly regulate protein turnover for epigenetic regulation. It is possible that WDR5 protein that is not properly complexed or localized on chromatin are degraded by default, or WDR5 degradation may be a regulated mechanism (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakagawa and Xiong, 2011</a>). In our study, ability to bind RNAs extends WDR5 protein half-life by an additional 12 hr to approximately 24 hr, which starts to approach the time scale of an entire cell division cycle (especially in ESCs). With the extended protein longevity, lncRNAs may then regulate protein occupancy on chromatin during cellular maintenance, as well as aid in transmission of epigenetic regulators across cell generations. In this manner, lncRNAs may play crucial roles in regulating the multigenerational transmission of epigenetic proteins required for maintenance of cell state."

                                "text": "Given the dynamic regulation of nucleosome/chromatin mark turnover, protein stability also greatly affects the epigenetic landscape within the cell. Nucleosomes are turned over in a dynamic and regulated fashion at specific genomic loci (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dion et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mito et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Deal et al., 2010</a>), and histone tails can be proteolyzed during differentiation to erase prior histone modifications (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duncan et al., 2008</a>). In our example, the loss of stabilized WDR5 leads to an inability to maintain global H3K4me3 level, loss of expression of pluripotency regulators, and loss of ESC self renewal. Interestingly, the impact of F266A mutation on H3K4me3 level is modest in steady state conditions, but becomes quite striking with transcriptional shutoff of WDR5. We interpret these results to indicate that WDR5 stability is important for the robustness of the active chromatin state, exemplified by H3K4me3. In the absence of stabilized WDR5, H3K4me3 becomes much more sensitive to fluctuations in the transcriptional levels of WDR5 and likely other subunits of the MLL complex. Thus, these results reveal a new facet for RNA regulation in the connection between protein half-lives and the temporal transmission of epigenetic information via chromatin."

These results support and substantially broaden the scope of RNAs that may impact WDR5\u2019s function, including many lncRNAs and mRNAs that collectively may equal the copy number of WDR5 protein. The WDR5 F266A lncRNA-binding deficient mutant provides an ideal reagent to act as nonbinding control in the systematic genome-wide identification of functional WDR5-binding RNAs. Our data find that some of the recent discovered lncRNAs important for ESC self-renewal and pluripotency are associated with WDR5 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guttman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chakraborty et al., 2012</a>), including five lncRNAs with ESC phenotypes that do not bind repressive chromatin complexes. However, there are numerous additional RNAs that have not been characterized with respect to cell fate control or chromatin function, and thus suggest additional layers of regulation at the level of lncRNAs. Comparative analysis of genomic locations of WDR5 occupancy and WDR5 RNA binding suggest configurations that are compatible with both <i>cis</i> or <i>trans</i> regulation. Studies of other chromatin modification complexes have shown that a single complex (e.g., PRC2) can interact with thousands of RNAs, each of which can regulate a subset of genes targeted by the complex (<a href=\"#bib23\">Khalil et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhao et al., 2010</a>). Additionally, promiscuous binding of RNAs may allow PRC2 and other silencing factors to survey the genome and distinguish transcribed vs non-transcribed regions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Davidovich et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Di Ruscio et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kaneko et al., 2013</a>). A similar model likely applies to MLL and other gene activating complexes as well. The MLL complex possesses multiple components with RNA-binding capabilities. While WDR5 binds HOTTIP, NeST, and many other RNAs as shown here (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gomez et al., 2013</a>), MLL1 itself also has domains that bind RNAs in specific and nonspecific fashions (<a href=\"#bib25\">Krajewski et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bertani et al., 2011</a>). Cyp33, an allosteric regulator of MLL, also contains a RNA recognition motif, and its regulation of MLL can be controlled in an RNA-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hom et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). The presence of multiple RNA interaction domains suggests intimate and potentially multiple roles for RNAs in the control of H3K4me3 and programming active chromatin."

ESCs were fixed for 15 min with 1% formaldehyde in 1xPBS at 25\u00b0C. The reaction was stopped by added 1/10<sup>th</sup> the volume of 1.25M Glycine. For a typical RIPiT-seq experiment chromatin was prepared from \u223c1 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> cells by thawing previously crosslinked ESC pellets and resuspending in 880 \u03bcl of Nuclear Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) supplemented with fresh Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 10 mM PMSF, and RNaseOUT (1:100). Chromatin was sheared in a Covaris E220 ultrasonicator to a size of 200\u2013500 bp. The first IP was performed with 50 \u03bcl of FLAG-M2 agarose slurry (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 4 hr at 4\u00b0C on rotation. Samples were washed one time 1 ml in series at 4\u00b0C for 5 min each with the following buffers: High Stringency Buffer (15 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7, 5 mM EDTA pH 8, 2.5 mM EGTA pH 8, 1% Triton-X100, 1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 120 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl), High Salt Buffer (15 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7, 5 mM EDTA pH 8, 2.5 mM EGTA pH 8, 1% Triton-X100, 1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 1M NaCl) and NT2 Buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.0005% NP-40).

FH-WDR5 complexes were then captured by adding 10 \u03bcl HA-agarose slurry (Pierce) to each sample for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C on rotation. The samples were then washed as previously done on the FLAG-M2 beads. After washing each sample was resuspended in 100 \u03bcl of ProteinaseK Buffer (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.5% SDS) and 5 \u03bcl of ProteinaseK (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA) for 45 min at 50\u00b0C in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) at 1000 rpm. After ProteinaseK treatment 500 \u03bcl of Trizol LS (Qiagen, Venlo, Limburg) was added to each sample, vortexed for 10 s, and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 5 min. Total RNA was recovered from each sample with the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Limburg) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, treated with TURBO-DNAfree (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA), and repurified with the miRNeasy kit. The Ovation v2 Kit (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA) was used according to the manufactures instructions to produce dsDNA from the purified RNA enriched by the RIPiT. DNA isolated from the Ovation v2 Kit was then used in the NEBNext ChIP-Seq Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina Kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA) following the manufactures instructions to produce barcoded deep sequencing libraries.

A gene was defined enriched in wide-type WDR5 pull down if the minimum enrichment score of this gene in both wide-type replicates is greater than 0 and greater than the maximum of that in empty vector and mutated samples. There were 1434 enriched genes, whose enriched score were clustered using Cluster and plotted in Treeview. WDR5 ChIPseq peaks were downloaded from <a href=\"#bib1\">Ang et al. (2011)</a>, and genes whose promoter region (2 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream of its TSS) overlaps with any WDR5 ChIPseq peak were defined as WDR5 bounded genes. Overlay of WDR5 bounded genes with WDR5 RIPseq enriched genes was shown and p value of the significance was estimated using Fisher\u2019s Exact test.

We tested UV-crosslinking with PAR- CLIP, but found that WDR5-RNA interactions have poor inherent UV crosslinking ability. We also found that standard RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) with FLAG epitope gave substantial background that hampered data interpretation. We then turned to RNA:protein immunoprecipitation in tandem (RIPiT), a method designed to identify RNA targets of RBP complexes with poor UV linking capacity (Singh et al., Methods, 2013). Specifically, we fused tandem FLAG and hemagglutinin (HA) tags to wild type WDR5 or the F266A mutant, and generated stable ESC lines expressing either fusion protein at near endogenous levels (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>). FPLC analysis confirmed that both tandem-tagged WDR5 proteins quantitatively formed equivalent MLL-WDR5 protein complexes with endogenous subunits (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>)."

We identified over 1400 RNAs that bound WDR5, but importantly not to F266A mutant or vector control (revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>). Thus, a family of ESC RNAs bind WDR5 through the same surface as HOTTIP and NeST, enhancer-like RNAs that act in other cell types. WDR5 binds many types of RNAs including messenger RNAs, lncRNAs, and precursors of small regulatory RNAs, dramatically expanding the known RNA targets of this protein. Importantly, six lncRNA partners of WDR5 are known to be important for ESC pluripotency or differentiation based on published knockdown experiments (revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Intriguingly, prior protein interaction surveys with repressive chromatin modification complexes had failed to identify protein partners for these lncRNAs (Guttman et al., Nature, 2011), and their interaction with WDR5-MLL, a complex that enforces active chromatin, provides an explanation for their functions in ESC biology. The four lncRNAs identified by Sheik Mohamed et al. were not enriched in WDR5 RIPiT-seq."

The chromatin binding profiles of WDR5 at cis-RNA bound loci vs RNA-independent loci are indistinguishable as a class, highlighting the value of the RIPiT data set to reveal RNA involvement (revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Collectively, the discovery of a family of ESC RNAs that bind WDR5 specifically through a RNA binding pocket will serve as a valuable resource for the field. The defect of the F266A mutant in binding specific lncRNAs required for ESC pluripotency provides a direct mechanistic links to its phenotypes in defective ESC self renewal and ectopic differentiation."

Prior protein interaction surveys with repressive chromatin modification complexes had failed to identify partners for these lncRNAs (Guttman et al., Nature, 2011), and their interaction with WDR5-MLL, a complex that enforces active chromatin, provides an explanation for their functions in ESC biology. As an example, linc-1552 is a WDR5-interacting lncRNA that acts in a positive feedback circuit for pluripotency. Oct4 and Nanog bind linc-1552 promoter, and depletion of linc-1552 leads to loss of Nanog and Oct4 expression. This mechanism parallels the one described by Lipovich and colleagues (Sheik Mohamaed et al., RNA, 2010) for four lncRNAs they identified to be important for ESC stemness."

The lncRNA field has focused on understanding the function of one lncRNA at a time, and we believe that a strength of our work is the elucidation of the cumulative effects of entire classes of lncRNAs. Using the above example where each PRC2-interacting lncRNA regulates a well-defined set of targets, the entire class of PRC2-interacting lncRNAs likely controls thousands of genes, either positively or negatively (Davidovich et al. and Kaneko et al., NSMB, 2013, cited in text). In this paper, we have elucidated the cumulative effects of the entire class of WDR5-binding RNAs in ES cells by replacing WDR5 WT with a RNA binding-null mutant, and we found that this single perturbation to WDR5-MLL complex results in global changes in H3K4me3 and cell fate, highlighting the importance of RNA input into WDR5."
