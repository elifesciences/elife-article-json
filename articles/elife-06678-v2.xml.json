For simple unimodal stimuli, previous studies have shown that human subjects set their speed/accuracy trade-off to maximize reward rate. We extend this analysis to situations in which information is provided by multiple sensory modalities. Analyzing previously collected data (<a href=\"#bib4\">Drugowitsch et al., 2014</a>), we show that human subjects adjust their speed/accuracy trade-off to produce near-optimal reward rates. This trade-off can change rapidly across trials according to the sensory modalities involved, suggesting that it is represented by neural population codes rather than implemented by slow neuronal mechanisms such as gradual changes in synaptic weights. Furthermore, we show that deviations from the optimal speed/accuracy trade-off can be explained by assuming an incomplete gradient-based learning of these trade-offs."

For simple unimodal stimuli, previous studies have shown that human subjects set their speed/accuracy trade-off to maximize reward rate. We extend this analysis to situations in which information is provided by multiple sensory modalities. Analyzing previously collected data (<a href=\"#bib4\">Drugowitsch et al., 2014</a>), we show that human subjects adjust their speed/accuracy trade-off to produce near-optimal reward rates. This trade-off can change rapidly across trials according to the sensory modalities involved, suggesting that it is represented by neural population codes rather than implemented by slow neuronal mechanisms such as gradual changes in synaptic weights. Furthermore, we show that deviations from the optimal speed/accuracy trade-off can be explained by assuming an incomplete gradient-based learning of these trade-offs."

One can make fast, but uninformed and thus inaccurate, decisions or one can elect to make slower, but well-informed, choices. Choosing this so-called speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) becomes even more complex if several sensory modalities provide decision-related information. For example, the strategy for crossing a busy street will be very different in bright daylight, when one can rely on both eyes and ears to detect oncoming vehicles, as compared to complete darkness, in which case the ears will prove to be the more reliable source of information."

For the most commonly studied visual modality, it has been shown that animals accumulate evidence near-optimally over time (<a href=\"#bib10\">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</a>). In this context, the efficiency of the chosen SAT is assessed in comparison to <i>diffusion models</i>, a family of models that trigger decisions as soon as a drifting and diffusing particle reaches one of two bounds (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ratcliff, 1978</a>). In these models, which describe the SAT surprisingly well despite their simplicity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ratcliff, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Palmer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>), the drift represents the available sensory information, and the diffusion causes variability in decision times and choices. The level of the bound controls the SAT, with a higher bound leading to slower, more accurate choices. Instructed changes to the SAT have been shown to be well captured by changes to only the bound in a diffusion model (<a href=\"#bib17\">Reddi and Carpenter, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Reddi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Palmer et al., 2005</a>). Without being explicitly instructed to make either fast or accurate decisions, well-trained human subjects are known to adjust their SAT to maximize their reward rate (<a href=\"#bib22\">Simen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Balci et al., 2011</a>), or a combination of reward rate and choice accuracy (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bogacz et al., 2010</a>). These SAT adjustments are also well captured by tuning the corresponding diffusion model bounds. Thus, we can define the SAT directly in terms of these bounds: a constant SAT refers to behavior predicted by diffusion models with constant bounds, and a SAT that changes across trials requires a diffusion model with bounds that vary on the same time-scale."

We have previously shown that, even in the case of multiple modalities and time-varying evidence reliability, humans are able to accumulate evidence across time and modalities in a statistically near-optimal fashion (<a href=\"#bib4\">Drugowitsch et al., 2014</a>). This analysis was based on a variant of diffusion models that retains optimal evidence accumulation even for multiple sources of evidence whose reliability varies differentially over time. As we focused on evidence accumulation in that study, we were agnostic as to how the SAT varied across stimulus conditions; thus, we left the model bounds, which controlled the SAT, as free parameters that were adjusted to best explain the subjects' behavior."

Specifically, we find that subjects adjust their SAT on a trial by trial basis, depending on whether the stimuli are unisensory or multisensory. Moreover, the changes in SAT result in reward rates that are close to those achievable by the best-tuned model, a finding that is robust to changes in assumptions about how the reward rate is computed. Finally, we demonstrate that small deviations from the optimal SAT seem to stem from an incomplete reward rate maximization process. Overall, our findings hint at decision-making strategies that are more flexible than previously assumed, with SATs that are efficiently changed on a trial-by-trial basis."

Having related changes in the SAT to changes in diffusion model bounds, this is akin to asking if their behavior could arise from a diffusion model with a bound that changes on a trial-by-trial basis. Our diffusion model necessitates the use of a <i>scaled</i> bound, which is the constant <i>actual</i> bound per modality divided by the diffusion standard deviation that depends on optic flow coherence. The use of such a scaled bound prohibits us from fitting actual bound levels, but rather scaled versions thereof. For the same reason, we cannot unambiguously predict the behavior that would emerge from a model with actual bounds matched across modalities (i.e., a constant SAT). Therefore, we instead rely on a qualitative argument about how such matched bounds would be reflected in the relation between decision speed and accuracy across modalities."

This pattern was similar if only the visual modality (solid blue lines, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) or both modalities were present (solid red lines, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This result is qualitatively compatible with the idea that subjects used a single SAT within conditions in which the same modality (visual/vestibular) or modality combination (combined) provided information about heading. Within the framework of diffusion models with fixed actual bounds on the diffusing particle, such a single SAT predicts that, once the amount of evidence per unit time (in our case controlled by the coherence) increases, choices ought to be on average either faster, more accurate, or both in combination, but never slower or less accurate. However, our data violate this prediction, thus showing that the SAT changes across conditions. Consider, for example, the choice accuracy and reaction times of subject B2 in both the visual-only (top blue circle, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and combined condition (top red square, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) trials at 70% motion coherence. Although the combined condition provides more evidence per unit time due to the additional presence of the vestibular modality, responses in the combined condition are less accurate than in the visual-only condition, violating the idea of a single SAT (that is, a fixed diffusion model bound) across conditions. The same pattern emerged across all subjects, whose choices in the combined condition were on average significantly less accurate than in the visual condition (for 70% coherence; one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank <i>W</i> = 54, p &lt; 0.002). As these stimulus conditions were interleaved across trials, our results clearly indicate that subjects were able to change their SAT on a trial-by-trial basis."

Therefore, we computed reward rate as the fraction of correct decisions across all trials, divided by the average time between the onset of consecutive trials. We proceed in two steps: first, we ask whether subjects have a higher reward rate across trials of the multisensory condition compared to both unimodal conditions. This is an important question because we have found previously that subjects accumulate evidence optimally across modalities (<a href=\"#bib4\">Drugowitsch et al., 2014</a>), which implies that, with proper setting of the SAT, they should be able to obtain higher reward rates in the multisensory condition compared to the unimodal conditions. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, reward rate is indeed greater, for all subjects, when both sensory modalities are presented than for either modality alone (both unimodal vs combined: Wilcoxon signed-ranks <i>W</i> = 0, p &lt; 0.002).

For this purpose, we focus on the reward rate across all trials rather than for specific stimulus conditions, as subjects might, for example, trade off decision accuracy in unimodal conditions with decision speed in the combined condition. To determine how close subjects were to maximizing their reward rate, we needed to compute the best achievable reward rate. To do this, we tuned the bounds of our modified diffusion model to maximize its reward rate, while keeping all other model parameters, including the non-decision times and choice biases, fixed to those resulting from fits to the behavior of individual subjects. As a starting point, we allowed bounds to vary freely for each stimulus modality and each motion coherence, to provide the greatest degrees of freedom for the maximization. As described further below, we also performed the same analysis with more restrictive assumptions. We call the reward rate resulting from this procedure the <i>optimal</i> reward rate.

Thus far, we have assumed implicit, constant rewards for correct decisions and the absence of any losses for the passage of time or incorrect choices. However, accumulating evidence is effortful, and this effort might offset the eventual gains resulting from correct choices. In fact, previous work suggests that human decision makers incur such a cost, possibly related to mental effort, in the range of 0.1\u20130.2 units of reward per second for accumulating evidence (<a href=\"#bib5\">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</a>). Importantly, this cost modulates both the subjects' and the optimal reward rate, causing the median reward rate across subjects to actually rise slightly to 95.4% and 95.1% (costs of 0.1 and 0.2) of the optimum value (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, second and third columns), compared to the cost-free median of 93.7%."

Using instead the more realistic assumption (<a href=\"#bib4\">Drugowitsch et al., 2014</a>) that bounds only vary across modalities while coherence modulates diffusion variance but not bound height, we reduce the number of parameters and thus degrees of freedom for reward rate maximization. As a result, subjects' reward rates relative to the optimum rise slightly (median 94.5%), where the optimal model is now restricted to use the same bound across all coherences (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, fourth column). Furthermore, we have assumed the model to feature the same choice biases as the subjects. These biases reduce the probability of performing correct choices, and thus the reward rate, such that removing them from our model boosts the model's optimal reward rate. As a consequence, removing these biases causes a consistent drop in subjects' relative reward rate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, last two columns). Even then, reward rates are still around 90% of the optimum (median 87.8% and 88.7% for free and parametric bounds, respectively).

Nevertheless, subjects' speed/accuracy trade-off remained rather stable after removing feedback, which includes all trials we analyzed. Thus, incomplete learning in the initial training period should be reflected equally in all of these trials. To test the incomplete-learning hypothesis, we assumed that subjects adjusted their strategy in small steps by using gradient-based information about how the reward rate changed in the local neighborhood of the currently chosen bounds. For our argument, it does not matter if the gradient-based strategy was realized through stochastic trial-and-error or more refined approaches involving analytic estimates of the gradient, as long as it involved an unbiased estimate of the gradient. What is important, however, is that such an approach would lead to faster learning along directions of steeper gradients (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

Specifically, reward rate curvature is generally moderate to strong in the vestibular-only and combined conditions, and most of these bounds are found to be near-optimal. In contrast, curvature is rather low for the visual condition, and many of the associated bounds are far from their optimal settings. This is exactly the pattern one would expect to observe if deviations from optimality result from a prematurely terminated gradient-based learning strategy. This analysis rests on the assumption that the manner in which reward rate varies with changes in the bounds is well approximated by a quadratic function. If this were the case, then the estimated loss in reward rate featured by the subjects when compared to the tuned model should also be well approximated by this quadratic function.

With such uncertainty, subjects should set their bound above that deemed to be optimal when the inter-trial interval is perfectly known. A similar above-optimal bound would arise if subjects are either uncertain about the optimal bound, or have difficulty in maintaining their bounds at the same level across trials. This is because the reward rate drops off more quickly below than above the optimal bounds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Thus, if the subject's bounds fluctuate across trials, or the subjects are uncertain about the optimal bounds, they should aim at setting their bounds above rather than below this optimum. Indeed, this would minimize the probability that the bound would fluctuate well below the optimal value, which would result in a very sharp drop in reward rate. However, our data indicate that, in contrast to previous findings from single-modality tasks (<a href=\"#bib22\">Simen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bogacz et al., 2010</a>), subjects consistently set their bounds below the optimum level (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

While not always as extreme as shown for this subject, a distinct discrepancy between observed and reward rate-maximizing behavior exists for all subjects, and is a reflection of the fact that near-optimal reward rates can be achieved with remarkably different joint tunings of reaction times and choice accuracy."

A more likely alternative, that is compatible with neurophysiological findings, is a neuronal \u2018urgency signal\u2019 that modulates this trade-off by how quickly it drives decision-related neuronal activity to a common decision threshold (<a href=\"#bib7\">Hanks et al., 2014</a>). Although only observed for blocked designs, a similar modality-dependent urgency signal could account for the trial-by-trial SAT changes of our experiment, and qualitatively mimic a change in diffusion model bounds. Currently, our model can only predict changes in scaled decision boundaries, which conflate actual boundary levels with the diffusion standard deviation. It does not predict how the actual bound level changes, which is the quantity that relates to the magnitude of such an urgency signal. In general, quantitatively relating diffusion model parameters to neural activity strongly depends on how specific neural populations encode accumulated evidence, which has only been investigated for cases that are substantially simpler (e.g., <a href=\"#bib11\">Kira et al., 2015</a>) than the ones we consider here."

Even though the different deadline conditions were blocked, analysis of FEF neural activity revealed a change in baseline activity that emerged already in the first trial of each consecutive block, hinting at flexible mechanisms that pre-emptively govern changes in SAT. In general, such changes in SAT are likely to emerge through orchestrated changes in multiple neural mechanisms, such as changes in baseline, visual gain, duration of perceptual processing, and the other effects observed by <a href=\"#bib8\">Heitz and Schall (2012)</a>, or through combined changes to perceptual processing and motor preparation, as suggested by <a href=\"#bib19\">Salinas et al.

The clearest example of a strategy that is not gradient-based is one that does not at all adjust the SAT, or one that does so randomly, without regard to the error feedback that was given to subjects during the initial training period. Such strategies are not guaranteed to lead to the consistent curvature/bound distance relationship observed in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>. For a single speed/accuracy trade-off, adjusting this trade-off has already been thoroughly investigated, albeit with conflicting results (<a href=\"#bib12\">Myung and Busemeyer, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Simen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Simen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Balci et al., 2011</a>).

This near-optimal performance is invariant under various assumptions about how the reward rate is computed, and is, even under the most conservative assumptions, in the range of 90% of the optimal reward rate. Deviations from optimality are unlikely to have emerged from a strategy of setting bounds to make them robust to perturbations. Instead, our data support the idea that decision bounds have been tuned by a gradient-based strategy. Such tuning is also in line with the observation of near-optimal reward rates, which are unlikely to result from a random bound-setting strategy. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the flexibility with which human decision makers choose between speed and accuracy of their choices."

The projected colors (filled cirles in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> plot) closely match the original ones (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> legend), which reveals that the curvature eigenspace is well aligned to that of the bound parameters.

What the authors found was: (1) that the subjects' behavior across experimental conditions (difficulty x modality) was indeed consistent with reward-rate maximization, and (2) that the observed deviations from optimality were small and can be explained as the consequence of incomplete or imperfect learning.\u201d"

It is fine to show that, but the question is whether the SAT is tuned, not whether it exists at all. The relevant comparison is the condition in which the bound is not zero but just constant across conditions; i.e., when the SAT setting is simply fixed. The key piece of information is, how large is the discrepancy between the maximum reward rate obtainable with a variable SAT (i.e., adjustable bound) and one obtainable with a constant SAT (non-adjustable bound)?"

Deviations from the optimal bound settings in directions of strong curvature cause larger drops in the reward rate than deviations of similar magnitude in directions of weak curvature (illustrated below by a different spread of iso-reward rate contours in different directions). Thus, if subjects feature close-to-optimal reward rates, one would expect the bounds to be close-to-optimal in directions of strong curvature. However, this might not be the case in directions of weak curvature, as bound mis-tunings in these directions do not strongly impact the reward rate. In other words, one would expect the bounds to be further from optimal in directions of weak curvature, as illustrated in the top panel in <a href=\"#fig5\">Author response image 1</a> (assuming two-dimensional bounds, one dot per subject), just to achieve the observed reward rate. However, this result is not as obvious as it may appear. We could equally well take all these dots and move them along the ellipsoidal iso-reward curves (along which the reward rate does not change) until they are aligned along directions of strong curvature (bottom panel in below figure). Thus, for the same close-to-optimal reward rates we could have observed the opposite pattern\u2014closer- to-optimal bounds in directions of weak curvature rather than directions of strong curvature\u2014but we didn\u2019t.
