We have measured with 3-min time resolution how heritable patterns of chromatin structure are initially established and maintained during the midblastula transition (MBT). We find that regions of accessibility are established sequentially, where enhancers are opened in advance of promoters and insulators. These open states are stably maintained in highly condensed mitotic chromatin to ensure faithful inheritance of prior accessibility status across cell divisions. The temporal progression of establishment is controlled by the biological timers that control the onset of the MBT. In general, acquisition of promoter accessibility is controlled by the biological timer that measures the nucleo-cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio, whereas timing of enhancer accessibility is regulated independently of the N:C ratio. These different timing classes each associate with binding sites for two transcription factors, GAGA-factor and Zelda, previously implicated in controlling chromatin accessibility at ZGA."

We have measured with 3-min time resolution how heritable patterns of chromatin structure are initially established and maintained during the midblastula transition (MBT). We find that regions of accessibility are established sequentially, where enhancers are opened in advance of promoters and insulators. These open states are stably maintained in highly condensed mitotic chromatin to ensure faithful inheritance of prior accessibility status across cell divisions. The temporal progression of establishment is controlled by the biological timers that control the onset of the MBT. In general, acquisition of promoter accessibility is controlled by the biological timer that measures the nucleo-cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio, whereas timing of enhancer accessibility is regulated independently of the N:C ratio. These different timing classes each associate with binding sites for two transcription factors, GAGA-factor and Zelda, previously implicated in controlling chromatin accessibility at ZGA."

Similarly, mitosis is characterized by highly condensed chromatin structure, and it remains unclear the degree to which prior accessibility states are maintained under these conditions. Notably, despite this highly condensed state, it is possible that the underlying structure retains the overall organization and accessibility state of interphase nuclei (<a href=\"#bib17\">Earnshaw and Laemmli, 1983</a>). Indeed, a recent study of chromatin structure in murine erythroblasts revealed that the patterns of DNase hypersensitivity are largely preserved during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hsiung et al., 2015</a>). We wanted to assess when such features of chromatin structure are acquired during early embryogenesis."

Classical methodologies for measuring chromatin accessibility (e.g., DNase hypersensitivity) and nucleosome positioning (e.g., Micrococcal nuclease digestion) typically require large quantities of input chromatin, on the order of 10<sup>3</sup>\u201310<sup>5</sup> embryos. Such a high requirement for input material significantly limits the temporal resolution of these experiments, requiring embryos to be pooled from collections spanning hours. Yet, changes in early embryonic chromatin structure are predicted to occur over minute timescales (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015b</a>). A recently\u00a0developed approach, ATAC-seq (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buenrostro et al., 2013</a>), overcomes many of these limitations, allowing for sensitive measurement of both chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning in samples as small as single cells."

Fragmentation preferentially occurs at open, nucleosome-free regions. Accessible regions of the genome are recovered as small (50\u2013100 bp) fragments. In addition, because nucleosome occupancy is refractory to fragmentation, a second population of larger protected fragments is also recovered, and these are used to predict nucleosome positions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buenrostro et al., 2013</a>). In practice, nucleosome positioning is best estimated by coverage of large protected fragments that are flanked by small accessible fragments (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schep et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, the organization of generally \u2018open\u2019 chromatin, composed of a mixture of short tracts of accessible DNA with interspersed nucleosomes is effectively measured by this technique."

Despite this intense cell cycle activity, embryos arrive at the MBT having established the initial chromatin state upon which developmental patterning systems will initially operate (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Harrison and Eisen, 2015</a>). It is unclear whether such regions are established anew during each cell cycle, or instead whether establishment entails the acquisition of mechanisms to counteract the otherwise deleterious consequences of mitosis and DNA replication.

Within a total set of 9824 accessible peaks, two general temporal classes emerge from this analysis that reflect the timing of the initial acquisition of accessibility: peaks that are accessible early and that persist throughout the entire period of observation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, middle panel, and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> \u2018Open by NC11\u2019, n\u00a0=\u00a03084 (31%)), and peaks that gain accessibility during this period (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>: right panel; and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>: New at NC12 or NC13, n\u00a0=\u00a06740 (69%)). These peaks were assigned to genomic features based on existing annotations (promoters, insulators, and enhancers; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and Materials and methods). During this period, 78% (3027 of 3887) of all promoters and insulators dynamically gain accessibility during NC12 and NC13, whereas 47% (1538 of 3260) of all enhancers are open early, already by NC11. We also detect accessibility at 717 peaks overlapping with 854 experimentally\u00a0validated enhancers from the Vienna Fly Enhancers collection (19.9% of all enhancers in the collection, n\u00a0=\u00a03604) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kvon et al., 2014</a>). This subset of enhancers is similarly enriched for sites that gain accessibility by NC11 (41%, 294 of 717: p=1.1x10<sup>\u22127</sup> by Fisher\u2019s Exact Test for \u00b1 NC11 by \u00b1 Fly Enhancer). These results suggest that, on average, enhancer accessibility precedes that of promoters. This effect is evident on both short and long timescales. Over short timescales on the order of minutes, we observe stable enhancer accessibility precedes that of associated promoters (e.g. <i>hunchback P1</i>, <i>tribbles</i>, <i>empty spiracles, Ultrabithorax, sloppy paired 2, forkhead</i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s8\">8</a>). This observation is consistent with a model where promoter accessibility is limiting for activation of expression of these genes in spatially\u00a0restricted patterns, and that enhancer elements could be \u2018primed\u2019 independently of these promoters in advance of expression. In support of this, we also observe that within the set of Vienna Fly Enhancers overlapping our set of accessible peaks, although 386 (45.2%) of these enhancers drive active gene expression in early embryos (stage 4\u20136), 468 of these enhancers (54.8%) are not transcriptionally active until hours later in development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Notably, compared with peaks that open early (NC11), the set of peaks that open late (NC12-13) are enriched for enhancers that will be active later in development (&gt;stage 4\u20136: n\u00a0=\u00a0158 for NC11 and 310 for NC12 and 13: p=1.13x10<sup>\u22127</sup> by Fisher\u2019s Exact Test for \u00b1 NC11 by \u00b1 stage 4\u20136 expression)."

A random sample of 100,000 reads for each timepoint was selected and the distribution of read lengths was plotted as shown above. The x-axis indicates the length in base-pairs of the mapped read and the y-axis indicates the number of reads of x base-pairs within the sample. In each plot, the leftmost peak corresponds to \u2018open\u2019 chromatin fragments, and the adjacent peak distribution corresponds to fragments protected by nucleosomes (or nucleosome-sized objects). The boxplots at right show the distribution of estimated input DNA concentration (left plot) and the distribution of uniquely mapping sequence reads (right plot) for interphase (n\u00a0=\u00a030) and metaphase (n\u00a0=\u00a010) staged samples. The p-value at the top of each plot was calculated by randomly assigning samples to similarly sized groups (n\u00a0=\u00a030 and 10) and calculating the difference between the average value in each group. The p-value indicates the frequency with which the difference between metaphase and interphase samples is greater than the difference between randomly selected samples (n\u00a0=\u00a01\u00d710<sup>5</sup> permutations)."

Likewise, we find that promoters for genes required to pattern the dorsal-ventral axis (<i>decapentaplegic, zerknullt, short gastrulation</i>, <i>brinker</i>, <i>snail</i>, and <i>twist,</i> data not shown) are scored open by NC11. Later acting embryonic patterning genes, such as the segment polarity genes, demonstrate variable timing for acquisition of chromatin accessibility, with the <i>wingless</i> promoter opening by NC11, but those of <i>engrailed</i> and <i>patched</i> open at NC12, and the <i>hedgehog</i> promoter becomes open by NC13 (<a href=\"#fig1s22\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 22</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s25\">25</a>).

Loci that are open early are enriched for binding of Zelda, whereas dynamic loci are enriched for binding of GAF (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). These results suggest that the initial establishment of open chromatin proceeds in a stepwise or sequential manner where accessibility of genomic cis-regulatory elements precedes that of promoter and insulator elements. The coordinated change in promoter accessibility that occurs during NC12 and NC13 coincides with the large-scale recruitment of RNA Pol II to thousands of genes at ZGA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015b</a>). These observations further support a model where the gain of promoter accessibility is the limiting factor for large-scale ZGA."

If this were the case, then we would expect that delaying the onset of the MBT would lead to corresponding delays in acquisition of chromatin accessibility. To distinguish the relative contribution of each timer to establishment of chromatin accessibility, we performed an ATAC-seq timecourse on pairs of N:C ratio-matched haploid embryos maternally mutant for the <i>sesame</i> locus (<i>ssm</i>, flybase: <i>Hira</i>, see also Materials and methods) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Loppin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bonnefoy et al., 2007</a>).

Therefore, we predicted that any N:C ratio-dependent chromatin remodeling would be delayed in haploid compared with diploid embryos (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lu et al., 2009</a>), whereas the timing of N:C ratio independent events would remain unchanged."

At equivalent developmental times, only 34.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.1% of dynamic peaks are accessible in haploids compared with diploids. In contrast, at equivalent N:C ratios, 84.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.8% of dynamic peaks are accessible in haploids versus diploids (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, n\u00a0=\u00a04288 scored peaks). Based on this analysis, we classified each scored peak as N:C ratio- or time-dependent (n\u00a0=\u00a02630 and 1658, respectively). In diploid embryos, changes in accessibility occur with similar dynamics in both time- and N:C-ratio-dependent loci. In haploids, time-dependent loci gain accessibility in advance of N:C-ratio-dependent loci (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), which in turn only become accessible upon attaining the correct N:C ratio (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Importantly, classification into these different timing classes recapitulates the early versus late/dynamic dichotomy we observe between different genomic regulatory features (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Time-dependent loci are significantly enriched for enhancers and Zelda-associated regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), similarly to the set of early accessible domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In contrast, N:C-ratio-dependent loci are significantly enriched for both promoter, insulator and GAF-associated regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), similarly to the set of late or dynamic regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). These results indicate that, similar to large-scale ZGA and cell cycle remodeling, the acquisition of chromatin accessibility at the MBT is likewise sensitive to the embryonic N:C ratio. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model where the biological timers that determine the MBT operate via distinct sets of chromatin regulatory factors such as Zelda and GAF in order to impart the sequential establishment of chromatin structure in advance of ZGA."

For example, during each cycle, the <i>hb</i> P2 promoter/enhancer displays minimum accessibility 3 min after entering interphase and subsequently reaches maximum accessibility during mitotic prophase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, red trace). The observed increase in overall accessibility during interphase positively correlates with the transcriptional activity of this locus, as measured by an MS2::MCP reporter (<a href=\"#bib22\">Garcia et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, blue trace). However, at mitotic metaphase, although transcriptional activity ceases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and RNA Polymerase II is largely evicted from chromatin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), chromatin accessibility is nonetheless maintained (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, grey bars).

To measure how nucleosome positioning changes during these early embryonic cell cycles, we mapped nucleosome positions flanking the total set of accessible chromatin regions using NucleoATAC (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schep et al., 2015</a>). One conserved feature of promoter chromatin architecture is a characteristic nucleosome-free region (NFR) upstream of the TSS. Promoters are useful for evaluating nucleosome positioning because, unlike in enhancers, the occupying nucleosomes adopt stereotypical phased positions around the NFR, anchored to a determined point of reference, the TSS, which facilitates the evaluation of dynamic nucleosome behavior at accessible sites following DNA replication."

Such NFR structures are observed at promoters between NC11 and NC13 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). However, significant disruption to this promoter structure is clearly observed during DNA replication, particularly at 3 min into NC11 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>, NC11\u00a0+\u00a03\u2019). Promoters largely recover nucleosome positioning by prophase and metaphase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, NC11\u00a0+\u00a06\u2019 and\u00a0+9\u2019, respectively). Nucleosome organization at promoters undergoes a similar disordering and recovery during NC12. However, the ability of replication to disrupt nucleosome structure is strikingly reduced during NC13, the developmental period when large-scale changes in zygotic transcriptional activity are first observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, NC13\u00a0+\u00a03\u2019 and\u00a0+6\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015b</a>). This effect is also reflected in the times required for prior accessibility levels to be recovered at these regions following replication. On average, NFRs recover prior accessibility levels by 9 min into NC12. Despite the longer overall cell cycle time and incipient changes to the rate of S-phase progression during NC13, recovery of prior accessibility states is achieved on average by 6 min into NC13 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results indicate that over this period there is a shift in the balance between replication-coupled nucleosome disordering and the counteracting regulatory factors that maintain patterns of chromatin accessibility. Initially, post-replicative gains in accessibility, although maintained through mitosis, are erased by DNA replication during the following cell cycle. Stabilization of nucleosome structure during NC13, however, would allow for large-scale recruitment of RNA Pol II to promoters early in the cell cycle. These observations are consistent with previous observations that the temporal regulation of the MBT stems from conflicting interactions between RNA transcription and DNA replication, at the level of the initial establishment of accessible chromatin structure (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015b</a>)."

For each timepoint, the maximum ATAC-seq count value corresponding to open and accessible chromatin was calculated for each NFR (n\u00a0=\u00a02470) and plotted. Chromatin accessibility at NFRs doubles on average over the course of each cell cycle (Left Panel). The boxplots show the calculated log2 fold change between the first and last timepoint in each indicated cell cycle for each NFR. A greater negative log2 fold change in accessbility is observed between metaphase 11 and early interphase 12 than between metaphase 12 and interphase 13 (Middle Panel). The dotted grey line indicates no difference in fold change between compared timepoints. To estimate the latency in recovery of accessibility to prior levels of chromatin accessibility, data for each NFR was subjected to spline interpolation and the timepoint when accessibility in the following cell cycle is equal to or greater than accessibility for the preceding metaphase was calculated. The right panel shows the kernel density estimate for the distribution of latency times for recovery during NC12 and NC13 (black and red traces, respectively). The distribution of latency estimates is biphasic for both cell cycles, with NC12 showing nearly equivalent distribution between early (3 min) and late (9 min) recovering regions. A larger proportion of NFRs recover by 3 min during NC13. Median values for raw, non-interpolated data (inset) are\u00a0+9 min for NC12, and\u00a0+6 min for NC13."

To distinguish these possibilities, we measured changes in NFR size between time- and N:C-ratio-dependent promoters in haploid embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The average NFR size for N:C-ratio-dependent promoters in haploids correlates well with that of diploid embryos when plotted over equivalent N:C ratios (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, blue trace), demonstrating attenuated replication coupled nucleosome disruption during the final cell cycle before the MBT. In contrast, the set of time-dependent promoters in haploids demonstrate attenuated disruption of NFR size one cell cycle earlier than their N:C ratio dependent counterparts, prior to S-phase remodeling (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, red trace, asterisks). Likewise, in haploid embryos, early, time-dependent Zelda-associated promoters demonstrate increased resistance to replication-associated nucleosome disruption compared with later, N:C-ratio-dependent GAF-associated promoters (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This indicates that resistance to replication-coupled nucleosome disruption occurs independently of S-phase remodeling and is linked to the mechanisms that drive the initial establishment of accessible states."

Such competition is not limited to embryonic tissues but is likely a general mechanism for recovery of accessibility states following replication (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ramachandran and Henikoff, 2016</a>). Our results extend these observations by indicating that such competition may be a major point of regulation for the developmental acquisition of stable patterns of chromatin accessibility. Our results also indicate that stability of nucleosome positioning during mitosis is a major mechanism for epigenetic inheritance of prior chromatin states from one cell cycle to the next. Whether such stability requires an active mechanism for stabilization, as has been proposed in mammalian systems (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blobel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hsiung et al., 2015</a>), remains to be determined. Our model therefore predicts that the initial establishment of stable accessible chromatin states during periods of intense mitotic activity is limited by the availability of transcription factors. Upon reaching a critical activity threshold, regulatory factors such as Zelda and GAF would successfully compete with nucleosomes to efficiently re-establish patterns of chromatin accessibility following DNA replication. This competition model is consistent with a prior observation that reduction of function for either GAF or Zelda is sufficient to reduce conflicts between the DNA replication machinery and some feature of chromatin remodeling at ZGA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015b</a>). Such competitive interactions between systems for transcription and replication may also be conserved timing mechanisms in vertebrate embryos (<a href=\"#bib2\">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Amodeo et al., 2015</a>)."

Individual embryos were selected from plates and arrayed in individual wells in Nunc Microwell Mini Trays (VWR,\u00a0Radnor,\u00a0PA), and nuclear morphology was observed by Histone-GFP fluorescence under an AMG EVOS FL digital microscope at 20x magnification. Temperatures for sample collection were maintained between 21\u00b0C and 24\u00b0C to minimize variation in cell cycle timing (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Under these conditions, cell cycle times were indistinguishable from those measured by confocal microscopy and reported in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015b</a>). Developmental stage was determined as follows: NC12\u00a0=\u00a012 to 18 nuclei per 2500 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>; NC13\u00a0=\u00a022\u201330 nuclei per 2500 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>; and NC14 =\u00a0&gt;\u00a030 nuclei per 2500 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>. Cell cycles were timed from the onset of anaphase of the previous cell cycle. The staging of samples at 3-min intervals relies on the synchrony of nuclear divisions and the extraordinary reproducibility in the timing and duration of cell cycles in the cleavage stage Drosophila embryos. Each embryo was hand-selected for analysis at metaphase of the preceding cycle. To ensure synchrony, only embryos in which all nuclei had entered metaphase within a 30 s window were selected. Anaphase was then required to have begun across the length of the embryo within a 60 s window and the total elapsed time for mitosis (metaphase start to anaphase start) was not allowed to exceed 3 min. Embryos exceeding these limits (\u00a0~10%) were discarded. Under these conditions, embryos selected at cycle 10 anaphase reach metaphase of cycle 11 in 8.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 min \u00b1 s.d., embryos selected at cycle 11 anaphase reach metaphase of cycle 12 in 10.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 min \u00b1 s.d., embryos selected at cycle 12 anaphase reach metaphase 13 in 17.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 min \u00b1 s.d. This precision allows us to select and process embryos for each metaphase stage by selecting at the previous anaphase. Consistent with the reproducible progression of the Drosophila cell cycles, embryos processed at metaphase and timed from the previous cycle interval cluster with each other and single metaphase embryos selected in the previous cell cycle show highly similar and correlated patterns of accessibility (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

As discussed in the introduction, the estimate of accessibility and nucleosome positioning by ATAC seq is sensitive to chromatin topology, where these features can be measured reliably in generally \u2018open\u2019 chromatin, but that the expected reduced recovery of small accessible fragments in generally \u2018closed\u2019 chromatin could limit the resolution of the data. Given that mitotic chromatin, in particular, is superficially expected to have a compact and largely inaccessible structure, we paid close attention to the relative recovery of small and large sequencing fragments for these stages. We observe that indeed, a greater proportion of large, nucleosome-protected fragments are recovered in both metaphase and early interphase (+3 min) samples (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The reason for this distribution could be biological in nature: a greater proportion of the genome may be stably associated with nucleosomes during metaphase and early interphase compared with later times. However, we were careful to consider that this distribution could instead reflect an artifact. In principle, during periods of intense chromatin compaction, a significantly smaller proportion of genomic DNA could perhaps be fragmented by Tn5, but since libraries are PCR-amplified to similar final concentrations, then relatively fewer unique \u2018open\u2019 regions would be recovered than expected. We predicted that if such an artifact were present, that we would have less fragmented DNA in samples originating from metaphase stages. However, as discussed above, the abundance of mitochondrial DNA effectively buffers samples from wide variation in input DNA content. In this case, we would nonetheless expect to observe fewer overall unique recovered sequence reads that map to genomic DNA, if a significant artifact was present in the metaphase samples. To address this possibility, we plotted the inferred quantity of initial fragmented DNA from our individual library preps, and the number of unique sequence reads recovered for each library (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Although there is a trend for metaphase samples on average to have less starting fragmented DNA content and fewer uniquely mapping reads, the magnitude of the difference is small, and indistinguishable from a random permutation of samples. We were therefore confident that open regions recovered from metaphase samples do in fact reflect regions of chromatin accessibility and are minimally influenced from major factors pertaining to sample preparation."

We expected that these additional phenotypes would confound the temporal comparison between diploid and haploid embryos. <i>sesame</i> mutants, in contrast, develop with nearly indistinguishable cell cycle rates and overall fidelity of nuclear division compared with wild-type embryos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, and data not shown). The product of the <i>sesame</i> locus, Hira, is a histone chaperone responsible for the DNA replication independent deposition of the histone variant H3.3 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ray-Gallet et al., 2002</a>). H3.3 is typically deposited in regions of open, transcriptionally active chromatin. Notably, the primary essential function of Hira in early embryos is to facilitate male pronuclear decondensation: H3.3 deposition is grossly unaffected in <i>sesame</i> mutant embryos, indicating a Hira-independent mechanism for H3.3 deposition in early embryos (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bonnefoy et al., 2007</a>). On the basis of these observations, we expected that differences observed between wild-type and <i>sesame</i> mutant embryos would primarily reflect alterations in embryonic DNA content, and would be minimally confounded by H3.3-dependent effects on chromatin accessibility. At present, however, we are unable to rule out any H3.3-independent effects of Hira on the acquisition of chromatin accessibility in our experimental results."

NFRs were calculated by finding the predicted NucleoATAC dyad centers immediately upstream (\u22121) and downstream (\u00a0+1) of the position 25 bp upstream of the TSS. We found that using the \u221225 position for calculation of the \u22121 and\u00a0+1 nucleosomes was necessary because the\u00a0+1 nucleosome can at certain timepoints occlude the TSS, and in these circumstances using the TSS as the vantage point for NFR identification will mistakenly identify the\u00a0+1 and+2 nucleosome. For certain highly\u00a0expressed genes (e.g., <i>slam, bnk, sry-alpha</i>) a\u00a0+1 nucleosome was not called by NucleoATAC. For approximately 33% of all promoters, either the \u22121 or\u00a0+1 nucleosome was not called by NucleoATAC. In these cases, the promoter was omitted from further analysis.

Data were collected by time-lapse laser scanning confocal microscopy of embryos expressing Histone H2Av-RFP and EGFP-PCNA at a 15 s frame rate with a 63\u00d71.4 NA oil immersion objective. Z-stacks were collected to cover the entire span of cortically localized nuclei between NC10 and NC14 at 0.5 \u03bcm intervals. Images were maximum-projected for analysis with Matlab (2014A). PCNA tracks along with DNA Polymerase during replication and the GFP-fusions appear as bright, heterogeneously-distributed foci within S-phase nuclei (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib40\">McCleland et al., 2009</a>). To estimate the overall timing of S-phase between NC11 and NC13, we quantified the degree of PCNA heterogeneity over time. Nuclei were segmented on the Histone RFP channel, and heterogeneity in EGFP-PCNA signal was measured using a grayscale correlation matrix (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). EGFP-PCNA signal was down-sampled to six grayscale levels and correlation matrices were calculated for radial sets of eight pixels separated by 200 nm distance, using the Matlab function graycomatrix.m. For each frame, heterogeneity was calculated as 1 \u2013 \u2018Homogeneity\u2019, as reported by graycomatrix.m. This yields a value between 0 and 1 where 0 indicates that all pixels neighbor pixels of similar intensities, and one indicates that all pixels neighbor pixels of different intensities. The by-frame heterogeneity measurements were next scaled to the mean EGFP-PCNA fluorescence intensity to yield an estimate of the fraction of PCNA associated with heterogeneously distributed fluorescence intensity. We note that similar results have been reported using a different quantification approach that measures the overall coefficient of variation in nuclear PCNA fluorescence intensity rather than grayscale correlation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Deneke et al., 2016</a>)."

The authors used ATAC-seq to probe the chromatin structure of individual pre-blastoderm <i>Drosophila</i> embryos during the final three cleavage divisions leading up to the mid-blastula transition (MBT), a fundamental transition for developing embryos that is of wide general interest. Major chromatin changes leading up to MBT are expected from previous work in <i>Drosophila</i> documenting cytological heterochromatin formation during this period. Employing staged individual embryos allows an exceptionally high and unprecedented level of temporal and cell cycle resolution. Consequently, the study is able to address widely interesting and important issues, including how chromatin accessibility changes during gene activation, and how chromatin is affected by rapid DNA replication and short cell cycle times. While the results are mostly descriptive, they strongly support particular mechanisms and provide a new, higher-level framework for all future studies of this period of embryonic development. Overall, the work represents an important step forward in our understanding of chromatin changes in the early embryo, and it will have a big influence on the field."

An important part of the study concerns the grouping of open region peaks into functional categories: promoters, enhancers, insulators, etc. The accuracy and biological meaning of these groupings is not currently presented in a critical or convincing manner. First, enhancers and insulators were identified using ChIP-seq data from much older embryos. What is the relevance of 0-12hr embryo data to NC11-NC13? The definitions used for insulators and enhancers in terms of protein binding and/or chromatin modifications seemed questionable and were not discussed or justified. The authors should prepare a (smaller) dataset of elements that have been functionally validated during NC11-13 and the next two hours of development and determine if they are consistent with conclusions based on their current dataset. The conclusion that (on average) enhancers become open before promoters, is touted in the Abstract, but its meaning and significance are scarcely discussed. Do such conclusions about opening of promoters and enhancers hold up using groups of specific known genes that become active at different times? When do the enhancers and promoters of gap and pair-rule genes become open, for example? How does the observed landscape of chromatin changes relate to what is known about gene action in early embryos?"

There are three issues here: 1) whether open configurations are maintained through M, 2) whether maintenance is due to an epigenetically based \"transcriptional memory\", and 3) whether maintenance has an actual function- namely to ensure faithful inheritance. The fact open configurations survive M seems clear, since embryos in M phase display no loss of open features. However, is it possible, due to changes in embryonic chromatin during sample preparation, that apparent maintenance might be an artifact of partial progression of some processes into the next cell cycle? Since changing levels of trans acting factors likely cause these chromatin features in the first place, the re-appearance of features after M phase is to be expected whether or not there is any epigenetic \"transcriptional memory.\" None of the data presented by the authors currently presents a convincing case that nucleosome positioning is inherited \"epigenetically\" and beyond that there were no functional tests of the importance of such inheritance. What in this study goes beyond the work of Hsuing and Blobel published this last year? Ramachandran and Henikoff 2016 should be cited and be clear about their own novelty here."

The authors describe how many peaks overlap with binding sites for Zelda or for GAF (not necessarily in NC11-13 embryo cells), and find correlations with N/C dependent or independent classes. While this is consistent with a model in which GAGA factor plays a role in N/C ratio sensing, it is far from proof of such a relationship. It would be useful to see if there is genomic or other data out there on the genes targeted by Zelda and GAF factors in CHIP or knockout studies around the MBT and if the expected genes of the authors are affected."

We have added a section to the Materials and methods (\u201cRead Length Distribution and Estimation of Stage-Specific Library Preparation Bias\u201d) that outlines in detail how we approached the issue of comparing interphase and mitotic chromatin samples. This includes an additional supplemental figure (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) with raw read length distribution data and estimates of initial fragmented DNA concentration and actual unique sequence read distributions from interphase and metaphase staged samples (raw data available in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>).

To clarify, all that is meant by \u2018discarding\u2019 here is that, following preparation of all libraries for a particular genotype, we estimated the starting quantity of fragmented DNA from a single sample by dividing the final library concentration by 2^(number of PCR cycles). The distribution of these values were plotted and outliers (3x the interquartile range) were discarded. The rationale for this is that, when preparing libraries from a single embryo, we were concerned that either some of the nuclear pellet would be lost during the initial sample preparation, or that the sample would be contaminated by exogenous DNA from the environment (e.g., contamination of embryo preps with brewer\u2019s yeast from the embryo collection plates). If any of these were the case, then we would expect to resolve these as extreme outliers less than or greater than the population mean. In practice, these outliers were rare and constituted &lt;5% of all samples prepared for this study.

The supplemental figure demonstrates representative frames from one of the movies that we used in this analysis, and these frames are matched to individual points along a plot of \u201cheterogeneity\u201d (1-Homogeneity) to help the reader interpret the plotted data. McCleland et al., JCB 2009 showed nicely that these patterns of heterogeneous fluorescence intensity are directly linked to DNA replication activity, insofar as blocking DNA origin licensing effectively eliminates the formation of these foci. We also note in the Materials and methods that a recent report has also approached this problem to the same end by quantifying the coefficient of variation in PCNA fluorescence (Deneke et al., Dev.Cell 2016). Follow-up work from the O\u2019Farrell group (Shermoen, et al. Curr.Biol 2010) has demonstrated that replication during NC11 and NC12 does not largely distinguish between early and late replicating domains that are typically ascribed to eu- and hetero-chromatic compartments, but that during NC13 late replicating domains partly begin to emerge. Since we exclusively consider \u201ceuchromatic\u201d portions of the genome in this manuscript, we are confident that our PCNA measurements provide a useful estimate of when DNA replication could be interfering with the underlying organization of chromatin in these regions. The \u2018front-loaded\u2019 aspect of replication in early embryos is a long-standing observation, which is consistent with our observations here. By measuring frequencies of observed \u2018eye-forms\u2019 of replication forks in EM-spreads of blastoderm DNA, Blumenthal et al. 1974 estimated that the interval of time between initiation and completion of replication is approximately 1.25 minutes, and that the vast majority of interphase genomic chromatin is post-replicative. See Figure 5 and text on pages 209-210 in Blumenthal for their argument. This is consistent with a model where DNA replication during the blastoderm cell cycle is highly front-loaded."

From a single vantage point (the TSS) we are calculating the position of the first upstream and first downstream nucleosome, not the overall signal intensity within the maximum limits of the NFR region. This distinction, we think, addresses the heart of the request above. When nucleosome insertion occurs following replication, there is a chance that the insertion will occur within the NFR, in which case, our calculation indicates a reduction in NFR size. Alternatively, to invoke the Ramachandran and Henikoff model, if sufficient competition exists between regulatory factors and nucleosome assembly mechanisms, then it is less likely that a nucleosome will be inserted within the NFR (or that it will be captured in our measurements). In this case, our calculation indicates less of an effect on NFR size."

Accessibility increases by approximately two fold over each of the cell cycles measured, and there is less than a two-fold decrease in accessibility from mitosis into the subsequent early S-phase.

First, enhancers and insulators were identified using ChIP-seq data from much older embryos. What is the relevance of 0-12hr embryo data to NC11-NC13?

Do such conclusions about opening of promoters and enhancers hold up using groups of specific known genes that become active at different times?

The fact open configurations survive M seems clear, since embryos in M phase display no loss of open features. However, is it possible, due to changes in embryonic chromatin during sample preparation, that apparent maintenance might be an artifact of partial progression of some processes into the next cell cycle? Since changing levels of trans acting factors likely cause these chromatin features in the first place, the re-appearance of features after M phase is to be expected whether or not there is any epigenetic \"transcriptional memory.\" None of the data presented by the authors currently presents a convincing case that nucleosome positioning is inherited \"epigenetically\" and beyond that there were no functional tests of the importance of such inheritance.

It may be the most thermodynamically favorable way for the cell to deal with the task of chromatin condensation, or it may result from a previously unappreciated ability for trans-acting factors to remain associated with their DNA targets during mitosis.

As mentioned above, no chromatin accessibility data from GAF-null embryos exists, or is technically possible to obtain at the moment. Therefore, we obtained a 0-4 hour GAF ChIP-seq dataset from modEncode (accession# 3814) and tested for a correlation between binding and N:C ratio dependence. With the statistical analysis described above, we find that regions bound by GAF and not Zelda in this dataset are more likely to be NC ratio dependent with a p-value of 0.014 and a log2 odds ratio of 0.56. In the future, we hope to be able to address this issue more directly with more closely time-resolved GAF ChIP-seq data and hopefully loss of function accessibility data."
