The NPC barrier in <i>Xenopus</i> relies primarily on the intrinsically disordered FG domain of Nup98. We now observed that Nup98 FG domains of mammals, lancelets, insects, nematodes, fungi, plants, amoebas, ciliates, and excavates spontaneously and rapidly phase-separate from dilute (submicromolar) aqueous solutions into characteristic \u2018FG particles\u2019. This required neither sophisticated experimental conditions nor auxiliary eukaryotic factors. Instead, it occurred already during FG domain expression in bacteria. All Nup98 FG phases rejected inert macromolecules and yet allowed far larger NTR cargo complexes to rapidly enter. They even recapitulated the observations that large cargo-domains counteract NPC passage of NTR\u22c5cargo complexes, while cargo shielding and increased NTR\u22c5cargo surface-ratios override this inhibition. Their exquisite NPC-typical sorting selectivity and strong intrinsic assembly propensity suggest that Nup98 FG phases can form in authentic NPCs and indeed account for the permeability properties of the pore."

Nuclear pore complexes are large assemblies of proteins called nucleoporins. FG nucleoporins are special in that they contain regions with a repeating pattern of two amino acids, phenylalanine (\u2018F\u2019) and glycine (\u2018G\u2019). These regions are called FG domains. They bind to nuclear transport receptors and have been suspected to form a barrier that decides which molecules may pass through the nuclear pore complex. Exactly how this control is exerted has been a matter of debate."

It further assumes that repeat\u2013repeat contacts disengage locally and transiently when a transport receptor binds the corresponding FG motifs. This should allow the receptor to \u2018melt\u2019 with its cargo through the gel. Several lines of evidence support this model: first, replacing the highly cohesive FG domain of <i>Xenopus</i> Nup98 by non-cohesive (or by partially cohesive) ones resulted in non-selectively permeable NPCs (<a href=\"#bib30\">H\u00fclsmann et al., 2012</a>). This held true even if the replacing non-cohesive FG domain was fully proficient in NTR-binding.

Phase-separation was a matter of no more than seconds and occurred at critical concentrations ranging from 20 to 700 nM or 1 to 50 \u00b5g/ml FG domains, which corresponds to 1\u201335 \u00b5M FG motifs. These critical concentrations are exceeded by at least 2\u20133 orders of magnitude when the NPC scaffold initially recruits Nup98 molecules during NPC assembly. Notably, NTRs did not prevent the phase-separation of FG domains, even when present in larger excess than NPCs could possibly accommodate. The self-assembly process yielded micrometer-sized near-spherical FG particles with a preferred protein concentration of \u2248250 mg/ml. Strikingly, these particles behaved like the predicted selective phase: they excluded inert macromolecules (such as the \u224825 kDa-sized mCherry) but at the same time allowed efficient NTR entry at rates that appeared mostly limited by mass transport within the surrounding buffer. NTRs diffused through these particles with a rate constant in the order of 0.1 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s, i.e. fast enough to traverse a 40-nm thick NPC barrier made of the same material within \u224810 milliseconds. With remarkable clarity, the FG particles also recapitulated the effect that a larger cargo must recruit several NTR molecules in order to efficiently pass an NPC. The simplest explanation for these parallels is that the actual NPC barrier is formed by such phase-separated FG hydrogel material. Our data further suggest that a mere binding of a translocating species to FG domains is insufficient for facilitated passage. Instead, it is consistent with the notion that facilitated translocation involves an NTR-mediated melting of obstructing meshes and that this \u2018melting\u2019 is restricted to the immediate vicinity of the NTRs."

The solution was then rapidly diluted in 100 volumes of a neutral Tris/NaCl buffer, which lowered the protein concentration to 10 \u00b5M and the guanidinium ion concentration to negligible levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Remarkably, the Nup100 FG domain solution turned instantaneously turbid, pointing to a very rapid phase-separation and formation of small particles or liquid droplets, which can be easily recovered by centrifugation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We tried to record a time course of this reaction (by static light scattering) but had to realise that the reaction had already reached its endpoint before we could place samples into the instrument and start the measurement (after 10\u201330 s)."

Two stock protein solutions were prepared in 2 M guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl), 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0. They contained 300 \u00b5M of a Z-domain tandem fusion (labelled 1:1 with Atto565 maleimide) and 300 \u00b5M FG domain from either or Nsp1 (residues 274\u2013601) or Nup100. 5% of the FG domain molecules carried an Atto488 maleimide label. 16.7 \u00b5l of each solution was diluted with 500 \u00b5l 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl (TBS). Photographs show test tubes after ultracentrifugation (100,000\u00d7<i>g</i>, 30 min), illuminated at 366 nm.

Label-free ScNsp1<sub>276-601</sub> and ScNup100 FG domains were diluted from 400 \u00b5M stocks (in 2 M GuHCl) to the indicated concentrations with TBS. Formed particles were analysed by Dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a DynaPro NanoStar instrument (Wyatt Technologies).

CLSM images were taken after adding different dilutions of MBP-Alexa488, which served as an internal fluorescence standard. Correlating extra-particle Alexa488 signals (originating from MBP) with the known supplied MBP concentrations and matching them with the intra-particle Alexa488 signals (originating from 1/715th of the FG-domain molecules) suggests that an average particle contains \u22484.5 mM (\u2248275 mg/ml) FG-domain.

This \u2265200-fold oversaturation should thus drive FG phase-separation to completion also in real NPCs.

This applied to NTF2, Importin \u03b2 complexed with an Atto488-labelled IBB-domain or an IBB-GFP fusion, or even a 520 kDa octameric complex comprising four copies of Importin \u03b2 and the IBB-ZsGreen homotetramer.

We observed that all of them showed the same readiness to phase-separate and form FG particles as the ScNup100 FG domain (<a href=\"#fig6 fig7\">Figures 6 and 7</a>). The size distribution of particles differed between the various FG domains, which perhaps reflects different particle seeding and growth rates. But otherwise, the particles were mostly spherical and showed a rather even intra-particle FG domain distribution. In this species comparison, they were also remarkably similar in their intra-particle FG domain concentration (average 250 mg/ml, range 175\u2013350 mg/ml; see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Furthermore, not in a single case did the critical FG domain concentration for the phase-separation exceed 1 \u00b5M or 50 \u00b5g/ml, even when FG domains were O-glycosylated (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib38\">Labokha et al., 2013</a>). Remember that the local Nup98 FG domain concentration at NPCs should be at least 50 times higher, even if one assumes that the domains initially do not interact. Thus, a phase-separation of Nup98 FG domains into selective FG hydrogels should be thermodynamically highly favoured for the stoichiometry settings of authentic NPCs. Moreover, the striking conservation of the underlying biophysical properties throughout the eukaryotic kingdom can be taken as a very strong argument for a fundamental functional relevance."

They differ, for example, quite widely in their NQ-content (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), i.e., in a parameter that has been linked to the formation of amyloid-like structures, also in NQ-rich hydrogels (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alberti et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ader et al., 2010</a>). To test if these sequence differences also translate into different contents of amyloid-like cross-\u03b2 sheets, we stained the particles with ThioflavinT\u2014a compound whose 480 nm fluorescence emission is enhanced upon binding to NQ-rich and other amyloid-like cross-\u03b2 structures (<a href=\"#bib72\">Vassar and Culling, 1959</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Khurana et al., 2005</a>). Particles derived from the most NQ-rich FG domains, Nup100 (28%) and Nup116 (26%) showed indeed by far the strongest ThioflavinT signal, supporting that cross-\u03b2 structures can occur not only in amyloid fibres, but also in self-assembled FG particles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The NQ content alone is, however, not necessarily a reliable predictor for the presence of cross-\u03b2 sheets. The <i>C. elegans</i> Nup98 and the <i>Tetrahymena</i> MacNup98A FG domains, for example, have a very similar NQ-fraction (18%), yet we observed a clear ThioflavinT signal only for <i>C. elegans</i> FG particles. The <i>Tetrahymena</i> MacNup98A FG particles were essentially ThioflavinT-negative, perhaps because their high glycine content counteracts \u03b2-sheet formation and/or stability. FG particles from the other species also showed at most a weak ThioflavinT signature. Taken together, this suggests that particles from the selected FG domains sample different modes of inter-FG repeat interactions, and we were curious to find out if this would translate into different permselectivities."

This held true for Nup98 FG domains from nine evolutionary very distant species\u2014a clear indication for a strong evolutionary pressure to maintain the underlying physicochemical properties. As an additional indication, we noticed extreme sequence conservation amongst vertebrates, covering \u2248400 million years of evolution. The Nup98 FG domains from human and the fish <i>Lepisosteus oculatus</i>, for example, share \u224870% identical residues, which is close to the \u224875% identities between the corresponding globular autoproteolytic Nucleoporin 2 domains (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Moreover, most of the observed exchanges were just conservative permutations between T, S, A, and N within the spacers, while spacer lengths and the type of FG motif at a given position remained extremely conserved. The Nup98 FG domain is thus an exception from the rule that intrinsically disordered domains change rapidly during evolution (<a href=\"#bib15\">Denning and Rexach, 2007</a>). In fact, this indicates that the Nup98 FG domain engages in critical interactions along its entire sequence and that deviations from this optimal sequence are not well tolerated."

They have far fewer charged residues (median 2.5 \u00b1 0.4%) than either average IDP regions (28 \u00b1 7%) or globular proteins (24 \u00b1 3%). They are clearly more hydrophobic than typical IDP regions and, in fact, comparably hydrophobic as globular proteins. Thus, the Nup98 FG domains should have a similar potential to bury hydrophobic side chains from water as globular proteins. In contrast to the latter however, this does not result in a globular fold, but in strong inter-FG repeat cohesion. Taken together, the strong selection against charges and maintenance of hydrophobicity is well in line with our observation that Nup98 FG domains experience water as a \u201cpoor solvent\u201d and consequently phase-separate from even rather dilute solutions. The evolutionary conservation of the underlying sequence features suggests again a fundamental functional relevance."

For each protein sequence, the mean fraction of charged residues was determined by counting D, E, K, and R and dividing this sum by the sequence length. Mean hydrophobicity was calculated according to a scale based on partitioning of N\u03b1-acetyl-amino acid amides between 1-octanol and water at neutral pH (given in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> in <a href=\"#bib18\">Fauchere and Pliska, 1983</a>).

However, since there is no indication for a similar modification in ciliates and as the <i>Tetrahymena</i> Nup98A domain contains far fewer serines and threonines as potential modification sites than its vertebrate counterpart, we also had to consider other possibilities."

To test this, we replaced the \u224828 kDa GFP moiety by a single Atto488 molecule. This shrunk the cargo to the \u22486 kDa IBB domain, which gets entirely enwrapped by the Importin \u03b2 molecule leaving no cargo surface exposed (<a href=\"#bib24\">G\u00f6rlich et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cingolani et al., 1999</a>). As expected, the Importin \u03b2\u22c5IBB-Atto488 complex did not remain stuck at the particles' surface but accumulated in their interiors (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A</a>). In parallel controls with the same batch of particles, we observed that the Importin \u03b2\u22c5IBB-MBP-GFP complex (\u2248170 kDa) with a further enlarged cargo domain got again firmly arrested at the surface. Much to our surprise, however, we observed that a far larger \u2248530 kDa complex, namely a complex comprising four Importin \u03b2 molecules and an IBB-ZsGreen tetramer, crossed the buffer-particle boundary efficiently and accumulated strongly inside (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A</a> and <a href=\"#fig13s1\">13\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). How can this be explained? ZsGreen/zFP506 is a tetrameric homolog of GFP (<a href=\"#bib41\">Matz et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pletneva et al., 2007</a>). Consequently, the Importin \u03b2\u22c5IBB-GFP and Importin \u03b2\u22c5IBB\u22c5ZsGreen complexes have the same NTR:cargo mass ratios, but the tetramerisation buries much of the otherwise exposed cargo surface that counteracts entry into the FG phase. The tetramerisation should thus allow the Importin to dominate the surface properties of the entire complex, and hence to melt together with the cargo through the meshes of the gel."

This cargo includes two orthogonal nuclear import signals, the IBB-domain recruiting Importin \u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib24\">G\u00f6rlich et al., 1996</a>) and the M9-domain conferring nuclear import by Transportin (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pollard et al., 1996</a>). <a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13B</a> shows that neither Importin \u03b2 nor Transportin alone were sufficient to ferry the cargo across the buffer-particle boundary.

This cargo bound well to NPCs in the presence of importin \u03b2 alone, but rapidly traversed NPC only when both, Importin \u03b2 as well as Transportin, had been recruited (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ribbeck and G\u00f6rlich, 2002</a>).

More generally, this model is inconsistent with the observation that NPCs still exhibit superb permselectivity when saturated with NTRs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ribbeck and G\u00f6rlich, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Yang and Musser, 2006</a>)."

And neither can they explain why larger cargoes require multiple NTRs for efficient NPC passage (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ribbeck and G\u00f6rlich, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Tu et al., 2013</a>)."

As discussed in the following, the hydrogel model provides two complementary perspectives on this effect. In the first one, we consider the barrier as a \u2018solvent\u2019, into which NTRs, but not inert cargo domains, easily partition. An NTR would improve the cargo's solubility through its own FG affinity as well as by shielding the cargo domain. A complete NTR-assisted partitioning of the cargo into the FG phase would then be an essential stage during a successful NPC passage. Is the cargo, however, too large (in proportion to the NTR), then one would expect \u2018arrested\u2019 intermediates, in which the NTR has already partitioned into the FG phase, while the cargo domain is still excluded, because the energetic penalty is too high for rapidly immersing into the FG phase. Additional NTR molecules should minimise this penalty by further reducing the cargo's accessible surface area and by their own propensity to partition into the FG gel. Indeed, the experiments of <a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a> and <a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a> visualise such behaviour with remarkable clarity."

This melting should be restricted to the immediate vicinity of the NTR and thus become inefficient at distant parts of a large cargo. A second NTR molecule acting at this location should then solve this problem."

Yet, the following observations suggest a prominent contribution of Nup98 FG domains: (i) their extreme propensity to form selective barriers on their own (this study), (ii) their IDP-untypical evolutionary conservation (this study), (iii) their high copy numbers (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ori et al., 2013</a>), and (iv) their capacity to restore a selective permeability barrier in FG Nup-depleted NPCs (<a href=\"#bib30\">H\u00fclsmann et al., 2012</a>). Other FG domains will, however, also contribute by supplying additional (cohesive or adhesive) FG mass, by forming distinct FG gel layers (of similar or distinct selectivity) and perhaps by forming composite gels with the Nup98 FG domains. Such interplay between distinct FG domains will probably improve the robustness of the system, and it might indeed be an efficient way to fine-tune permselectivity. In the case of <i>Tetrahymena</i> we expect, for example, that such blending will relax the extremely tight TtMacNup98A FG hydrogel to a physiological optimum."

This is apparently achieved not only by the direct anchorage of the FG domains, but also by additional interactions between FG repeats and scaffold Nucleoporins, such as yeast Nic96p (<a href=\"#bib47\">Patel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schrader et al., 2008</a>), Nup188, Nup192 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andersen et al., 2013</a>), or vertebrate Nup93 (<a href=\"#bib80\">Xu and Powers, 2013</a>).

Furthermore, they also phase-separate spontaneously when expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. Importantly, the FG particles that are formed are highly selective and recapitulate key selectivity features of intact NPCs. Using FRAP, they further show that nuclear transport receptors (even with bound cargo) can rapidly diffuse in and out of these particles whereas the FG repeats themselves appear to be immobile."
