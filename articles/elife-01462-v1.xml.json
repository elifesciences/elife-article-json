While the post-ingestive rewarding effect, which artificial sweeteners do not have, signals the nutrient value of sugar and influences food preference, the neural circuitry that mediates the rewarding effect of glucose is unknown. In this study, we show that optogenetic activation of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons during intake of the artificial sweetener sucralose increases striatal dopamine levels and inverts the normal preference for sucrose vs sucralose. Conversely, animals with ablation of MCH neurons no longer prefer sucrose to sucralose and show reduced striatal DA release upon sucrose ingestion. We further show that MCH neurons project to reward areas and are required for the post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose in sweet-blind <i>Trpm5</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice. These studies identify an essential component of the neural pathways linking nutrient sensing and food reward."

While the post-ingestive rewarding effect, which artificial sweeteners do not have, signals the nutrient value of sugar and influences food preference, the neural circuitry that mediates the rewarding effect of glucose is unknown. In this study, we show that optogenetic activation of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons during intake of the artificial sweetener sucralose increases striatal dopamine levels and inverts the normal preference for sucrose vs sucralose. Conversely, animals with ablation of MCH neurons no longer prefer sucrose to sucralose and show reduced striatal DA release upon sucrose ingestion. We further show that MCH neurons project to reward areas and are required for the post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose in sweet-blind <i>Trpm5</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice. These studies identify an essential component of the neural pathways linking nutrient sensing and food reward."

Moreover, mutant mice that do not have any MCH neurons in the lateral hypothalamus show a reduced preference for sucrose over sucralose, compared to normal mice, and they release less dopamine than normal mice when they consume sucrose."

This post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose was first described by showing that non-nutritive liquids that are paired to glucose administration either in the intra-gastric tract or in plasma, are greatly preferred over liquids that are not paired with nutrients (<a href=\"#bib5\">de Araujo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ren et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">de Araujo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Oliveira-Maia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Sclafani et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fernstrom et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">de Araujo et al., 2013</a>). In addition, sweet-blind <i>Trpm5</i> knockout mice can still sense the nutrient value of sucrose (<a href=\"#bib5\">de Araujo et al., 2008</a>). These studies have indicated that the nutrient value of sucrose is sensed and in turn establishes a preference for nutritive sugars (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ren et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">de Araujo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Sclafani et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fernstrom et al., 2012</a>). These data further indicate that the post-ingestive rewarding effect plays an important role in driving nutrient choice (in addition to sweet taste). However, despite the substantial evidence that they play a major, perhaps dominant, role in driving food intake and sweetener preference, the neural pathways that sense glucose and mediate the post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose have not been identified."

In addition, MCH neurons send dense projections to reward centers in the striatum and midbrain where dopaminergic neurons are located (current report). This strong anatomical connection between MCH neurons and reward nuclei, as well as the fact that MCH neurons sense glucose levels, led us to hypothesize that these hypothalamic neurons could play a role in conveying the reward value of sucrose."

We characterized <i>Pmch</i>-CRE mice and thus confirmed tissue- and cell-specific expression of ChR2-YFP in MCH neurons as shown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The YFP signal was seen in the LH with the characteristic appearance of MCH neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and there was a 92 \u00b1 8% overlap of YFP and MCH. In addition, 97 \u00b1 3% of MCH neurons expressed ChR2-YFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in slice preparations confirmed light-evoked spiking at 5, 10, and 20 Hz (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), as well as during continuous light pulses of one second (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The spike rate of MCH neurons was higher with light pulses of 20 Hz vs 5 Hz.

ChR2(+) and ChR2(\u2013) mice had equal preference for water+laser vs water alone at all stimulation frequencies tested (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We next compared an animal\u2019s preference for sucrose vs sucralose plus optogenetic activation of MCH neurons (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for the rationale of concentrations chosen).

However, consistent with the greater effect of 20 Hz on spiking of MCH neurons in slice preparation, a light frequency of 20 Hz, as well as continuous light, inverted an animal\u2019s preference with a strong preference for sucralose plus MCH activation relative to sucrose (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

We thus tested whether the inversion of preference to sucralose by activating MCH neurons was correlated with increases in striatal DA release as measured by microdialysis in ChR2(+) mice (<a href=\"#bib5\">de Araujo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">de Araujo et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). After signal stabilization, samples were collected during a 30-min period when the animals had access to sucralose (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). As previously reported, animals drinking sucralose (without light stimulation) displayed negligible changes in striatal DA levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Animals drinking sucralose when the laser was set to OFF displayed an overall 8.2 \u00b1 2.6% change from baseline DA (average across all S1\u2013S5 samples); this change was not significantly different from baseline (gray bars in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> p&gt;0.05, one sample T-test against 100% baseline). However, when sucralose ingestion was coupled to laser stimulation of MCH neurons, DA release significantly increased in the striatum (**p&lt;0.008; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013G</a>, blue bars). When laser was set to ON during ingestion of sucralose, DA levels increased 68.7 \u00b1 9% vs baseline DA (average across all S1\u2013S5 samples, blue bars in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This increase is not only significantly different from baseline and the OFF condition, but is also significantly different from DA release after experimenter-controlled (i.e., direct) delivery of laser pulses, in the absence of sucralose ingestion (light blue bar in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, ****p&lt;5.7e10<sup>\u22127</sup>, t-test, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). Each animal received the same number of pulses as the number of laser pulses during ingestion of sucralose in the ON condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Mice used in condition laser-ON were the same as in condition laser-OFF. Optogenetic activation of MCH neurons markedly increased sucralose ingestion during the laser ON condition (*p&lt;0.05; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) while activation of MCH neurons did not change intake of water (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As mentioned above, optogenetic stimulation of MCH neurons paired to water was not preferred to water alone, showing that activation of MCH neurons is not rewarding in the absence of sucralose. Thus, both MCH activation and the presence of sucralose were required to establish a change of preference."

However, it is also possible that glucose is sensed elsewhere, such as by putative gastric/intestinal sensors or other nutrient sensors, which inform the brain and MCH neurons about the nutrient content of ingested food (<a href=\"#bib26\">Sclafani et al., 2011</a>). Glucose sensing in MCH neurons or elsewhere would explain why, even in the absence of taste (such as in <i>Trpm5</i><sup>\u2013/\u2013</sup> mice), sucrose is able to drive significant increase of striatal DA. This increase, in turn, conveys reward and conditions behavior (<a href=\"#bib5\">de Araujo et al., 2008</a>). We note, however, that optogenetic stimulation of MCH neurons alone is not sufficient to alter behavior in the absence of taste. The data thus suggest that MCH neurons are components of a reward-encoding network that integrates information from multiple sources, including the nutrients themselves, lingual taste buds and, possibly, other sites of glucose sensing like the gut. Consistent with this possibility, viral tracing from lingual taste buds shows that MCH neurons are part of a circuit processing gustatory information (<a href=\"#bib22\">P\u00e9rez et al., 2011</a>). This finding is also consistent with the optogenetic data reported here, showing a requirement for both sweet taste and activation of MCH neurons to drive reward. The role of MCH neurons uncovered here contrasts with that of DA neurons, which upon optogenetic stimulation have been shown to be rewarding when paired to water (<a href=\"#bib7\">Domingos et al., 2011</a>)."

This synergy would also explain why our optogenetic gain of function experiments lead to an inversion of preference, rather than an isopreference, which could perhaps have been achieved by decreasing the concentration of sucralose. Likewise, the loss of function of MCH neurons leads to isopreference, but this could perhaps be biased toward sucralose by increasing its concentration. Further studies will be necessary to establish the relevant sites of glucose sensing, identify additional elements of the neural circuit integrating gustatory perception with nutrient sensing and reward, as well as elucidating the neural mechanisms by which MCH neurons regulate striatal DA release. Several methods including viral tracing can be used to identify monosynaptic or polysynaptic inputs onto MCH and DA neurons."

Moreover, a loss of function of Kir6.1 in MCH neurons leads to alterations in results of a glucose tolerance test with increased plasma glucose at later times, establishing a role for these neurons in glucose homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kong et al., 2010</a>). Further studies are required to establish whether these or other components of glucose sensing pathways are also required for the ability of MCH neurons to influence sucrose preference. It is possible, however, that additional neural populations are components of this nutrient sensing circuit.

These augmented locomotor phenotypes contrast with the behavioral effect we see with a loss of sucrose preference in MCH ablated mice. It is possible that the locomotor phenotypes in response to stimulants result from actions in the ventral striatum, where the MCH receptor (MCHR-1) is expressed, and that sucrose preference relies on other brain areas. Further experiments will be required to ascertain which brain areas and MCH projections are relevant for sucrose preference. Loss of function of MCHR-1 recreates the locomotor phenotypes seen in <i>Pmch</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice: <i>Mchr1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice are super-sensitive to the locomotor activating effects of d-amphetamine (<a href=\"#bib30\">Smith et al., 2005</a>).

Mice were euthanized at the beginning of the light cycle (9:00 AM), and brain slices containing the LH were cut at 300 \u03bcm (2/mouse). Slices were transferred to a chamber at room temperature to stabilize in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). Slices were then transferred to a recording chamber after \u22651 hr recovery and constantly perfused at 34\u00b0C with bath solution at a speed of 1.5 ml/min. Whole cell patch-clamp recording was performed on identified MCH-YFP neurons with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments, New York, NY). The patch pipettes were made of borosilicate glass (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) with a Sutter pipette puller (P-97).

During the acclimation and exposure periods mice were water deprived for 16\u201323 hr and were given water through the bottles inside the chamber for half an hour. In addition, stimuli in 10 min two-bottle tests were side balanced across the same genoptype group, being received either through the left bottle or through the right bottle. Two-bottle preference was calculated as the ratio: preference for 1 = number of licks on bottle 1/(number of licks on bottle 1+number of licks on bottle 2) and expressed as percentage values, with 50% representing the indifference ratio (referred to as isopreference in the \u2018Results\u2019 section). Behavioral data was analyzed with Excel and Prism, and expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Significance tests comparing groups were ANOVAs or <i>t</i> tests and, when appropriate, followed by Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. Two-bottle tests without laser stimulation were carried out in the same setup, with the laser turned off. The size of each animal group is represented by \u2018n\u2019, and each animal was tested three times. The investigator was blind to the genotype. In all cases, concentration of sucrose was 0.4M and concentration of sucralose was 1.5 mM. These concentrations were based on previous literature (consult supplementary figure-4 in <a href=\"#bib7\">Domingos et al., 2011</a>). Briefly, the differences in molarity of sucrose and sucralose reflect differences in ligand-binding affinity of either sweetener to taste receptors, and were chosen among the plateau values of behavioral dose-response curves (preference for either sweetener versus water in <a href=\"#bib7\">Domingos et al., 2011</a>). Volume dispensed by the lickometers averages 2 \u03bcl/lick (<a href=\"#bib7\">Domingos et al., 2011</a>). Locations of optical probes were confirmed histologically (data not shown). For each light stimulation regimen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, mice in top and bottom panels are the same. After animals were corrected for any spontaneous side bias, and prior to the 10-min testing data in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, animals had a 10-min pre-exposure to either one of the two stimuli in two consecutive days. The pre-exposure procedure is intended to avoid novelty-related artifacts. On day one animals had exposure to water, followed by water+laser the day after. On the third day animals were tested for water vs water+laser for 10 min. On the fourth day, animals had exposure to sucrose, followed by sucralose+laser the day after. On the sixth day animals were tested for sucrose vs sucralose+laser for 10 min."

Briefly, after recovery from surgery and behavioral habituation, a microdialysis probe (2 mm CMA-7, cut off 6 kDa, CMA Microdialysis, Stockholm, Sweden) was inserted into the striatum through the guide cannula (the corresponding CMA-7 model). After insertion, probes were connected to a syringe pump and perfused at 1.2 \u03bcl/min with artificial CSF (Harvard Apparatus). After a 90 min washout period, dialysate samples were collected every 6 min and immediately manually injected into a HTEC-500 HPLC unit (Eicom, Japan). Analytes were then separated via an affinity column (PP-ODS, Eicom), and compounds subjected to redox reactions within an electro-chemical detection unit (amperometric DC mode, applied potential range from 0 to \u223c2000 mV, 1 mV steps). Resulting chromatograms were analyzed using the software EPC-300 (Eicom, Japan), and actual sample concentrations were computed based on peak areas obtained from 0.5 pg/\u03bcl dopamine standards (Sigma) and expressed as % changes with respect to the mean dopamine concentration associated with baseline (i.e., behavioral task) samples. Animals were water deprived for 16\u201323 hr, and rested in their home cages for baseline sample collection until values were stable.

Detection of GFP was done first. Sections were incubated for 2 hr in biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) and the immunoperoxidase\u2013DAB procedure was applied using avidin-biotin complex (Vectastain Elite ABC kit from Vector Laboratories), followed by diaminobenzidine and urea tablets (Sigma) for 10 min.

These data add further evidence to our conclusion that MCH neurons regulate the activity of DA neurons in the VTA but do not address whether the ability of MCH neurons to activate these neurons is direct or indirect (Dr Blackshaw correctly points out that this could possibly be mediated via orexin neurons or another neural population).

We had initially viewed further studies of the precise neural mechanism by which leptin reduces the reward value of sucrose as the subject of a future and comprehensive paper on this topic as the mechanism may or may not involve effects on MCH neurons. In addition, we will have to adopt an alternative strategy to address this question since both MCH neuronal ablation and leptin treatment diminish the reward value of sucrose. Rather, we are planning to assess whether leptin treatment alters the preference of animals for sucralose plus MCH activation vs sucrose. In the revised Discussion, we emphasize the importance of defining the mechanism by which leptin modulates this circuit and because MCH neurons do not express leptin receptor (<a href=\"#bib16\">Leinninger, et al., 2011</a>), we also discuss the possible role of other neural populations in LH."
