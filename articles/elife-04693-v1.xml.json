                    "text": "As we navigate through the world, eye and head movements add rotational velocity patterns to the retinal image. When such rotations accompany observer translation, the rotational velocity patterns must be discounted to accurately perceive heading. The conventional view holds that this computation requires efference copies of self-generated eye/head movements. Here we demonstrate that the brain implements an alternative solution in which retinal velocity patterns are themselves used to dissociate translations from rotations. These results reveal a novel role for visual cues in achieving a rotation-invariant representation of heading in the macaque ventral intraparietal area. Specifically, we show that the visual system utilizes both local motion parallax cues and global perspective distortions to estimate heading in the presence of rotations. These findings further suggest that the brain is capable of performing complex computations to infer eye movements and discount their sensory consequences based solely on visual cues."

When such rotations accompany observer translation, the rotational velocity patterns must be discounted to accurately perceive heading. The conventional view holds that this computation requires efference copies of self-generated eye/head movements. Here we demonstrate that the brain implements an alternative solution in which retinal velocity patterns are themselves used to dissociate translations from rotations. These results reveal a novel role for visual cues in achieving a rotation-invariant representation of heading in the macaque ventral intraparietal area. Specifically, we show that the visual system utilizes both local motion parallax cues and global perspective distortions to estimate heading in the presence of rotations. These findings further suggest that the brain is capable of performing complex computations to infer eye movements and discount their sensory consequences based solely on visual cues."

Such non-visual signals can represent several different sources of rotation, including eye-in-head (R<sub>EH</sub>), head-on-body (R<sub>HB</sub>), and body-in-world (R<sub>BW</sub>) movements (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Critically, retinal image motion is determined by the translation and rotation of the eye relative to the world (T<sub>EW</sub> and R<sub>EW</sub>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), such that extracting heading from optic flow requires compensating for the total rotation of the eye-in-world (where, R<sub>EW</sub> = R<sub>EH</sub> + R<sub>HB</sub> + R<sub>BW</sub>).

If the brain can use optic flow to directly estimate and discount rotations of the eye-in-world (R<sub>EW</sub>), such mechanisms may provide a complementary and potentially more efficient way to decompose rotations and translations to achieve invariant heading perception. Psychophysical studies have provided evidence that visual cues may play a role in estimating heading in the presence of rotations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grigo and Lappe, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Li and Warren, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Crowell and Andersen, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Li and Warren, 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Royden et al., 2006</a>).

Our results provide novel evidence that (1) a subpopulation of VIP neurons utilizes visual cues to signal heading in a rotation-invariant fashion and (2) both local motion parallax and global perspective cues present in optic flow contribute to these computations. In addition, we find that visual and non-visual sources of rotation elicit similar responses in VIP, suggesting multi-sensory combination of both visual and non-visual cues in representing rotations.

This change is often conceptualized as a shift in the focus of expansion (FOE) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Warren and Hannon, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bradley et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shenoy et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2002</a>). However, in a visual scene with depth structure, adding rotation results in different FOE shifts at different depths (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2004</a>). This is due to a key difference in the properties of optic flow resulting from translations and rotations\u2014the magnitudes of translational optic flow vectors decrease with distance (depth), whereas rotational optic flow vectors are independent of depth (<a href=\"#bib37\">Longuet-Higgins and Prazdny, 1980</a>). Hence, for more distal points in a scene, rotations produce a larger FOE shift (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For the translation and rotation parameters used in this study, the nearest plane in the 3D cloud (25 cm) results in an FOE shift of approximately 20\u00b0. However, for any plane farther than 45 cm, the resultant optic flow has an undefined FOE (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, top row). The simulated 3D cloud ranged from 25 cm to 125 cm, resulting in a large volume of the stimulus space having undefined FOE shifts. Since FOE shift is an ill-defined measure of the visual consequence of rotations, we simply refer to the net visual stimulation associated with simultaneous translation and rotation as the \u2018resultant optic flow\u2019."

On the other hand, backward translations produce a contractionary flow field and adding a rightward rotation results in a leftward shift in the focus of contraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). If a neuron signals heading regardless of the presence of rotations, then its tuning curves during real and simulated pursuit should be identical to the heading tuning curve measured during pure translation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). For a neuron that instead represents the resultant optic flow rather than the translation component (heading), a transformation of the tuning curve is expected due to the added rotations. As a result of the opposite shifts expected for forward (expansionary flow field) and backward translations (contractionary flow field), the heading tuning curve of a neuron preferring forward headings would have a peak that shifts to the right and a trough that shifts to the left during rightward eye rotation; together, these effects cause a skewing of the tuning curve (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, red curve). For the same neuron, leftward eye rotation would cause the peak to shift to the left and the trough to shift to the right, thus having an opposite effect on the shape of the tuning curve (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, blue curve). Neurons that prefer lateral headings, which are common in VIP (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2011</a>), may in fact, show no shift in the peak.

During simulated pursuit, however, the tuning curves of this neuron show clear bandwidth changes. Thus, this second example neuron appears to rely more on non-visual cues to discount rotations. Note that this example neuron preferred lateral headings (leftward) and showed large bandwidth changes during SP, as predicted in the schematic illustration of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>. Such bandwidth changes were observed consistently among VIP neurons that preferred lateral translations; specifically, rightward rotations increased bandwidth for cells preferring rightward headings (\u223c0\u00b0) and decreased bandwidth for cells preferring leftward headings (\u223c180\u00b0), with the opposite pattern holding for leftward rotations (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

It is also critical to distinguish between changes in response gain and changes in the shape (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; see Discussion) of tuning curves, which our analysis allows because we sample the entire heading tuning curve (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mullette-Gillman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang and Snyder, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rosenberg and Angelaki, 2014</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, the first step in the analysis involves normalizing each RP and SP tuning curve to match the dynamic range of the pure translation tuning curve. Following this transformation, the change in the shape of the RP and SP tuning curves can be measured without ambiguity. To account for the expected changes in bandwidth and skew, partial shifts of the tuning curve were measured separately for forward (0\u00b0:180\u00b0) and backward (180\u00b0:360\u00b0) headings. Thus, four shift values were obtained from each neuron for both real and simulated pursuit, corresponding to forward/backward headings and left/right rotation directions. These four values were averaged for each neuron to quantify the transformation in shape and obtain one shift metric for RP tuning curves and one for SP tuning curves (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

A positive shift indicates under-compensation for rotation, such that responses change in a manner consistent with the resultant optic flow. Negative shifts indicate that the tuning curve transformation was in the direction opposite to that expected based on the resultant optic flow. This can be interpreted as an over-compensation for rotation. As noted earlier, though the FOE shift for the nearest depth plane (25 cm) in our stimuli is 20\u00b0, a majority of the cloud volume (45\u2013125 cm deep) is dominated by rotations, such that the resultant optic flow has undefined FOEs.

The rank order of the responses (1\u20131, 2\u20132, 3\u20133) would be identical for the two curves, which previous methods would erroneously interpret as evidence for rotation-invariance (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bremmer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kaminiarz et al., 2014</a>).

The mean shift (black markers) approaches the true shift (20\u00b0, dashed line) for tuning curves with heading preferences near 90\u00b0, but the mean shifts are grossly inaccurate for simulated neurons with lateral heading preferences.

These two sources of information differ in that the non-visual source signals the rotation of the eye relative to the head (R<sub>EH</sub>) and the visual source signals the rotation of the eye relative to the world (R<sub>EW</sub>). Previous studies have shown that VIP receives efference copies of pursuit eye movements (<a href=\"#bib10\">Colby et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Duhamel et al., 1997</a>), reflecting an R<sub>EH</sub> signal.

These results support the hypothesis of multi-sensory convergence of visual and non-visual cues to provide consistent rotation information, which may be critical for encoding rotations, in addition to achieving a rotation-invariant representation of heading."

To gain a deeper understanding of the visual mechanisms involved in dissociating translations and rotations, we investigated which optic flow properties are used by the visual system to infer self-motion from visual cues. <a href=\"#bib25\">Helmholtz and Southall (1924)</a> and <a href=\"#bib21\">Gibson (1950)</a> suggested that local motion parallax information plays an important role in deciphering self-motion based on the depth structure of a scene. In a 3D environment, two points can have similar retinal locations, but different depths. As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, optic flow vectors resulting from observer translation are dependent on depth, producing different retinal velocities for points at different depths. This difference in velocity between nearby points at different depths gives rise to local motion parallax. Rotations, on the other hand, produce image motion that is not depth-dependent, and therefore lacking local motion parallax. As a result, for a rich 3D environment, computing the local difference between optic flow vectors corresponding to points at different depths allows the rotational component of optic flow to be subtracted away (<a href=\"#bib37\">Longuet-Higgins and Prazdny, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rieger and Lawton, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Warren and Hannon, 1990</a>), and the singularity point of the resulting motion parallax field (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) corresponds to the observer's heading. This solution requires rich depth structure in the scene, which is not always present.

This more accurately simulates the real world situation in which approaching a wall reduces its distance from the observer over time. As a result, the speed of the translation component of optic flow increased over time for forward translations as the distance to the wall decreased (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since rotational optic flow is invariant to the distance from a wall (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the resulting shift in FOE due to added rotations changed over time in our stimulus. During the middle 750 ms of a forward translation stimulus, real or simulated pursuit results in an average FOE shift of 37\u00b0. Hence, heading tuning shifts significantly smaller than 37\u00b0 would provide evidence for the hypothesis that the visual system can use dynamic perspective cues to discount rotations."

The median values were also significantly different from each other (Wilcoxon signed-rank test; p = 0.03) and greater than 0\u00b0 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test; p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, 8/34 (23.5%) neurons during RP and 5/34 (14.7%) neurons during SP had shifts that were not significantly different from 0\u00b0 (darker colors in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), implying rotation-invariant heading responses. Only 6/34 (17.6%) neurons during RP and 12/34 (35.3%) neurons during SP showed shifts that were statistically greater than or not different from 37\u00b0 (95% CI; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). These results indicate that, even in the absence of non-visual signals and 3D visual cues such as local motion parallax, a large sub-population of VIP neurons can use global perspective cues to at least partially mitigate the effect of rotations on heading tuning. Shifts measured during simulated pursuit in the 3D cloud experiments were significantly less than shifts measured using the FP plane (Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 0.02). This implies that both local motion parallax cues arising from translations, and global features such as dynamic perspective cues arising from rotations play important roles in visually dissociating translations and rotations."

Therefore, the average eye position is the same as the average head position. As a result, time-averaged neural responses may provide insight into what signal is represented (heading or resultant optic flow), but not about whether these signals are represented in an eye- or head-centered reference frame. To evaluate reference frames, responses must be examined with the eye at different positions relative to the simulated heading. In our experiments, we can examine the temporal responses of neurons to study reference frames since the translation direction in eye coordinates changes over time. Accordingly, an eye-centered representation of heading would result in systematic temporal response variations due to the rotating reference frame, and these variations would be different for leftward and rightward rotations of the eye. In contrast, a head-centered representation would result in responses that are constant over time, and similar for rightward and leftward rotations during both real and simulated pursuit."

It is important to note that these trends are determined by the changing eye position and are independent of how tolerant the heading representation is to rotations (i.e., the extent of compensation). The degree of rotation compensation would result in a shift in the mean firing rate away from the pure translation responses (as discussed in previous sections), irrespective of the reference frame in which translations are represented. Therefore, neurons can represent translations invariant to rotations in either a head-centered or an eye-centered reference frame."

Therefore, we identified the heading corresponding to the largest positive gradient for each tuning curve, and examined the temporal dynamics of responses for that direction. In order to determine the expected temporal changes in firing rate under the assumption of an eye-centered reference frame, the slope of the tuning curve at the heading corresponding to the largest gradient was calculated for each normalized tuning curve.

The slopes observed in VIP responses correspond to an intermediate reference frame that lies closer to an eye-centered frame than a head-centered reference frame.

Since the temporal response profile was essentially flat during the translation only condition (slope = 0.01/s, 95% CI = [\u22120.04 0.06]) and opposite trends are observed for rightward vs leftward rotations, these response patterns cannot be explained by other basic aspects of neural response dynamics, such as adaptation."

Importantly, rotation invariance can be achieved using both non-visual and purely visual cues. Previous neurophysiology literature emphasized the importance of non-visual cues, especially efference copy signals, but clear evidence for the role of visual cues has been missing, as discussed below. In contrast, our study provides novel evidence for the role of visual cues in discounting rotations and representing heading. Furthermore, we show that both local motion parallax and global dynamic perspective visual cues present in optic flow play a significant role in decomposing the components of self-motion. The importance of visual signals is reinforced by our finding that VIP neurons also carry rotation signals derived from purely visual cues. The significant correlation between visual and non-visual rotation responses is consistent with a multi-sensory representation of rotations. In addition, we resolve an important ambiguity in the literature between the concepts of tolerance to rotations and reference frames. Specifically, we examine the effect of a rotating eye reference frame on visual responses to show that rotation tolerance does not necessarily imply a head-centered reference frame. Our findings show conclusively that visual cues play a significant role in achieving rotation-invariant heading representations."

The efference copy signals for each of these sources of rotation depend on the specific motor commands generating the movement. If we consider that eye, head, and body rotations are often generated simultaneously, multiple efference copy signals must be added together and subsequently discounted from the resultant optic flow to signal heading accurately. Each of these non-visual signals is associated with signal-dependent noise (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gellman and Fletcher, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Li and Matin, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Crowell et al., 1998</a>); thus, combining multiple, potentially independent, efference copy signals to estimate rotations may not always be an efficient solution for the brain. On the other hand, the information contained in visual cues is independent of the source of rotation and represents rotation of the eye relative to the world (R<sub>EW</sub>). The R<sub>EW</sub> information present in optic flow inherently reflects the sum of all the different sources of rotation (R<sub>EW</sub> = R<sub>EH</sub> + R<sub>HB</sub> + R<sub>BW</sub>) and thus provides direct information regarding the total rotation of the eyes during self-motion. Therefore, visual signals may have important advantages when the goal is to accurately estimate heading in the presence of self-generated rotations."

In order to compare results across these studies, we calculated the degree of compensation as the difference between the error in heading perception and the shift in FOE based on the experimental parameters, normalized by the expected shift in FOE ([FOE shift-heading error]/FOE shift). The rotation compensation observed in these studies during simulated pursuit (only visual cues) ranged from 100% to 20% for a 3D cloud stimulus (based on the depth plane corresponding to the screen distance).

However, these studies used visual stimuli with a small field of view and a low density of dots in the 3D cloud, thus limiting the visual information available for estimating heading in the presence of rotations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grigo and Lappe, 1999</a>).

On the other hand, if all VIP neurons are decoded with equal weights, we would expect the behavioral errors to be comparable to the mean compensation observed in the neural population. It is also important to note that in many behavioral studies, subjects made small but significant errors even during real pursuit (<a href=\"#bib18\">Freeman, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Freeman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Crowell and Andersen, 2001</a>), consistent with our finding that the average compensation among VIP neurons is not complete even when both visual and non-visual cues to rotation are available."

In behavioral studies that eliminate this ambiguity through specific instruction to subjects, heading errors during simulated pursuit are reported to be largely reduced (<a href=\"#bib35\">Li and Warren, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Royden et al., 2006</a>). This provides further evidence that the visual system is indeed capable of estimating rotation-invariant heading based on purely visual stimuli. It is also possible that the range of compensation observed in our data could be a result of this perceptual ambiguity. To evaluate how the brain resolves this ambiguity, neurophysiological studies using both path-independent rotations and curved path stimuli are needed."

Such a moving image boundary defined only by the rotation velocity would not occur under natural conditions as a result of eye rotations. By changing the region of visual space that was stimulated over the course of a trial, <a href=\"#bib46\">Shenoy et al.

However, these studies only measured neural responses to three headings (forward, 30\u00b0 leftward, and 30\u00b0 rightward), and defined rotation-tolerance based on a rank-ordering of heading responses across the different eye movement conditions. Since absolute firing rates were not considered, it is likely that shifts in tuning curves could go undetected by this method in the presence of gain fields or bandwidth changes. For instance, this analysis would report identical rank-order for the tuning curves shown in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, and would erroneously classify them as rotation-invariant. In addition, the authors did not attempt to compare their results to the tuning shifts that would be expected if neurons do not compensate for rotation. Consider that, in their ground-plane stimuli (e.g., <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> of <a href=\"#bib26\">Kaminiarz et al., 2014</a>), rotation has a large effect on slow-speed optic flow vectors near the horizon, and high-speed foreground vectors are much less altered. For neurons with receptive fields below the horizontal meridian or those with responses dominated by high speeds, one might not expect the rank ordering of heading responses to change even if neurons do not compensate for rotation.

For instance, the visual consequences of eye or head rotations need to be discounted in order to accurately perceive whether an object is stationary or moving in the world. The neuroscience literature has extensively studied and emphasized the contribution of efference copy signals to discounting self-generated movements in several sensory systems (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersen, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cullen, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Klier et al., 2005</a>).

For instance, driving along a winding path and looking in the direction of instantaneous heading does not result in any eye or head movements relative to the body (i.e., no efference copy signals). However, such curvilinear motion still introduces rotational components in the optic flow field and disrupts the FOE. In order to estimate such motion trajectories, the visual system would need to decompose self-motion into both translational and rotational components. This study suggests that such trajectory computations based purely on optic flow may be feasible. How the visual system may implement such computations warrants further research and may provide useful insights to neuroscientists as well as those in the fields of computer vision and robotic navigation."

Optic flow stimuli simulated eight headings within the horizontal plane, corresponding to all azimuth angles in 45\u00b0 steps. The pure translation stimuli were rendered by translating the OpenGL camera along one of the eight headings with the velocity profile shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>. (ii) For the real pursuit (RP) condition, the animal actively pursued a moving target while the same translational optic flow stimuli as above were presented on the display screen. A rightward rotation trial started when the fixation target appeared 9.5\u00b0 to the left of center. Once the monkey fixated this target (within 1000 ms), it moved to the right following a trapezoidal velocity profile (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Analogously, leftward pursuit trials began with the target appearing on the right and moving leftward. The monkey was required to pursue the moving visual target and maintain gaze within a 4\u00b0 eye window during the acceleration and deceleration periods (0:375 ms and 1125:1500 ms). During the middle 750 ms of the trial (constant velocity phase), the monkey was required to maintain gaze within a 2\u00b0 window around the visual target. Importantly, the optic flow stimulus was windowed with a software rendered aperture that moved simultaneously with the pursuit target. Thus, the area of the retina being stimulated during the RP trials remained constant over time, eliminating potential confounds from moving the stimulus across the receptive field over time (see \u2018Discussion\u2019).

Without measuring the full tuning curve, it is very difficult to distinguish between gain fields and shifts in the tuning curves (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mullette-Gillman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang and Snyder, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rosenberg and Angelaki, 2014</a>).

However, as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, rotations can change the shape of the tuning curve, including both skew and bandwidth changes. Therefore, we suspect that the cross-correlation methods or rank-ordering of responses used in previous studies are insufficient to characterize all of the changes in heading tuning due to rotations (see also <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Step 1: we measured the minimum and maximum responses of the pure translation tuning curve. The lowest response (trough) and amplitude (maximum\u2014minimum) of the RP/SP tuning curves were then matched to those of the pure translation curve by vertically shifting and scaling the responses, respectively. Step 2: because the predicted effects of rotation are opposite for forward and backward headings (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), RP and SP tuning curves were split into heading ranges of 0\u2013180\u00b0 and 180\u2013360\u00b0. We tested whether each half of the tuning curve was significantly tuned using an ANOVA (p \u2264 0.05). All the tuning curves were then linearly interpolated to a resolution of 1\u00b0. Step 3: for half-curves that showed significant tuning, we performed a shift analysis as follows. The pure translation tuning curve was circularly shifted (in steps of 1\u00b0) to minimize the sum-squared error with each half of the RP/SP tuning curves. For neurons that were significantly tuned in all conditions and in both direction ranges, this analysis yielded four shift values for real pursuit and four shifts for simulated pursuit. In order to quantify the transformation of heading tuning due to rotations, the four shift values were averaged to arrive at one shift value for real pursuit and one shift for simulated pursuit for each cell."

Specifically, simulated tuning curves were generated by sampling the von Mises functions at headings in the range of \u00b132\u00b0 around straight ahead, with 8\u00b0 sampling intervals. To match the previous studies, the resulting data were then smoothed with a three-point moving average and interpolated using a spline function at 1\u00b0 intervals (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C,E</a>).

The predicted slopes for an eye-centered reference frame were calculated as the average gradient for all the neurons for a given condition (dashed lines in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). To test whether the temporal responses match this prediction, the time course of firing rate was measured at the heading associated with the largest positive gradient, for neurons recorded during the 3D cloud protocol. For sharply tuned neurons, it is possible that the true largest gradient lay between sampled headings. Hence, the measured largest gradient could be part of the peak or trough of the tuning curve. To account for such instances in the data, we excluded tuning curves for which the mean response at the largest gradient heading was not significantly different (t-test; p \u2264 0.05) from the responses of its immediate neighboring headings (29/360 total tuning curves from 72 cells). The time course of firing rate during each trial for the selected heading was calculated by convolving the spike events with a Gaussian kernel (\u03c3 = 25 ms).

The problem is that the degree to which the monkey makes use of these cues is not clear. In an ideal world, the authors could train monkeys to report estimated heading and demonstrate that the monkey compensates, even partially, for rotation induced changes in FOE when it estimates heading (e.g. heading estimates are still pretty good even if made during pursuit). However, this would not be a straightforward experiment to carry out because the changes in FOE induced by pursuit are small, and the monkey's estimates of heading would probably be noisy to begin with. Further, this would entail an entirely new set of experiments that would probably take years to carry out."

This would naturally be speculative, but it could provide a very addition to the paper for the following reason: <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> makes clear that neurons vary continuously in the degree to which they are rotation invariant. Indeed, a good handful of neurons (third quadrant) shift in the wrong direction! Of neurons that do shift in the right direction, it is clear that invariance to rotation does not define a category of neurons specialized for this task.

The problem is that the degree to which the monkey makes use of these cues is not clear. In an ideal world, the authors could train monkeys to report estimated heading and demonstrate that the monkey compensates, even partially, for rotation induced changes in FOE when it estimates heading (e.g. heading estimates are still pretty good even if made during pursuit). However, this would not be a straightforward experiment to carry out because the changes in FOE induced by pursuit are small, and the monkey's estimates of heading would probably be noisy to begin with.

Such a stimulus corresponds to the impossible scenario in which an observer translates towards a wall, but the distance between the observer and the wall does not change.
