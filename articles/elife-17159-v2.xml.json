To date, the mechanisms of KCNQ channel modulation have been mostly characterized to be inhibitory via Gq-coupled receptors, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, and protein kinase C. Here we demonstrate that methylation of KCNQ by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (Prmt1) positively regulates KCNQ channel activity, thereby preventing neuronal hyperexcitability. <i>Prmt1+/-</i> mice exhibit epileptic seizures. Methylation of KCNQ2 channels at 4 arginine residues by Prmt1 enhances PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, and <i>Prmt1</i> depletion lowers PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity of KCNQ2 channels and thereby the channel activities. Consistently, exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> addition to <i>Prmt1+/-</i> neurons restores KCNQ currents and neuronal excitability to the WT level. Collectively, we propose that Prmt1-dependent facilitation of KCNQ-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction underlies the positive regulation of KCNQ activity by arginine methylation, which may serve as a key target for prevention of neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures."

To date, the mechanisms of KCNQ channel modulation have been mostly characterized to be inhibitory via Gq-coupled receptors, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, and protein kinase C. Here we demonstrate that methylation of KCNQ by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (Prmt1) positively regulates KCNQ channel activity, thereby preventing neuronal hyperexcitability. <i>Prmt1+/-</i> mice exhibit epileptic seizures. Methylation of KCNQ2 channels at 4 arginine residues by Prmt1 enhances PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, and <i>Prmt1</i> depletion lowers PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity of KCNQ2 channels and thereby the channel activities. Consistently, exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> addition to <i>Prmt1+/-</i> neurons restores KCNQ currents and neuronal excitability to the WT level. Collectively, we propose that Prmt1-dependent facilitation of KCNQ-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction underlies the positive regulation of KCNQ activity by arginine methylation, which may serve as a key target for prevention of neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures."

Worldwide, about 1% of the population suffers from epilepsy, and nearly 4% of the population will experience epilepsy at some point during their lifetime (<a href=\"#bib40\">Malkki, 2014</a>). In almost 30% of patients with epilepsy, anti-seizure medications do not provide sufficient seizure control (<a href=\"#bib40\">Malkki, 2014</a>). Thus, understanding the etiology of epilepsy is essential both for clinical management of patients and for conducting neurobiological research that will direct future therapies. The etiology of epilepsy was formerly regarded as unknown in about three-quarters of patients; however, massively parallel gene-sequencing studies showed the importance of gene mutations in the etiology of epilepsy (<a href=\"#bib61\">Thomas and Berkovic, 2014</a>). Among those epileptic conditions linked to channelopathies, mutations in potassium channel subunits represent the largest category (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brenner and Wilcox, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cooper, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Noebels, 2003</a>). Together with KCNA1, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are the earliest identified K<sup>+</sup> channels associated with idiopathic epilepsy (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rogawski, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schroeder et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Browne et al., 1994</a>). More than 30 mutations have been detected in KCNQ channels, most of which were found in KCNQ2: only four mutations were found in KCNQ3 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Maljevic et al., 2010</a>). These mutations caused a reduction in channel activity by different molecular mechanisms, by which all can lead to membrane depolarization and increased neuronal firing."

                        "text": "In the central nervous system (CNS), heteromeric KCNQ2/3 potassium channels form the M-current, a subthreshold potassium current (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delmas and Brown, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jentsch, 2000</a>). Due to the slow gating kinetics, M-currents effectively oppose sustained membrane depolarization and repetitive action potential (AP) firing (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brown and Passmore, 2009</a>). Thus, breakdown of M-channels by loss of function mutations or pharmacological inhibitors leads to neuronal hyperexcitability (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schroeder et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Delmas and Brown, 2005</a>). KCNQ potassium channels are standouts for epileptologists, in that they are both mutated in human epilepsy and principal targets of an approved anti-epileptic drug (ezogabine/retigabine) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gunthorpe et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Soldovieri et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, regulation of KCNQ channel activity has been studied by many groups (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delmas and Brown, 2005</a>). Notably, M-channels are inhibited by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, leading to a profound increase in cellular excitability that can be reversed by the withdrawal of receptor agonist. Some subtypes of receptors for dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and several peptide neurotransmitters, including luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and bradykinin, are also found to be capable of inhibiting the M-channels. An important property of M-channels is that they require membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) to open (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delmas and Brown, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Suh and Hille, 2008</a>), and the certain receptors mentioned above suppress M-current by depletion of PIP<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delmas and Brown, 2005</a>). In addition, M-channels are also inhibited by CaM in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, providing another mode of intracellular modulation of M-channel activities (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gamper and Shapiro, 2003</a>). Recent work indicates that protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of the KCNQ2 subunit reduces the affinity for its PIP<sub>2</sub> binding and activities (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kosenko et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). Likewise, sumoylation of KCNQ channels results in reduced channel activity (<a href=\"#bib47\">Qi et al., 2014</a>). Thus, all regulatory pathways discovered so far act on the KCNQ channels to reduce the channel activity and increase neuronal excitability. Given its important role in stabilization of neuronal excitability, <i>there has</i> been much speculation for regulatory mechanisms to increase the channel-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction and channel activities, however, to date <i>there is no</i> evidence supporting such regulatory mechanism."

Protein arginine methyltransferases (Prmts) are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to arginine residues of histone or non-histone substrates (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boisvert et al., 2005</a>). In mammals, nine Prmts have been characterized. Among these, Prmt1, originally identified as a histone H4 methyltransferase, methylates many non-histone proteins and implicated in diverse cellular processes including RNA processing, transcriptional regulation, oncogenesis, cell survival, insulin signaling, and metabolism (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boisvert et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bedford and Clarke, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Krause et al., 2007</a>).

Considering that each additional methyl group to an arginine residue can readily modulate their physical properties (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bedford and Clarke, 2009</a>), methylation of arginine residues in PIP<sub>2</sub> binding domain may alter KCNQ channels' affinity for PIP<sub>2</sub>. However it is not known whether such methylation really occurs and regulates the channel activity and whether it is implicated in common disease phenotypes. In the present study, the role of arginine methylation of KCNQ in regulation of channel activities and neuronal excitability was investigated. <i>Prmt1</i>-heterozygous (+/-) mice exhibit epileptic seizures. We also found that <i>Prmt1</i> depletion causes a decreased interaction between PIP<sub>2</sub> and KCNQ channels, consequently causing a reduction in KCNQ channel activity. Prmt1 interacts and methylates at 4 arginine residues of KCNQ channels. Hippocampal neurons from the heterozygote mice lack KCNQ currents, and the current can be restored by exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> addition, accompanied by concomitant rescue of normal excitability. Furthermore a pharmacological inhibition of methylation or methylation-deficient mutants of KCNQ2 reduce PIP<sub>2</sub> binding and activities of KCNQ channels. These data demonstrate that protein arginine methylation facilitates KCNQ channel-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction, leading to seizure suppression. We propose that Prmt1-dependent regulation of KCNQ channels represents an important mechanism of neuronal protection against over-excitability."

To identify neural mechanisms underlying spontaneous seizure activities in <i>Prmt1</i>+/- mice, we performed electrophysiological recordings from the dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs) of hippocampal slices from WT and mutant mice. GCs from WT mice typically displayed tonic firing patterns in response to a 1-s square current pulse injection: AP frequency elevated as the magnitude of the square pulse increased (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a and c</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). GCs from <i>Prmt1</i>+/- mice showed significantly higher AP frequency than those from WT mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b and c</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). The averaged AP frequency in response to a 200 pA depolarizing current in WT GCs was 8.1 \u00b1 1.4 Hz (<i>n</i> = 16), while it increased significantly to 31.2 \u00b1 2.2 Hz (<i>n</i> = 18, p&lt;0.01) in <i>Prmt1</i>+/- GCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). These data indicate that the heterozygous deletion of the <i>Prmt1</i> gene enhanced excitability of hippocampal neurons. To determine whether the increased firing resulted from a change in the threshold current, we compared the magnitude of the current injection to reach a threshold for AP firing (AP threshold current) in WT and <i>Prmt1</i>+/- GCs. Representative traces in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d,e</a> clearly show that the current for spike initiation was reduced in <i>Prmt1</i>+/- neurons. Analysis of pooled results revealed a significant decrease in the mean threshold current in <i>Prmt1</i>+/- GCs compared to that in WT GCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>, the change in threshold current was correlated with an increase in the input resistance. The amplitude and duration of APs obtained in WT were not altered by the reduction of the Prmt1 gene dose (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2h and i</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Therefore, the change in the threshold current in <i>Prmt1</i>+/- neurons reflects the effect on input resistance, which facilitates their AP initiation and, hence, increase in spike number."

An increase in neuronal excitability without a change in AP height and width indicated that the kinetics and amplitude of voltage-gated currents associated with the spike itself were not affected. Increased cation current or leak current was unlikely to be involved in the phenotype, either, as this would be expected to result in a decrease in input resistance. Thus, the most probable target was the KCNQ/M channel. KCNQs are voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels that partially open at the resting membrane potential. Inhibiting the KCNQ channel increases both input resistance and neuronal excitability (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jentsch, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brown and Passmore, 2009</a>). Thus, we examined whether M-channel deficiency contributed to increased neuronal excitability of <i>Prmt1</i>+/- mice. The M-current amplitude was measured using a standard deactivation voltage protocol (<a href=\"#bib45\">Peters et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lawrence et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Adams et al., 1982</a>). In GCs from WT mice, a step to -60 mV forced deactivation of a slowly relaxing outward current that decayed, consistent with the presence of M-current. The M-channel antagonist XE991 (10 \u03bcM) caused a complete loss of detectable M-current (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>), accompanied by a reduction in the holding current. However, <i>Prmt1</i>+/- GCs showed little measurable M-currents (p&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b\u2013c</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Thus, these results showed that <i>Prmt1</i>+/- GCs displayed a high firing rate at baseline, and their firings did not further increase during XE-991 application, suggesting that defective M-current contributes to the neuronal hyperexcitability observed in the <i>Prmt1</i>+/- mice. However, we cannot exclude the potential involvement of other Prmt1 target(s) in the neuronal hyperexcitability observed in the <i>Prmt1</i>+/- mice."

The treatment of WT hippocampal slices with MTA (100 \u03bcM) or furamidine dihydrochloride (20 \u03bcM) for 1 hr completely abolished M-currents (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013c</a>; p&lt;0.001 vs WT control, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). We then studied their effects on neuronal excitability. The application of MTA (100 \u03bcM, 1 hr) enhanced neuronal excitability of WT GCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d\u2013e</a>). After the MTA treatment, AP frequency in response to a 200 pA depolarizing current was 34.7 \u00b1 4.6 Hz. Consistent with ablation of M-currents by MTA, subsequent application of XE991 had no further effect (AP frequency was 31.8 \u00b1 3.9 Hz) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d\u2013e</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). The MTA-induced increase in excitability was accompanied by the declined AP threshold currents and increased input resistance (threshold current, 110.5 \u00b1 5.5 pA, <i>n</i> = 4; input resistance, 234.0 \u00b1 5.8 M\u03a9, <i>n</i> = 4), which were relatively insensitive to a subsequential treatment with XE991 (p&gt;0.05; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4j\u2013k</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Furthermore, the treatment of WT hippocampal slices with furamidine dihydrochloride exhibited a <i>similar</i> effect on neuronal excitability, input resistance, and threshold current, confirming the results obtained with MTA treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f\u2013g\u00a0and\u00a0j\u2013k</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). However, methylation suppression with MTA had no effect on AP firing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h\u2013i</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>), threshold current (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4j</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>), or input resistance (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4k</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>) in <i>Prmt1</i>+/- GCs. Thus, these data suggest that the reduction of Prmt1 activity in the hippocampal neurons might be responsible for the neuronal hyperexcitability in <i>Prmt1</i>+/- neurons."

To investigate a potential interaction between KCNQ2 and Prmt1, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted with HEK293T cells.

The intracellular C-terminal region of KCNQ2 encompassing amino acids 320\u2013840, designated as KCNQ2-C, was sufficient to interact with Prmt1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b and c</a>). To further confirm the interaction between KCNQ2 and Prmt1 proteins in the native neuronal environment, co-immunoprecipitation was performed with mouse hippocampal lysates.

Four arginine residues such as Arg333 (R333), Arg345 (R345), Arg353 (R353), and Arg435 (R435), were identified as methylated in vivo (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To determine whether Prmt1 methylates KCNQ2, we performed in vitro methylation assays using various bacterially purified GST-Prmts (Prmt1-6) or myc-tagged Prmt5 purified from HEK293T cells and GST-KCNQ2 (amino acids 320\u2013449) that contain all of four arginine residues identified by mass spectrometry. GST-KCNQ2 was methylated by Prmt1, but not by other Prmts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We next examined whether the newly identified methylation sites were direct targets for methylation by Prmt1. KCNQ2 mutants in each of which either R333, R345, R353, or R435 were substituted with lysine (further referred as RK mutants) were generated and analyzed by in vitro methylation assay with Prmt1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a>). While the single arginine-to-lysine substitutions did not result in observable decrease of methylation (data not shown), the reduction in KCNQ2 methylation was readily detected with the double RK mutants, R333K/R353K, R345K/R353K, or R345K/R435K. This was further declined in the triple mutant of R333K/R345K/R353K, compared to double mutants. Furthermore, substitution of the four Arg\u2019s in KCNQ2 (4RK, R333K/R345K/R353K/R435K) completely abolished the methylation by Prmt1, suggesting that these four arginine residues are critical targets for Prmt1-dependent methylation."

Conversely, Prmt1 overexpression enhanced KCNQ2 methylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5h</a>). We next examined the arginine methylation status of KCNQ2 channels in WT or <i>Prmt1</i>+/- brains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5i</a>). The immunoprecipitation analysis showed that ADMA-positive KCNQ2 proteins were readily detected in the WT brain, which were significantly reduced in that of <i>Prmt1</i>+/-. These results strongly advocate that Prmt1 interacts with and methylates KCNQ2. Prmt1 and Prmt8 often share substrates in vitro, and PRMT8 is neuron-specific (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kousaka et al., 2009</a>). We analyzed whether Prmt8 contributes to hypo-methylation of KCNQ2 proteins in <i>Prmt1</i>+/- brains. The protein expression of Prmt8 in the <i>Prmt1</i>+/- brain was unaltered from WT brain (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Thus, Prmt8 might not be involved in the decreased KCNQ2 methylation in <i>Prmt1</i>+/- brain. Taken together, these data indicate that reduced Prmt1 levels cause hypo-methylation of KCNQ2 in the <i>Prmt1</i>+/- brain."

Using the conventional whole-cell patch clamp technique, the channel function was measured by applying 'step' pulses from \u201370 to +40 mV in 10-mV increments at a holding potential of \u201360 mV for 1 s, followed by a tail pulse to \u201360 mV. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a> demonstrates representative whole-cell current traces recorded from KCNQ2-transfected HEK293T cells. Consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 2010</a>), KCNQ2-transfected cells displayed slowly activating outward currents and tail currents. In non-transfected cells, we observed small endogenous outward currents at positive voltage step pulses, but no tail currents (data not shown). The shRNA-mediated depletion of <i>Prmt1</i> decreased KCNQ current density from 57.6 \u00b1 7.6 pA/pF of control transfected cells to 26.3 \u00b1 7. 6 pA/pF. Rectification of the <i>I</i>-V curves was not changed by <i>Prmt1</i> knockdown. To verify the role of Prmt1-mediated methylation in KCNQ2 channel function, the effect of Prmt1 inhibitors on KCNQ2 current was examined. In agreement with <i>Prmt1</i> knockdown data, the treatment of MTA or furamidine dramatically reduced the KCNQ2 currents (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c\u2013d</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). The KCNQ2 currents were confirmed by XE991 treatment.

Interestingly, the methylated arginine residues, R333, R345, R353, and R435, reside in the PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding domain of KCNQ2 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Suh and Hille, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hernandez et al., 2008</a>). This led us to postulate that methylation might affect the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding affinity of KCNQ2 thereby regulating channel activities."

                                "text": "To appraise the affinity of PIP<sub>2</sub> for KCNQ2, we utilized neomycin, which is widely used to sequester PIP<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liscovitch et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Haider et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Suh and Hille, 2007</a>).Since neomycin is a polycation that binds specifically to PIP<sub>2</sub>, it has been used to determine the PIP<sub>2</sub> content in biological membranes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arbuzova et al., 2000</a>). The neomycin sensitivity of ion channels such as Kir and KCNQ is well regarded as a measure of its PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Haider et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Suh and Hille, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kosenko et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schulze et al., 2003</a>). Accordingly, ion channels with high PIP<sub>2</sub> affinities are expected to be less sensitive to neomycin than those with low PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity. Inclusion of 10 \u03bcM neomycin in the patch pipette solution led to a moderate inhibition of the WT KCNQ2 current in HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). In contrast, mutant channels with reduced methylation showed greatly increased inhibition by 10 mM neomycin. So, the remaining current at 10 min time points after rupturing the membrane is significantly reduced from 81.2 \u00b1 1.9% (WT, n\u00a0=\u00a05) to 48.7 \u00b1 4.2% (R333K, n\u00a0=\u00a05, p&lt;0.01; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). We measured dose-responses to neomycin. In comparison with WT, methylation-deficient mutant KCNQ2 (R333K, R345K, R353K, R435K) exhibited a higher sensitivity to neomycin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>), suggesting lower PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity. To directly examine whether these channels have different PIP<sub>2</sub> sensitivity, we included 20 \u03bcM or 200 \u03bcM diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> in the patch pipette solution and measured current augmentation after rupturing the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c and d</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). WT KCNQ2 did not show increase in current by diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> even at 200 \u03bcM, suggesting that endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> might be at a saturating concentration. In contrast, methylation-deficient mutant KCNQ2 (R333K, R345K, R353K, R435K, 4RK) showed a dose-dependent increase in current but they did not reach to WT level at corresponding concentrations of PIP<sub>2</sub>. Only R333K reached to the WT level when introduced to 200 \u03bcM PIP<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, 4RK appeared to be most severely affected in PIP<sub>2</sub> binding. Altered PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity in RK mutants was also assessed by a voltage-sensitive phosphatase from Danio rerio (Dr-VSP), which hydrolyzes PIP<sub>2</sub> at highly depolarized voltages (e.g., +100 mV) and transiently reduces the PIP<sub>2</sub> level (<a href=\"#bib16\">Falkenburger et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rjasanow et al., 2015</a>). Dr-VSP was coexpressed with WT KCNQ2 or RK mutants and its activity was elicited by membrane depolarization. Consistent with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib16\">Falkenburger et al., 2010</a>), activation of Dr-VSP reduced WT KCNQ2 currents and currents were recovered quickly after PIP<sub>2</sub> resynthesis on repolarization (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2\u2014source data 1</a>). When subjecting RK mutants to the same VSP activation protocol, the overall behavior was similar to the WT KCNQ2 channel; however, the recovery of current was slowed 2\u20134 folds (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2\u2014source data 1</a>). The mean time to the 70% maximum current (T<sub>70</sub>) for R333K, R345K, R353K and R435Kwas 22.8 \u00b1 3.7, 24.1 \u00b1 1.9, 32.1 \u00b1 2.6, and 17.9 \u00b1 1.5 s, respectively (p&lt;0.05 vs WT:9.5 \u00b1 3.1\u00a0s). The slowed recovery after VSP reflects the reduced PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rjasanow et al., 2015</a>), further supporting for the reduced PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity of RK mutants. Taken together, these data suggest that methylation of KCNQ2 channel regulates its interaction with PIP<sub>2</sub>."

We found that PIP<sub>2</sub> loading decreased the firing rate toward normal values in <i>Prmt1</i>+/- GCs. For example, the AP frequency of <i>Prmt1</i>+/- GCs in response to a 200 pA depolarizing current was 31.2 \u00b1 2.2 Hz, and decreased to 15.5 \u00b1 2.9 Hz following PIP<sub>2</sub> loading (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7k</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>).

These results suggest that the impaired KCNQ channel function in the hippocampus of <i>Prmt1</i>+/- mice can be restored by PIP<sub>2</sub> addition. Although the recovery of excitability with PIP<sub>2</sub> application was significant it was incomplete, suggesting the possible involvement of other Prmt1 target(s) in neuronal hyperexcitability. As immediate candidates, we tested other K<sup>+</sup> channels such as SK and BK channels in Prmt1 effects which are known to regulate membrane excitability of dentate gyrus GCs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brenner et al., 2005</a>). The data obtained by using apamin and paxilline, specific SK and BK channel blockers, respectively, ruled out that the contribution of these channels in hyperexcitability of <i>Prmt1</i>-deficient GCs (<a href=\"#fig7s5\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, <a href=\"#SD11-data\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 5\u2014source data 1</a>).

Taken together, genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of Prmt1 reduces the affinity between the KCNQ channel and PIP<sub>2</sub>, leading to reduction of KCNQ currents accompanied by neuronal hyperexcitability."

The mean current augmentation induced by 500 \u03bcM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was 2.6 \u00b1 0.2-fold (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9h</a>). At the concentration of 500 \u03bcM, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effect usually reached a plateau within 7~8 min of application. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effect was completely reversed by the addition of a reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT, 2 mM), suggesting that this effect is due to a reversible oxidative modification. Notably, DTT-reduced KCNQ2 currents in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells were back to the resting level within several minutes, but did not inhibit them further (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>). Also, DTT had no effect on KCNQ2 currents in non- H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells (data not shown). When protein arginine methylation was blocked with the treatment of MTA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9b</a>) or furamidine (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9c</a>), KCNQ2 channels appeared to be insensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with the currents augmented by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (500 \u03bcM) by 0.9 \u00b1 0.02-fold and 0.8 \u00b1 0.03-fold, respectively (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9h</a>, <a href=\"#SD13-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1</a>).

The heterozygous reduction of the <i>Prmt1</i> gene dose in mice caused spontaneous seizures. The elevated neuronal excitability in <i>Prmt1</i>+/- mice appears to be a direct result of reduced KCNQ/M channel activities in that KCNQ2 from the <i>Prmt1</i>+/- brain was less asymmetrically methylated and showed diminished affinity to PIP<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the activation of KCNQ channel under oxidative stress as well as its basal activity at rest depends on protein arginine methylation. It is well known that ROS generated under oxidative stress induces augmentation of KCNQ currents in neurons (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gamper et al., 2006</a>). The resulting reduction in neuronal discharge lowers electrical activity of the cell and energy consumption, thereby providing an important mechanism of protecting neurons from the oxidative stress-induced death (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gamper et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Won et al., 2002</a>). Considering that oxidative stress is also involved in induction of seizures (<a href=\"#bib44\">Patel, 2004</a>), the impairment of neuroprotective KCNQ activation in response to oxidative stress, may contribute to spontaneous seizures together with the reduced basal activity of KCNQ channels in <i>Prmt1</i>+/- mice. Protein arginine methylation is a unique post-translational modification that increases the KCNQ/M channel function unlike other known regulatory signaling pathways, and thus provides a platform for the design of novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy and other neuronal hyperexcitability disorders."

Interestingly, all of the methylation sites reside within the C-terminal PIP<sub>2</sub> binding domain. This is known as a 'hot spot', as it serves as binding sites for multiple signaling molecules as well as PIP<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delmas and Brown, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hernandez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>). The observation that decreased methylation lowers PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity proposes that Prmt1 methylation on the arginine residues would increase channel-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction. Indeed, previous computational analyses revealed that methylation renders the guanidinium of arginines to be more electron-rich and thus to exhibit higher pKa values (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shearer, 2008</a>), which would stabilize the positive charge of the arginine residue in proteins in the physiological condition and thereby likely facilitate their electrostatic interaction with negatively charged molecules. Thus, it is conceivable that arginine methylation is required for the KCNQ channel activity because it promotes electrostatic binding of KCNQ proteins to PIP<sub>2</sub>."

Mutations in the C-terminal region of KCNQ channels reduce channel activities by interfering with channel targeting to the surface membrane (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schwake et al., 2000</a>), protein stability (<a href=\"#bib56\">Soldovieri et al., 2006</a>), interaction with calmodulin (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jentsch, 2000</a>), or modulation by cAMP (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schroeder et al., 1998</a>). Mutations affecting the pore region of KCNQ2 may reduce currents by affecting ion channel conductance, while mutations at the S4 domain affect channel gating and increase the threshold for channel activation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Maljevic et al., 2010</a>). It is interesting in this context that R353G, a mutant of one of the major methylation sites identified in this study, is linked to familial epilepsy, likely due to reduced calmodulin binding and a consequent defect in membrane trafficking (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jentsch, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Etxeberria et al., 2008</a>). However, a recent study proposed an additional pathophysiological mechanism involving a diminished PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity of the channel for this epileptic KCNQ2 mutation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kosenko et al., 2012</a>). This is in agreement with our current study indicating that disruption of KCNQ2 channel-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction caused by decreased methylation is a key mechanism linked to neuronal hyperactivity."

Considering that the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 complex produces M-currents, hypo-methylation of either KCNQs might significantly diminish M-currents and neuronal hyperexcitability. The positively charged arginines are also important for electrostatic interaction with PIP<sub>2</sub> in other PIP<sub>2</sub>-sensitive channels and transporters such as Kir2 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hansen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Huang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lopes et al., 2002</a>), and GIRK (<a href=\"#bib62\">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</a>).

Consistent with this, our results show that the effects of KCNQ channel block on firing rates are not the same as those of Prmt1 block (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), implying a possible involvement of other Prmt1 target(s) in neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures. PIP<sub>2</sub> loading to <i>Prmt1</i>+/- GCs recovered the firing properties significantly but incompletely. It appears that SK and BK channels are not involved in this matter. Thus further studies are required to identify other Prmt1 targets in the control of neuronal excitability. Regardless, the results presented here provide the first direct evidence of functional role for protein arginine methylation in the control of neuronal excitability and also offers a platform to further investigate the physiological and pathophysiological roles of KCNQ/M channel activity in CNS."

Mice were killed by decapitation after being anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, and the whole brain was immediately removed from the skull and chilled in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at 4\u00b0C. Transverse hippocampal slices (350 \u03bcm thick) were prepared using a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica, Germany, Nussloch). Slices were incubated at 35\u00b0C for 30 min and thereafter maintained at 32\u00b0C until in situ slice patch recordings and fluorescence microscopy. Hippocampal granule cells of the dentate gyrus were visualized using an upright microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics (BX51WI, Olympus, Japan, Tokyo). Whole-cell current clamp techniques were used for excitability of dentate granule cells (GCs). The pipette solution contained (in mM): 143 K-gluconate, 7 KCl, 15 HEPES, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 4 Na-ascorbate, and 0.1 EGTA/or 10 BAPTA with the pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH.

PIP<sub>2</sub> (10\u2013500 pmol) was spotted on Hybond-C extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences, USA, New Jersey). Spotted membranes were blocked with 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma USA, Missouri) in TBST for 1 hr at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with cell lysates for 2 hrs at room temperature, followed by washing and detection with anti-HA antibody."

The PRMT1 +/- mice are shown to have spontaneous seizures as well as a change in excitability of dentate granule neurons of the hippocampus, accompanied by a smaller M-current in those neurons. Through a series of electrophysiological and biochemical evidence, the authors show that KCNQ2 channels are indeed methylated and directly interact with PRMT1. The targeted arginines are within a previously identified KCNQ2 PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site, leading to the proposal that methylation of KCNQ2 channels alters their affinity for PIP<sub>2</sub>. likely producing changes in their probability of opening."

The PRMT1 +/- mice are shown to have spontaneous epileptic seizures as well as a dramatic change in the excitability of the dentate granule neurons of the hippocampus. The authors nicely show that PRMT1 associates with the KCNQ2 channel, or with its isolated C-terminus, by immunoprecipitation. They use LC-MS to identify the four arginines that are methylated in KCNQ2, and to show that substituting 2 to 4 of these arginines reduces (or eliminates) the methylation. These mutations also dramatically reduce the KCNQ2 currents in a heterologous system, though they did not eliminate protein expression or the current in the presence of the channel activator retigabine."

Based on this data, they speculated loss of PRMT1 most likely caused a decreased to the M-current (KCNQ2/3), a potassium conductance critical for neuronal excitability. This is the first demonstration of KCNQ2 channels being targeted for methylation. The evidence that KCNQ2 channels are methylated is convincing."

However, the lack of change in the firing rate by XE991 might be due to a ceiling effect as the PRMT1+/- DGC fired at 34Hz when XE991 was applied, unlike the control cells that fired at 8Hz. The authors should have tested the effect of XE991 in neurons that fired the same number of action potentials by simply adjusting the injected current. The same ceiling issue is for all experiments done with XE991 in the presence of different PRMT1 blockers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

Using this approach the rate and extent of KCNQ2/3 current inhibition following PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion as well as the rate of current recovery following PIP<sub>2</sub> restoration could be measured. Also relating to this point, the authors state that inclusion of 200uM diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> in the pipette did not increase KCNQ2 currents suggesting that endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> might be at saturating concentrations (subsection Arginine methylation of KCNQ2 is required for maintaining PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity\u201d, third paragraph). This finding is inconsistent with all previous papers on KCNQ2 channels and PIP<sub>2</sub>. See work by Shapiro and colleagues on PIP<sub>2</sub> as well as Brown DA and colleagues on PIP<sub>2</sub> and KCNQ2 and KCNQ2/3 channels. All papers agree that increasing endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> levels leads to an increase in KCNQ2/3 currents, as their PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity is low."

So, it is unclear why mutating S6 arginines alone leads to abrogation of the hydrogen peroxide effect on KCNQ2 channels (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Please clarify."

In addition to firing rates, we analyzed all the parameters of intrinsic firing properties including threshold current, input resistance, and resting membrane potential. PRMT1+/- GCs required ~90pA less current injection than WT GCs to achieve AP, which we think facilitates their AP initiation and, hence, increase in spike number. The change in the threshold currentin PRMT1+/- neurons reflects the change of input resistance. Thus, it is of note that, even though XE991 treatment fully recapitulates firing rates observed in PRMT1+/- mice, it does increase input resistance to the level that was not different from that in PRMT1+/- mice. On the other hand, XE991 reduced threshold current by ~30pA, which is less effective than PRMT1 blocker."

The remaining current of RK mutants was small but still responsive to VSP activation.
