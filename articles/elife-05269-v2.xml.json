                    "text": "The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) monitors and promotes kinetochore\u2013microtubule attachment during mitosis. Bub1 and BubR1, SAC components, originated from duplication of an ancestor gene. Subsequent sub-functionalization established subordination: Bub1, recruited first to kinetochores, promotes successive BubR1 recruitment. Because both Bub1 and BubR1 hetero-dimerize with Bub3, a targeting adaptor for phosphorylated kinetochores, the molecular basis for such sub-functionalization is unclear. We demonstrate that Bub1, but not BubR1, enhances binding of Bub3 to phosphorylated kinetochores. Grafting a short motif of Bub1 onto BubR1 promotes Bub1-independent kinetochore recruitment of BubR1. This gain-of-function BubR1 mutant cannot sustain a functional checkpoint. We demonstrate that kinetochore localization of BubR1 relies on direct hetero-dimerization with Bub1 at a pseudo-symmetric interface. This pseudo-symmetric interaction underpins a template\u2013copy relationship crucial for kinetochore\u2013microtubule attachment and SAC signaling. Our results illustrate how gene duplication and sub-functionalization shape the workings of an essential molecular network."

Bub1 and BubR1, SAC components, originated from duplication of an ancestor gene. Subsequent sub-functionalization established subordination: Bub1, recruited first to kinetochores, promotes successive BubR1 recruitment. Because both Bub1 and BubR1 hetero-dimerize with Bub3, a targeting adaptor for phosphorylated kinetochores, the molecular basis for such sub-functionalization is unclear. We demonstrate that Bub1, but not BubR1, enhances binding of Bub3 to phosphorylated kinetochores. Grafting a short motif of Bub1 onto BubR1 promotes Bub1-independent kinetochore recruitment of BubR1. This gain-of-function BubR1 mutant cannot sustain a functional checkpoint. We demonstrate that kinetochore localization of BubR1 relies on direct hetero-dimerization with Bub1 at a pseudo-symmetric interface. This pseudo-symmetric interaction underpins a template\u2013copy relationship crucial for kinetochore\u2013microtubule attachment and SAC signaling. Our results illustrate how gene duplication and sub-functionalization shape the workings of an essential molecular network."

Overlack, Primorac et al. also identified a region in Bub1 that binds to Bub3, and which is considerably different in BubR1. When this region of Bub1 was grafted into BubR1, the resulting protein was able to bind kinetochores even in the absence of Bub1."

Bub1 becomes recruited to kinetochores in prometaphase to provide a platform for additional SAC proteins, including Mad1, Mad2, the BubR1/Bub3 complex, and Cdc20. Bub1 promotes the assembly of a subset of these proteins, Mad2, BubR1/Bub3, and Cdc20, into the SAC effector, the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which targets the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to inhibit its ability to promote mitotic exit (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</a>). Bub1, not in itself a MCC subunit, likely catalyzes MCC assembly by aligning MCC subunits for a profitable interaction (discussed in <a href=\"#bib46\">Overlack et al., 2014</a>).

                        "text": "Bub1 and BubR1 have different kinetochore dynamics, likely reflecting their distinct functions in the SAC. Bub1 interacts stably with unattached kinetochores, in agreement with its function as a SAC recruitment platform, while BubR1 turns over rapidly (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 3\u201320 s), likely reflecting its cycle of incorporation into MCC and its release into the cytosol as a soluble APC/C inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib20\">Howell et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Shah et al., 2004</a>). Besides different dynamics, another important difference is that kinetochore recruitment of Bub1 is independent of BubR1, while recruitment of BubR1 is strictly subordinate to Bub1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Millband and Hardwick, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gillett et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Johnson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Perera et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Logarinho et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Klebig et al., 2009</a>). The molecular basis for these differences is unclear, because both Bub1 and BubR1 bind a kinetochore-targeting adaptor named Bub3. Bub3 is a 7-WD40 \u03b2-propeller that targets kinetochores by binding to phosphorylated Met-Glu-Leu-Thr<sup>P</sup> (MELT<sup>P</sup>, where T<sup>P</sup> indicates phosphothreonine) repeats of the outer kinetochore subunit Knl1 (a.k.a. Casc5, Spc105, Spc7, AF15q14, and Blinkin) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kiyomitsu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Krenn et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">London et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shepperd et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yamagishi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Primorac et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Bub3 binds tightly to Bub1 and BubR1 via conserved segments known as Bub3-binding domain (B3BD) or GLEBS (<a href=\"#bib58\">Taylor et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Larsen et al., 2007</a>). By recognizing MELT<sup>P</sup>, Bub3 co-recruits Bub1 to kinetochores in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Primorac et al., 2013</a>). In human cells, Bub3 is required for kinetochore recruitment of Bub1 and BubR1, and consistently the B3BDs of Bub1 and BubR1 are necessary, and in the case of Bub1 also sufficient, for kinetochore targeting of Bub1 and BubR1 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Taylor et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Logarinho et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Malureanu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Elowe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Krenn et al., 2012</a>). The subordination of BubR1 kinetochore recruitment to the presence of Bub1 suggests that Bub3 may operate differently when bound to Bub1 or BubR1. In this study, we set out to investigate the molecular basis of this phenomenon and its implications for spindle checkpoint signaling and kinetochore\u2013microtubule attachment."

Bub1<sup>209\u2013270</sup> targeted kinetochores very efficiently even after the depletion of endogenous Bub1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). We asked if an equivalent GFP reporter construct encompassing the B3BD of BubR1, BubR1<sup>362\u2013431</sup>, was also recruited to kinetochores. BubR1<sup>362\u2013431</sup> was not recruited to kinetochores even in the presence of Bub1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>. Diagrams of Bub1 and BubR1 deletions used in this study are in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). Thus, even if Bub1 and BubR1 share a related B3BD to interact with the same kinetochore-targeting subunit (Bub3) and interact in a phosphorylation-dependent manner with Knl1, the mechanisms of their kinetochore recruitment are different. This raises two crucial questions: (1) why is the B3BD region of Bub1 sufficient for kinetochore recruitment, while the equivalent region of BubR1 is not? And (2) if binding to Bub3 is not sufficient for robust kinetochore recruitment of BubR1, how is BubR1 recruited to kinetochores? We will focus sequentially on these questions."

Conversely, GFP-Bub1<sup>209\u2013270</sup> did not interact with BubR1, in agreement with the inability of this construct to promote BubR1 localization. In this context, it should be noted that the tetratrico peptide repeats (TPRs) near the N-terminus of Bub1 and BubR1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) had been initially identified as primary determinants of kinetochore recruitment (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kiyomitsu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bolanos-Garcia et al., 2011</a>), but later shown to be dispensable (<a href=\"#bib27\">Krenn et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2014</a>), a result confirmed here. In our IP experiments, however, we observe that Bub1 interacts with the outer kinetochore more strongly when the TPRs are present, in agreement with our previous studies (<a href=\"#bib27\">Krenn et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2014</a>). The Bub1 TPR region interacts with a short sequence motif of Knl1 named KI1 motif (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kiyomitsu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Krenn et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2014</a>). This interaction, whose precise significance is unclear, enhances the SAC response (<a href=\"#bib26\">Krenn et al., 2014</a>). Additional evidence of a modest additional role of the TPR in the interaction of Bub1 and BubR1 with kinetochores is presented in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>."

In these experiments in vitro, BubR1<sup>1\u2013571</sup> did not require Bub3 to bind Bub1<sup>1\u2013409</sup>/Bub3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>), and therefore in the following SEC experiments, we used BubR1 and BubR1/Bub3 interchangeably (whereas Bub1 was poorly expressed and largely insoluble in insect cells without Bub3). Although this result may suggest that Bub3 is not required for the interaction of BubR1 with Bub1/Bub3, we show and discuss in the context of Figure 6 that a functional B3BD is required for the interaction of BubR1 with Bub1 in living cells."

Thus, Bub3 binding is necessary for efficient kinetochore localization of BubR1 even if it may appear to be dispensable for the interaction in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). We note that in those SEC binding experiments in vitro in which we used isolated BubR1 rather than BubR1/Bub3, Bub3 might have exchanged from the Bub1/Bub3 complex to reconstitute BubR1/Bub3. Alternatively, the relatively high protein concentrations in the SEC experiments (5\u201315 \u00b5M) may effectively compensate for reduced binding affinity when BubR1 is devoid of Bub3."

This requirement may reflect a direct contribution to the interaction with Bub1 or alternatively a residual ability of BubR1/Bub3 to bind phosphorylated motifs on Knl1 or other kinetochore proteins. To try distinguishing between these possibilities, we targeted a Lac repressor (LacI) fusion of Bub1 to an ectopic Lac operator (LacO) site on the chromosome distinct from centromeres. LacI-Bub1 recruited BubR1 to the ectopic site (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013H</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), thus suggesting that kinetochores are not required for the Bub1/BubR1 interaction, in agreement with a previous study in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rischitor et al., 2006</a>). This result suggests that Bub1/Bub3 is sufficient for recruitment of BubR1/Bub3, and that the role of Bub3 in recruitment of BubR1 might be direct and not through Knl1. Mutation of the Bub3-binding site of the LacI-Bub1 fusion (Bub1<sup>E252K</sup>) prevented BubR1 recruitment, suggesting that Bub3 is required for a robust interaction between Bub1 and BubR1 on both sides of the complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013H</a>)."

The occurrence of nine distinct duplications of the Bub1 and BubR1 ancestor (<a href=\"#bib56\">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012a</a>) likely reflects an extreme evolutionary pressure to separate functions that were originally condensed in a single gene.

Here, we have considerably extended our understanding of this divergence by showing that the loop motifs in the B3BDs of Bub1 and BubR1 modulate the interaction of Bub3 with MELT<sup>P</sup>. A suboptimal loop region for MELT<sup>P</sup> binding in BubR1 makes it depend on an alternative mechanism for kinetochore localization. This alternative is the direct interaction with Bub1, extensively characterized in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4\u20136</a>. By swapping loop motifs, we created a gain-of-function mutant of BubR1 that can bind kinetochores in the absence of Bub1, and a loss-of-function mutant of Bub1 severely impaired in autonomous kinetochore binding. The failure of the BubR1 gain-of-function mutant to complement the depletion of wild-type BubR1 strongly suggests that the evolutionary divergence of Bub1 and BubR1, with its specific effects on kinetochore recruitment, is functionally relevant."

It involves equivalent segments of Bub1 and BubR1 comprising their B3BD/GLEBS motif and a CTE whose first part is predicted to be helical. The interaction of Bub1 and BubR1 requires that each has a bound Bub3. Thus, Bub3 has at least three distinct functions: (1) it recruits Bub1 to MELT<sup>P</sup> motifs of Knl1; (2) it contributes to the dimerization of Bub1 with BubR1 required for kinetochore recruitment of the latter; and (3) in complex with BubR1, it has an additional hitherto unknown function in the SAC. This function was exposed by the behavior of the BubR1<sup>E409K+E413K</sup> mutant. The SAC defect observed with this mutant is unlikely to be a consequence of impaired kinetochore localization, because another kinetochore-localization impaired mutant, BubR1<sup>\u0394432\u2013484</sup>, was checkpoint proficient. We surmise that BubR1-bound Bub3 is involved in an unknown aspect of the SAC mechanism downstream of kinetochores, possibly having to do with MCC formation or APC/C binding, as recently proposed (<a href=\"#bib15\">Han et al., 2014</a>). In analogy with the role of the Bub1 loop motif in modulating the function of Bub3 as a MELT<sup>P</sup> receptor, we speculate that the BubR1 loop motif influences the specificity of BubR1-bound Bub3 for additional SAC-relevant targets. The fact that the \u2018loop swap\u2019 BubR1 mutant is unable to sustain the SAC provides evidence for this hypothesis.

To create N-terminally-tagged EGFP Bub1 and BubR1 truncation constructs, Bub1 and BubR1 sequences were obtained by PCR amplification from the previously generated pCDNA5/FRT/TO-EGFP-Bub1-IRES and pCDNA5/FRT/TO-EGFP-BubR1-IRES vector, respectively (<a href=\"#bib27\">Krenn et al., 2012</a>) and subcloned in frame with the GFP-tag. Mutations and deletions within the Bub1 and BubR1 constructs were generated by standard site-directed mutagenesis or by a mutagenesis protocol (<a href=\"#bib33\">Liu and Naismith, 2008</a>). All Bub1 constructs were RNAi resistant (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kiyomitsu et al., 2007</a>). BubR1-expressing constructs were made siRNA-resistant by changing the sequence targeted by the RNAi oligos to \u2018AACGTGCCTTCGAGTACGAGA\u2019. pCDNA5/FRT/TO-based plasmids were used for generation of stable cell lines, as well as for transient transfection.

Previous efforts to distinguish the functions of Bub1 and BubR1, two closely related proteins, have yielded confusing results. Overlack and co-workers have carried out a series of well-designed experiments that lead to a plausible model for the function of these proteins in dividing cells. In this model, Bub1 binds Bub3 to form a complex that recruits the BubR1/Bub3 complex. By examining dissecting kinetochore recruitment of BubR1, the authors propose that its kinetochore recruitment may not be critical for its checkpoint function but rather for establishing proper chromosome-microtubule attachments."

We speculate that such behavior reflects a cooperative binding mechanism that is strongly weakened upon cell lysis and solubilization of kinetochores, possibly as a consequence of dephosphorylation of the relevant receptor. Indeed, we did not identify Mad1 in the IPs. However, an interaction of Mad1 with Bub1 was reported for <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>C. elegans</i>, and in addition we recently reported that Mad1 can be identified in IPs of the first MELT region of Knl1, and that Bub1 is also present in such IPs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Krenn et al. 2014</a>).

Because we show that full length BubR1 carrying the loop swap mutation is recruited to kinetochores in a Bub1-independent manner in the presence of endogenous Knl1, and that full length Bub1 carrying the loop swap mutation cannot be recruited to Knl1 any longer, our experiments with MELT1 in vitro clearly support a general behavior, not one that is limited to MELT1."

It was important to discuss the behavior of this mutant, as well as its possible interpretations. We have tried to improve the discussion of this mutant, which, we realize, is complex, as it entails the interaction with PP2A, the possibility that the deletion removes an important regulatory intramolecular interaction, etc. With this word of caution, the work carries a whole lot of new, surprising, and very relevant functional data, the most relevant of which is that it allows for the first time to understand how Bub1 and BubR1 are recruited to kinetochores. We also demonstrate that the \u201cloop\u201d regions of Bub1 and BubR1 impart very different behaviors to Bub3, and that they cannot be replaced without fundamentally altering the functions of these proteins, a quite striking manifestation of sub-functionalization. We show that Bub1 and BubR1 interact directly. And we demonstrate that kinetochore-microtubule attachment is crucially dependent on kinetochore localization of BubR1. The latter is not a novel conclusion, but it is obtained here with a \u201cseparation of function\u201d mutant of BubR1 that is checkpoint proficient. For all these reasons, we think that this paper will be greatly influential."
