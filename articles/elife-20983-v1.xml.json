While excavating a Byzantine cemetery in Troy, we discovered calcified abscesses among a woman\u2019s remains. Scanning electron microscopy of the tissue revealed \u2018ghost cells\u2019, resulting from dystrophic calcification, which preserved ancient maternal, fetal and bacterial DNA of a severe infection, likely chorioamnionitis. <i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i> and <i>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</i> dominated the abscesses. Phylogenomic analyses of ancient, historical, and contemporary data showed that <i>G. vaginalis</i> Troy fell within contemporary genetic diversity, whereas <i>S. saprophyticus</i> Troy belongs to a lineage that does not appear to be commonly associated with human disease today. We speculate that the ecology of <i>S. saprophyticus</i> infection may have differed in the ancient world as a result of close contacts between humans and domesticated animals. These results highlight the complex and dynamic interactions with our microbial milieu that underlie severe maternal infections."

While excavating a Byzantine cemetery in Troy, we discovered calcified abscesses among a woman\u2019s remains. Scanning electron microscopy of the tissue revealed \u2018ghost cells\u2019, resulting from dystrophic calcification, which preserved ancient maternal, fetal and bacterial DNA of a severe infection, likely chorioamnionitis. <i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i> and <i>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</i> dominated the abscesses. Phylogenomic analyses of ancient, historical, and contemporary data showed that <i>G. vaginalis</i> Troy fell within contemporary genetic diversity, whereas <i>S. saprophyticus</i> Troy belongs to a lineage that does not appear to be commonly associated with human disease today. We speculate that the ecology of <i>S. saprophyticus</i> infection may have differed in the ancient world as a result of close contacts between humans and domesticated animals. These results highlight the complex and dynamic interactions with our microbial milieu that underlie severe maternal infections."

Some of the woman\u2019s tissues had been well preserved because they had calcified (probably as the result of infection), which preserved their structure in a mineralized layer. Two mineralized \u201cnodules\u201d in the body appear to be the remains of abscesses. Some of the human DNA in the nodules came from a male, suggesting that the woman was pregnant with a boy and that the abscesses formed in placental tissue."

One species, called <i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i>, is found in modern pregnancy-related infections. The DNA of the ancient samples was similar to that of modern bacteria. The other bacteria species was an ancient form of <i>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</i>, a type of bacteria that causes urinary tract infections. However, the DNA of the ancient <i>S. saprophyticus</i> bacteria is quite different to that of the bacteria found in modern humans. Instead, their DNA sequence appears more similar to forms of the bacteria that infect currently livestock. As humans lived closely with their livestock at the time the woman lived, her infection may be due to a type of bacteria that passed easily between humans and animals."

To exclude an exogenous environmental source of the bacterial DNA and to further investigate the tissue of origin, we performed metagenomic profiling of the nodules, ulna and sediment from the gravesite. The similarity in abundance of <i>G. vaginalis</i> in the nodules and modern Human Microbiome Panel (HMP) vaginal samples (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>) points to a likely origin for the nodules in the female reproductive tract. The metagenomic profile of the nodules (minus their associated blanks) is distinct from the sediment, whereas the reads from the ulna group closely with the sediment sample (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>). These results indicate that the nodules were less prone to leaching of environmental DNA. Our SEM-EDS and XRD findings suggest that bacterial and inflammatory cells were replicated in calcium phosphate minerals (\u2018ghost cells\u2019); it is likely that this mineralization provided a remarkable degree of protection from DNA degradation and environmental leaching as seen in the bones. The ectopic, inflammation-related calcification observed here is an apparently highly effective mechanism of bacterial fossilization that rivals mineralization occurring at much slower rates in the environment."

They were performed as follows. For Set A (<a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 1J</a>), multiple consecutive rounds of DM (with 0.5M EDTA) and digestion were performed on a shaker (1000 rpm), with the supernatant(s) from each round subjected to organic extraction and filtration.

All pools except Nod1_all (pool \u2018K\u2019) were size-selected using an electrophoresis gel size selection procedure (retaining molecules\u00a0~125/150/150 to 500 bp in length) in order to exclude as much no-insert adaptimer (and other short adapter artifacts) as possible. Pool \u2018F\u2019 also contained 10 additional samples not considered in this paper (pooled at a ratio of \u20181\u2019). Pools were sequenced across three paired-end runs on the HiSeq 1500, all alongside other, unrelated samples: Pool \u2018K\u2019 (80 bp final read length), Pool \u2018F\u2019 (85 bp final read length), and pools \u2018G'-'J\u2019 (90 bp final read length). On the last run, the enrichment round 1 and 2 samples (pools \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018J\u2019) were separated on two different lanes, since they have the same index sequences."

We made an additional attempt to date organic residues from demineralized nodule one, using base treatment (0.1N NaOH) to remove possible soil carbon contamination. This resulted in a very old date of 4680 yr BP, possibly due to the presence of residual refractory soil carbon (humin). Given these discrepant ages, the results for the nodules must be viewed with caution, in contrast to that of the bone."

Melanosomes, which are commonly fossilized in association with colored structures such as feathers (<a href=\"#bib127\">Vinther et al., 2008</a>), were originally mistaken for fossilized bacteria (<a href=\"#bib138\">Wuttke, 1983</a>), an interpretation that persists in some cases (<a href=\"#bib88\">Moyer et al., 2014</a>), but melanin, in contrast to bacteria, is very resistant to degradation (<a href=\"#bib128\">Vinther, 2016</a>). Soft tissue fossilization relies on microbial activity to release mineral-forming ions and establish geochemical gradients, and microbial films (biofilms) may control diffusion (<a href=\"#bib14\">Briggs, 2003a</a>). Biofilms, which are composed of spatially organized bacterial cells attached to a common surface and embedded within a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS - a glycocalyx secreted by the cells), rarely preserve cellular details, but individual microbial morphologies, such as coccoids, may become mineralized (<a href=\"#bib15\">Briggs, 2003b</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Briggs et al., 1997</a>)."

We interpret the coccoid structures evident in the images (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, red arrows) as the superficially mineralized remains of bacteria. The rounded shape and clustering (without chain formation) are typical of <i>Staphylococci</i>, which measure between 0.5 and 1.0 microns in diameter. The size of the cocci in the electron micrographs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) vary between 0.5 to 3.5 microns; the range in size may represent cells with varying degrees of biomineralization (i.e. precipitation of apatite and carbonate on the cell wall) thereby increasing their overall dimensions. The structures in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> (yellow arrows) have an appearance typical of EPS, suggesting that the <i>Staphylococci</i> were organized into a biofilm during active infection. Given the likely origin of the nodules studied here (see below), the presence of biofilms is not surprising. Biofilms are commonly associated with chronic infections and have been found in many tissues, including within the amniotic cavity (<a href=\"#bib105\">Romero et al., 2008</a>). Larger irregular structures (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, blue arrows) more than five microns in size, are likely to represent neutrophils, which would be expected at the site of an active infection.

By contrast, paleodemographic data implicate pregnancy complications as the leading cause of death among women in the Late Byzantine world (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bourbou, 2010</a>).

Elemental analyses of the nodules were not, however, typical of either infection-related (i.e. struvite) or other types of urinary stone. The abundance of human DNA in the nodules also argues for their origin in human tissue, as opposed to inorganic stone material with entrapped human cells.

The median for reads (&gt;35 bp, Q<sub>m</sub>\u00a0=\u00a030) mapping to the X, Y and autosomes were 45, 44 and 45 bp respectively and thus nearly identical suggesting that they stem from the same pool of damaged human endogenous DNAs found within the abscess. The damage profiles for these same reads, restricted to the two non-UDG treated shotgun libraries) clearly shows damage in those mapping to the X and the autosomes. While there is more noise in the Y, due to overall fewer reads present, they still have a decided increase in C to T and G to A transitions at terminal positions, again suggestive of their authenticity (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). We used a Fisher\u2019s exact test to assess whether the number of unique reads mapping to the Y chromosome was significantly greater in the nodule than the ulna or sediment samples, despite unequal sequencing depths (893/33262468 nodule vs 3/4558127 bone). We found the nodule to have significantly more Y-mapped reads than either the ulna and sediment samples (p&lt;2.2E-16 for both tests). There was no significant difference in the proportion of Y-mapped reads between the ulna and sediment samples. We attempted to sex the remains (i.e calcified nodules, ulna and their associated blanks as well as the surrounding sediments and blanks) using the method developed and published by <a href=\"#bib114\">Skoglund et al. (2013)</a>. Our input consisted of all reads\u00a0&gt;35 bp, mapping to the hard masked version of hg38 with map quality\u00a0&gt;30. As can be seen (<a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>) all libraries derived from nodule DNA extractions are consistently assigned as female (XX). It is worth noting that in addition to this assignment (XX), all libraries also show the consistent presence of Y reads. The sediment has no assigned sex and the ulna is \u2018consistent with XX\u2019 but read numbers are low (n\u00a0=\u00a022). Importantly, blanks, also with low read counts (n\u00a0=\u00a01\u201335) are labelled as \u2018consistent with XX\u2019 with 95% confidence intervals (at those levels) of 0. Considering (a) that the skeleton is biologically female and of child-bearing age, (b) that the nodule and ulna share the same mtDNA haplotype, and (c) the relative abundance of X chromosome reads in both nodules, we interpret the significantly higher Y-mapped reads in the nodule over the ulna as evidence to support that the human DNA recovered from the nodule originated from that of two individuals, a female and her male fetus."

The duplicated region precluded straightforward iterative or <i>de novo</i> assembly due to challenges in resolving which version was found in the same location as the reference and which version was found in the novel region. The challenges arose from the partially conserved, partially highly divergent nature of the duplicated region (which is problematic for both reference-guided and <i>de novo</i> assembly) as well as the short reads precluding the spanning of SNPs (haplotypes) by long paired-end reads. Proper gene sequences were established via a combination of (a) manually working inwards from the shared flanking regions with liberal assembly to manually determine correct sequence and (b) iterative assembly to <i>de novo</i> reconstruct highly divergent sections. For the majority of positions, the ancient versions of SSP0354-56 do match the reference genome and the novel copies are the 'unmatching' positions; however, in several instances, the reads support that the 'reference matching' positions are in fact on the paralogous copies instead of the homologous ancient SSP0354-56 genes.

The iterative assembly process established the presence of at least the same number of bordering RNA regions as in the reference sequence, although it cannot be determined whether there is any rearrangement of the intervening regions in the Troy strain versus the reference."

This claim is made with a single cattle isolate that falls basal to the strain identified in Troy; however, other animal isolates fall within the tree.

The Y chromosome damage patterns presented in the supplementary information are not sufficiently robust (due to the limited number of reads) to determine if the DNA is ancient. The number of nuclear genome SNP sites covered by one or more reads in both the ulna and the nodule is likely insufficient for an assessment of relatedness.

The authors interpret this result as evidence that the nodule and the ulna come from the same individual. Of course, the authors elsewhere in the manuscript suggest a placental origin for the nodules, via chorioamnionitis with a male fetus. This underscores the inability for mtDNA to facilitate confident individual identifications, since it is inherited maternally without recombination. Thus, the authors should be more circumspect in their identification based on this evidence. If this is DNA from a male fetus, then all evidence is indeed pointing to an association with the female whose skeletal remains were recovered, but please ensure precision when discussing this evidence."

This claim is made with a single cattle isolate that falls basal to the strain identified in Troy; however, other animal isolates fall within the tree. In the absence of additional cattle strains and wider sampling in general, the results should be treated with appropriate caution and interpretations tempered. Divergence date estimates generated with the field's current gold standard (BEAST) should be provided in the main text. If these estimates cannot be obtained for a technical reason or limitation then this needs to be clarified in the main text, not only the supplementary information.</i> "

Human mtDNA genome sequences obtained from both the nodule and from aDNA extracted from the individual's ulna were identical. The authors interpret this result as evidence that the nodule and the ulna come from the same individual. Of course, the authors elsewhere in the manuscript suggest a placental origin for the nodules, via chorioamnionitis with a male fetus. This underscores the inability for mtDNA to facilitate confident individual identifications, since it is inherited maternally without recombination. Thus, the authors should be more circumspect in their identification based on this evidence. If this is DNA from a male fetus, then all evidence is indeed pointing to an association with the female whose skeletal remains were recovered, but please ensure precision when discussing this evidence.</i> "
