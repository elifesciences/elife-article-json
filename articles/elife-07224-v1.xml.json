Population measures found these fluctuations to organize as scale-invariant neuronal avalanches, suggesting cortical dynamics to be critical. Macroscopic dynamics, though, depend on physiological states and are ambiguous as to their cellular composition, spatiotemporal origin, and contributions from synaptic input or action potential (AP) output. Here, we study spontaneous firing in pyramidal neurons (PNs) from rat superficial cortical layers in vivo and in vitro using 2-photon imaging. As the animal transitions from the anesthetized to awake state, spontaneous single neuron firing increases in irregularity and assembles into scale-invariant avalanches at the group level. In vitro spike avalanches emerged naturally yet required balanced excitation and inhibition. This demonstrates that neuronal avalanches are linked to the global physiological state of wakefulness and that cortical resting activity organizes as avalanches from firing of local PN groups to global population activity."

On a large scale, when monitoring many thousands of neurons, resting activity in the cortex demonstrates propagation in the brain in an organized manner. Specifically, resting activity was found to organize as so-called neuronal avalanches, in which large bursts of neuronal activity are grouped with medium-sized and smaller bursts in a very characteristic order. In fact, the sizes of these bursts\u2014that is, the number of neurons that fire\u2014are found to be scale-invariant, that is, the ratio of large bursts to medium-sized bursts is the same as that of medium-sized to small bursts. Such scale-invariance suggests that neuronal bursts are not independent of one another. However, it is largely unclear how neuronal avalanches arise from individual neurons, which fire simply in a noisy, irregular manner."

As the animals awaken, the firing of individual pyramidal cells in the cortex becomes even more irregular than under anesthesia. However, by considering the activity of a group of these neurons, Bellay, Klaus et al. realized that it is this more irregular firing that gives rise to neuronal avalanches, and that this occurs only when the animals are awake. Further experiments on individual pyramidal cells grown in the laboratory confirmed that neuronal avalanches emerge spontaneously from the irregular firing of individual neurons. These avalanches depend on there being a balance between two types of activity among the cells: \u2018excitatory\u2019 activity that causes other neurons to fire, and \u2018inhibitory\u2019 activity that prevents neuronal firing."

Neuronal avalanches identify a specific organization of activity patterns in which avalanche sizes distribute according to a power law with slope of \u22121.5, that is, the relative occurrences of avalanche sizes are constant (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</a>). This scale-invariant organization, which transcends many spatial and temporal scales, is an indication that cortical dynamics reside at or close to a critical state in which interactions between local elements give rise to long-range spatial and long-term temporal fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib77\">Plenz and Thiagarajan, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chialvo, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Beggs and Timme, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Plenz, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Markovi\u0107 and Gros, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Plenz and Niebur, 2014</a>).

However, it is currently not known how the scale-invariant, macroscopic organization of avalanches measured at the population level relates to the output of the principal cells of cortex, that is, AP firing in pyramidal neurons (PNs) and how this organization relates to the global physiological state of the animal. AP firing in PNs is commonly reported as spontaneous and irregular (<a href=\"#bib99\">Softky and Koch, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>) with low average correlation in firing between neurons during spontaneous activity and a high variability in evoked AP responses (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gawne and Richmond, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kerr et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Sato et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Poulet and Petersen, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ecker et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Komiyama et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Renart et al., 2010</a>). Here, we show experimentally in vivo that ongoing fluctuations in AP firing in single cortical neurons amount to scale-invariant AP avalanches at the neuronal group level. The emergence of spike avalanches marks the AW state and is absent under anesthesia. Similarly, spike avalanches spontaneously organize in layer 2/3 PN groups from organotypic slice cultures and yet are sensitive to the E/I balance. We propose that critical dynamics govern the organization of resting activity in the awake animal from AP firing in individual PNs to the activity in large neuronal groups across cortex."

Labeled mature neurons distributed throughout dorsolateral frontal and sensorimotor cortex. They exhibited PN morphology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and their synaptic transmission was blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists (data not shown). To record ongoing AP activity in local PN groups, we performed 2-photon imaging (2-PI) of YC2.60-expressing PNs in head-restrained rats (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>; depth = 270 \u00b1 50 \u00b5m; cortical area = 0.15 \u00b1 0.05 mm<sup>2</sup>; 10\u201315 min per recording). Recordings were done under anesthesia (AN; 1\u20132% isoflurane), during wakening (WK; 5\u201320 min at 0% isoflurane), and in the awake state (AW; after &gt;20 min at 0% isoflurane). Intracellular calcium transients produced fluorescence changes in visually identified somatic ROIs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), which were converted into ratiometric time courses (\u0394R/R) and then deconvolved to obtain an instantaneous firing rate estimate, \u03bb, for each neuron (<a href=\"#bib115\">Vogelstein et al., 2010</a>) (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). In control experiments, we showed (1) YC2.60 reliably and linearly reported AP activity at physiological temperature from single APs to AP bursts up to 28 Hz (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) and (2) \u03bb linearly recovered spike trains at different temporal resolutions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We first recorded at a temporal resolution of \u0394t = 250 ms (n = 6 rats; 38 recordings; 15\u201330 active PNs/recording; &gt;1 AP/min). Neuronal activity was stationary in \u03bb and in the average crosscorrelation, R, between ROIs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>, respectively). Neurons fired on average more during AW compared to WK and AN (ANOVA, F(2,35) = 23.05, p &lt; 0.001; probability density function (PDF) shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Under all three conditions, though, neurons fired irregular APs interspaced by relatively long periods of quiescence. This was quantified by three measures. First, \u03bb distributed exponentially for single neurons [log-likelihood ratio (LLR) comparison between power law vs exponential, &gt;98% of ROIs in favor of exponential distribution, p &lt; 0.05; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, single distributions and average for one PN group; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, averages over all PN groups]. Second, neurons tended to not fire at all within \u0394t (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <i>left</i>; <i>arrow</i>). The corresponding probability of quiescence, P<sub>q</sub> (\u03bb &lt; minimal \u03bb threshold, \u03bb<sub>thr</sub>, set to 0.5), was highest for AN and WK (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <i>inset</i>; ANOVA, F(2,35) = 23.05, p = 0.002). Both of these characteristics remained true for higher temporal resolutions despite the expected increase in \u03bb fluctuations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <i>right</i>; additional n = 6 rats; n = 19 recordings; \u0394t = 167 and 88 ms during AW; LLR in favor of exponential, p &lt; 0.05) and P<sub>q</sub> (ANOVA, F(2,28) = 31.46, p &lt; 0.001). Third, the normalized duration of quiescent times, IBI<sub>norm</sub>, between firing (i.e., \u03bb &lt; \u03bb<sub>thr</sub> = 0.5) also distributed exponentially for all conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <i>right</i>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; LLR: &gt;98% of ROIs with p &lt; 0.05). The corresponding CV was larger than 1 for all conditions, was significantly higher for AW than WK and AN (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <i>left</i>; <i>inset</i>, AW: 1.5 \u00b1 0.2; WK: 1.2 \u00b1 0.1; AN: 1.2 \u00b1 0.1; mean \u00b1 SD, F(2,35) = 25.66, p &lt; 0.001), and increased further with temporal resolution (AW, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <i>right</i>; \u0394t = 167 ms, 1.9 \u00b1 0.4; \u0394t = 88 ms, 2.1 \u00b1 0.3, mean \u00b1 SD; F(2,28) = 15.48, p &lt; 0.001). This irregularity was also robust to minimal AP activity: increasing \u03bb<sub>thr</sub> smoothly reduced the average firing rate \u03bb<sub>avg</sub> (data not shown), yet maintained a CV larger than 1 for all conditions and \u0394t (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Previous work on the AW resting state revealed temporal AP clustering during large intracellular membrane potential fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib79\">Poulet and Petersen, 2008</a>) and spatial clustering of AP firing for L2/3 PNs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Greenberg et al., 2008</a>) similar to the correlation profile found during tasks (<a href=\"#bib42\">Komiyama et al., 2010</a>).

                                "text": "In the preceding section, we quantified how irregular spontaneous firing in individual PNs and their pairwise correlations change as the animal transitions from the AN to the AW state. None of these measures, though, allows us to identify neuronal avalanches, which reflect a scale-invariant relationship of neuronal group activities. In fact, we recently demonstrated that event rate and pairwise correlation R are insufficient to predict neuronal avalanches in cortical activity (<a href=\"#bib122\">Yu et al., 2011</a>). In a first approach, we therefore identified spatiotemporal activity clusters in the neuronal population. This was done by concatenating firing events of neurons that co-occurred either within \u0394t or within consecutive periods of \u0394t (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <i>gray areas</i>) and separating clusters by quiescent periods of at least \u0394t, the original approach to identify avalanche dynamics (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</a>). For a given neuronal population and 2-PI, this process has two free parameters: (1) the temporal resolution \u0394t, which is fixed by the scanning frame rate of 2-PI and (2) the activity threshold, \u03bb<sub>thr</sub>, of a firing event. In general, if \u03bb<sub>thr</sub> is low, most firing events will be concatenated into few large clusters. Similarly, if \u03bb<sub>thr</sub> is high, the few remaining firing events will group into few clusters. Thus, a maximal number of clusters is expected at an intermediate threshold <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mo>\u2009\u2009</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03bb</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>r</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>. We first studied this relationship in the AW state. Indeed, for a given recording at \u0394t, the cluster rate increased with \u03bb<sub>thr</sub> and was maximal at an intermediate threshold <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><mo>\u2009\u2009</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03bb</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>r</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <i>arrows</i>). As expected, <math id=\"inf3\"><mrow><mo>\u2009\u2009</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03bb</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>r</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> shifted towards smaller \u03bb<sub>thr</sub> values at higher temporal resolutions due to the improved resolution of fast \u03bb fluctuations. Next, we studied the cluster size <i>s</i>, that is, the sum of all firing events within a cluster normalized by the predicted cluster size limit \u039b, which is determined by the number of ROIs and their respective average firing rate (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). If the activity of neurons was rather independent from each other, as one might assume from the low average pairwise correlation in \u03bb (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the distribution in cluster size should be close to an exponential function. On the other hand, if interactions between neurons contribute significantly to spontaneous firing, then the cluster size distribution deviates from an exponential function, and, in the case of avalanche dynamics, should follow a power law (<a href=\"#bib77\">Plenz and Thiagarajan, 2007</a>).

Importantly, for critical avalanche dynamics and negligible finite-size effects, the temporal resolution for which the power-law exponent, \u03b1, is \u22121.5 yields a branching ratio, \u03c3, close to 1. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, a similar relationship between \u03b1 and \u03c3 was also found empirically for AP avalanches in vivo. Furthermore, the temporal organization of neuronal avalanches, that is, the avalanche life time, was shown to distribute according to a power law with exponent close to \u22122 (experimentally: [<a href=\"#bib4\">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</a>]; simulations and theory: [<a href=\"#bib33\">Harris, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Eurich et al., 2002</a>]). Similarly, we found that the cluster lifetime, <i>T</i>, distributed according to a power law with slope close to \u22122 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; \u0394t = 250 ms, slope \u03b3 = 1.7 \u00b1 0.1; \u0394t = 167 ms, \u03b3 = 1.9 \u00b1 0.2; \u0394t = 88 ms, \u03b3 = 2.2 \u00b1 0.2, LLR = 100.4\u2013344.1; p &lt; 0.001).

This cut-off was more pronounced at lower temporal resolutions and higher thresholds as shown previously for LFP-based avalanches (<a href=\"#bib121\">Yu et al., 2014</a>). The threshold robustness and cut-off are in line with previous reports on avalanche dynamics in vitro (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</a>) and in non-human primates (<a href=\"#bib73\">Petermann et al., 2009</a>) and humans (<a href=\"#bib98\">Shriki et al., 2013</a>)."

                                "text": "LFP recordings in cortex slice cultures (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Stewart and Plenz, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gireesh and Plenz, 2008</a>) have shown avalanche dynamics to emerge spontaneously in superficial layers. Similarly, spike avalanches have been identified in extracellular unit recordings from dissociated cultures of hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib59\">Mazzoni et al., 2007</a>) and cortex (<a href=\"#bib72\">Pasquale et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Tetzlaff et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib114\">Vincent et al., 2012</a>), although the mesoscopic organization of the tissue was not preserved. Yet, these studies are limited by the unknown composition of the LFP population signal (see \u2018Introduction\u2019) and cell types recorded from. For extracellular unit activity, strongly bursting interneurons can dominate large spike clusters in the neuronal population, in which case heavy-tailed cluster size distributions reflect neuronal differences rather than neuronal interactions. In order to demonstrate that avalanche dynamics also capture spatiotemporal activity in L2/3 PNs in vitro, we conducted studies in GECI-expressing cortical slices, co-cultured with VTA to ensure proper maturation of superficial cortical layers (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gireesh and Plenz, 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a>). We recorded AP activity from local groups of L2/3 PNs in vitro (n = 15\u201380 ROIs) monitored with YC2.60 (\u0394t = 250 ms; n = 129 movies, n = 35 cultures; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>) and compared the activity to conditions when GABA<sub>A</sub> (5 \u00b5M PTX, n = 8) or AMPA and NMDA-receptor mediated (0.5 \u00b5M DNQX, 5 \u00b5M AP5, n = 6) synaptic transmission were slightly reduced. Neuronal activity was stable throughout the recording for each condition (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). At the single neuron level, AP firing was irregular, in line with our in vivo results (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Temporal clustering was present under normal conditions (ACSF) but was reduced during disinhibition or disfacilitation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>, PTX and DNQX/AP5, respectively). An intermediate level in correlated AP firing was found under normal conditions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). Correlations between neighboring and distant neurons were highly similar and as expected increased during disinhibition but decreased during disfacilitation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). As described in our in vivo results, the mean rate smoothly declined with increase in \u03bb<sub>thr</sub> (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), and the number of AP cascades of PN groups peaked in rate at an intermediate threshold \u03bb<sub>thr</sub> (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>) for all three conditions. When processed at the corresponding <math id=\"inf11\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03bb</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>r</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>, cascade sizes under normal conditions distributed according to a power law that was robust to changes in \u03bb<sub>thr</sub> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I</a>, <i>left</i>). As expected, the power law was destroyed when spiking activity was shuffled (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I</a>, <i>right</i>). As previously shown for LFP-based analysis (<a href=\"#bib74\">Plenz, 2012</a>), AP-based cluster size distributions became strongly bimodal during pharmacological disinhibition and slightly bimodal during disfacilitation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>, PTX and DNQX/AP5, respectively; <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). YC2.60, while being sensitive to single APs, tends to saturate for very strong spike bursts (<a href=\"#bib119\">Yamada et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, the GECI GCaMP3 (<a href=\"#bib109\">Tian et al., 2009</a>) naturally has a higher threshold for AP detection (&gt;3 APs) but reports even strong bursts linearly (<a href=\"#bib119\">Yamada et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). In line with our expectation of threshold invariance for LFP-based avalanches in the AW monkey (<a href=\"#bib73\">Petermann et al., 2009</a>) and our YC2.60 measurements, we found that AP bursts measured with GCaMP3 were irregular at the single neuron level (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3C\u2013H</a>), while AP cascades formed a clear power law (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3I,J</a>; n = 9 cultures). These in vitro results demonstrate neuronal avalanches to describe the spatiotemporal spike activity in L2/3 PN groups, that is, sensitive to the balance of excitation and inhibition and can be detected using high-threshold GECIs."

In vivo, the emergence of avalanche organization in local pyramidal groups is linked to the AW state and is abolished under anesthesia. In vitro, this emergence occurs naturally and yet is sensitive to the balance of excitation and inhibition. To date, avalanche dynamics have been demonstrated in numerous population signals, such as the LFP, EEG, MEG, and BOLD fMRI. These population signals, however, are ambiguous as to their site of origin, their emergence from non-neuronal or neuronal elements, and their sensitivity to subthreshold and suprathreshold neuronal activities. Such ambiguities put into question whether computational benefits attributed to avalanche dynamics, or critical state dynamics in general (<a href=\"#bib95\">Shew and Plenz, 2012</a>), extend to the local cortical microcircuit with computations taking place between PNs and local interneurons. Our results provide the first essential step in answering these functional questions at the local microcircuit level by demonstrating that, in the awake animal, local groups of PNs in layer 2/3 spontaneously exhibit highly variable AP clusters that organize as neuronal avalanches. By restricting our analysis to PNs, we avoid inflation of spike cluster from strongly firing interneurons and focus on the local output of a cortical microcircuit. The sensitivity of AP avalanches to anesthesia and the E/I balance demonstrates that PNs as well as interneurons are required to establish these dynamics. In light of the methodological and conceptual complexity of the current work, in what follows, we will first discuss methodological and technical aspects of our experimental design and avalanche analysis followed by a discussion of the concepts of criticality in the context of cortical AP activity at the microcircuit level."

The anti-correlated change at two wavelengths, captured in the ratiometric signal, increases the signal-to-noise ratio and naturally reduces global signal artifacts, such as those caused by movement of the animal. Our cell-attached recordings also demonstrate linear reporting of AP bursts, measured for up to 28 Hz (i.e., 7 APs/250 ms; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This observation suggests that the estimation of AP burst strength in our recordings is only weakly effected by saturation (<a href=\"#bib54\">L\u00fctcke et al., 2010</a>). The lack of impact of any potential saturation effect for YC2.60 on our main results was also demonstrated by our GCaMP3 in vitro recordings. GCaMP3 is relatively insensitive to small AP bursts and does not show saturation for relatively strong bursts, which introduces a natural \u03bb<sub>thr</sub> of \u223c3 APs in our data acquisition (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>).

As demonstrated in awake non-human primates, the amplitude of the negative LFP (nLFP), which identifies local synchronization, monotonically increases with the number of extracellular spikes recorded at the same microelectrode (<a href=\"#bib73\">Petermann et al., 2009</a>). Thus, when identifying nLFPs on the microelectrode array using a threshold, a high threshold includes activity from local neurons that fire strongly, whereas a low threshold also includes weak local neuronal activity. It was found that for LFP-based avalanches, the threshold to identify nLFPs can vary over many standard deviations of the ongoing LFP fluctuations, yet the essential power law in avalanche sizes is maintained, despite a large decline in the nLFP and cascade rates with increase in threshold (<a href=\"#bib73\">Petermann et al., 2009</a>). A similar threshold robustness was found for human avalanche dynamics based on the MEG (<a href=\"#bib98\">Shriki et al., 2013</a>) or BOLD signal in the fMRI signal (<a href=\"#bib106\">Tagliazucchi et al., 2012</a>). This is in line with simulations demonstrating that thresholding does not affect avalanche size distributions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lasse et al., 2009</a>). Threshold independence allows large local events (which are less frequent than small events) to be properly identified for avalanche analysis even at low temporal resolutions. In the current study, by increasing the local firing threshold, we isolated strong, local events in time and space, thus allowing for concatenation of significant local events into avalanches. At higher temporal resolution, the firing threshold can be lower as even small local firing can be properly separated in time (<i>cf</i>. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). As was shown in the original publication on avalanches, at a fixed spatial resolution, prolonging/shortening \u0394t increases/decreases concatenation leading to a systematic change in the power-law slope of avalanches' sizes while maintaining the power-law signature (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</a>). Similarly, the distribution of ROIs within an imaging frame establishes a spatial sampling matrix and correspondingly, the power-law slope was found to change accordingly with change in the frame rate (cf. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

The plane of imaging captured about 25\u201335 labeled PNs within a cortical area of 0.15 \u00b1 0.05 mm<sup>2</sup>. At a neuronal density of \u223c100,000/mm<sup>3</sup> for L2/3 in the adult rat (<a href=\"#bib62\">Meyer et al., 2010</a>), we therefore expect \u223c300 PNs within a focal plane. Thus, we are recording from \u223c10% of PNs within our field of view. Simulations of spike avalanches using a branching process (<a href=\"#bib85\">Ribeiro et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib86\">2014</a>) or models of self-organized criticality (<a href=\"#bib80\">Priesemann et al., 2009</a>) indicate that coarse spatial subsampling affects proper sampling of avalanche size distributions. Previous attempts to identify spike avalanches in the awake monkey found log-normal distributions, despite robust power laws in nLFP-based avalanches (<a href=\"#bib73\">Petermann et al., 2009</a>). Such log-normal distributions have been suggested to indicate slightly subcritical dynamics in spike avalanches (<a href=\"#bib82\">Priesemann et al., 2014</a>). However, our results demonstrate a power law in spike avalanches in the awake, but not anesthetized state, within our imaging frame. Because both states should be affected similarly from subsampling, we conclude that subsampling within our cortical field of view is not a major factor in our recordings to identify the power law in avalanche sizes. This could be because, in the above studies, the sampling density of spikes achieved by microelectrode arrays was orders of magnitudes lower than in the current study. On the other hand, because our cranial window only captured a small region of the cortex, we expect to see a cut-off in the avalanche size distribution, as reported in numerous experimental findings on avalanches based on the nLFP (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Petermann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib121\">Yu et al., 2014</a>) or MEG (<a href=\"#bib98\">Shriki et al., 2013</a>) and simulations (<a href=\"#bib80\">Priesemann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Ribeiro et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Priesemann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Ribeiro et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib121\">Yu et al., 2014</a>).

Our results confirm that indeed single neuron firing is irregular in both the anesthetized and AW state. We found a lower firing rate, less irregularity, and less temporal clustering under anesthesia compared to the AW state. Yet, these differences did not specify any particular organization of the AW state, in particular, given that the average pairwise correlation between PNs did not differ between the two states. This latter finding suggested at first glance no difference in the average neuronal interactions. Only when temporally contingent spatial spike clusters in the neuronal population were taken into account, did the specific scale-invariant avalanche organization of the AW state become evident.

Recent deterministic network models that incorporate synaptic plasticity also demonstrate how such irregularity robustly co-exists with avalanche dynamics, even in the absence of stochasticity (<a href=\"#bib101\">Stepp et al., 2014</a>), yet demonstratively at a phase transition, where the addition of a single spike led to exponentially deviating network trajectories. Several computational studies in non-leaky as well as leaky integrate and fire networks have demonstrated the emergence of spike avalanches at or near a phase transition, where irregular spikes form clusters whose size distributions follow a power law (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Eurich et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Levina et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Millman et al., 2010</a>). Thus, while irregular firing might be ubiquitous in many systems and during different brain states, it is in the AW state where irregularity combines with avalanche dynamics suggestive of a system residing near a phase transition. Our work, by providing detailed parameters on firing rate distributions, event count, interburst statistics, and correlations, should provide new experimental guidance to inform more realistic neuronal network models on critical spiking dynamics."

However, since independent, stationary Poisson processes are insufficient to explain the high variability of spiking (CV &gt; 1) observed typically in vivo (<a href=\"#bib99\">Softky and Koch, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>), alternative mechanisms beyond external Poisson inputs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brunel, 2000</a>) have been proposed to further increase variability, such as intrinsic chaotic dynamics (<a href=\"#bib113\">Van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Sussillo and Abbott, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Ostojic, 2014</a>), conductance-based synapses (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kumar et al., 2008</a>), clustered network architecture (<a href=\"#bib49\">Litwin-Kumar and Doiron, 2012</a>), external synchronous inputs (<a href=\"#bib102\">Stevens and Zador, 1998</a>), and \u2018doubly stochastic\u2019 approaches using non-stationary Poisson processes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Churchland et al., 2010</a>), among others.

However, it was not clear whether avalanches also arise under anesthesia. In fact, avalanche analysis in deeply anesthetized cats or rodents reveals typical deviations, such as unusually shallow power laws based on the LFP and log-normal distributions of extracellular unit clusters (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hahn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Ribeiro et al., 2010</a>). In these latter studies, however, the effect of anesthesia was difficult to separate from technical aspects, such as subsampling, which can affect spike clusters. In the present study, we (1) increased the number of neurons typically recorded with microelectrodes within an area of 200 \u00d7 200 \u00b5m by 1\u20132 orders of magnitude using 2-PI, (2) extracted spike clusters from a well-defined population of PNs, (3) used an exceptionally sensitive GECI to identify even single spikes, and (4) transitioned the animal between the anesthetized and the AW state.

Our results suggest that avalanche dynamics might provide a precise \u2018fingerprint\u2019 to delineate the transition from the anesthetized state to the fully AW state.

The dependency of L2/3 avalanches on a GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonists and glutamate antagonists supports theories that indeed the E/I balance is important to establish avalanche dynamics in cortical networks. Our findings further demonstrate that in isolated cortex, avalanche dynamics is the natural organization that describes PN spiking in the absence of any inputs. Our in vitro recordings resulted in the collection of spike activity over longer periods in time compared to in vivo. This allowed us to demonstrate that GECIs, such as GCaMP3, with a natural threshold for spike burst imaging and which are less prone to saturation can also be used for avalanche detection (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), a direct experimental confirmation of simulations that showed thresholding does not affect avalanche size distributions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lasse et al., 2009</a>). Our in vitro results also provide additional benchmarks to which to compare in vivo avalanche dynamics. For example, pairwise correlations in vitro for avalanche dynamics are significantly higher compared to in vivo. While these values take an intermediate position compared to those found for the disinhibited or disfacilitated state (cf. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>), it is clear that absolute pairwise correlation values do not predict avalanche dynamics.

It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that spike avalanches translate into fast voltage-fluctuations, which in turn generate precise spike outputs, thereby maintaining avalanche dynamics in the cortical microcircuit. Recent findings using voltage-sensitive dyes in layer 2/3 PNs indeed demonstrate neuronal avalanche dynamics to emerge in the AW mouse (<a href=\"#bib92\">Scott et al., 2014</a>). Signals from voltage-sensitive dyes are proportional to the surface-to-volume ratio of the cellular compartment in which the dye is localized, and thus they preferentially report subthreshold intracellular membrane potential fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib75\">Plenz and Aertsen, 1993</a>). This is in contrast to intracellular calcium reporters, which mainly report suprathreshold activity. Our study thus complements reports of neuronal avalanche dynamics in the input to PNs by demonstrating neuronal avalanches in the spike output of PNs in superficial layers in the AW state."

Recent experimental demonstrations of critical slowing down as the membrane potential approaches spike threshold demonstrate critical dynamics to profoundly affect the AP generation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Meisel et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, long-term fluctuations and power-law relationships have been reported for sodium channel gating (<a href=\"#bib110\">Toib et al., 1998</a>).

                                "text": "The identification of avalanches in the main excitatory cell type that constitutes the mammalian cortex establishes the strongest proof to date that avalanche dynamics provide the guiding principles for propagation of cortical activity. This finding should have a number of consequences for a cellular understanding of cortical network activity. First, optimization principles in information processing identified for avalanche dynamics at the population level of cortex should be directly applicable to the interaction of PNs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bertschinger and Natschlager, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kinouchi and Copelli, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">R\u00e4m\u00f6 et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Nykter et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Shew et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">de Arcangelis and Herrmann, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Shew et al., 2011</a>). Specifically, local layer 2/3 networks should exhibit maximal dynamic range to process layer 4 inputs and maximize mutual information between patterns elicited in layer 4 and superficial layers. Second, the nature of spontaneous, irregular firing in PNs profoundly influences theories on cortical function. For example, when these fluctuations in firing are considered to reflect noise, spatiotemporal averaging over neuronal populations can be used to enhance response encoding at the expense of temporal precision and neuronal identity (<a href=\"#bib94\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">London et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Renart et al., 2010</a>). On the other hand, we demonstrated that fluctuations in single neuron firing, amount to a scale-invariant order in active neuronal groups, suggestive of critical dynamics guiding single neuron firing. Accordingly fluctuations that arise from long-range spatiotemporal correlations between neurons should not be averaged (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fraiman and Chialvo, 2012</a>) but instead need to be taken into account, for example, for theories on cortical population coding (<a href=\"#bib2\">Averbeck et al., 2006</a>). Finally, it is well known that resting or ongoing activity profoundly influences stimulus responses (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arieli et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Sato et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Luczak et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib118\">Womelsdorf et al., 2012</a>). For example, evoked visual responses correlate strongly with ongoing activity shortly preceding the stimulus (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arieli et al., 1996</a>). Long-term temporal correlations have been soundly established at the population level, such as the EEG (<a href=\"#bib48\">Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001</a>) and ECoG (<a href=\"#bib34\">He et al., 2008</a>). Our findings suggest that the occurrence of a single \u2018spontaneous\u2019 spike or spike burst in the AW state correlates with activity in other PNs over time and distance in cortex, as quantified by the scale-invariant correlation structure established by neuronal avalanches. We suggest that this will be of particular importance in the context of \u2018noise correlations\u2019, which capture the non-stimulus induced correlation structure and tend to affect the decoding capability of a neuronal population (<a href=\"#bib2\">Averbeck et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Insabato et al., 2014</a>)."

By demonstrating such scale-invariance to exist at the neuron level, we suggest that neuronal avalanches provide a unifying framework of cell assembly formation in cortex that ranges from local groups of neurons to the global scale of the brain."

To this end, animals were anesthetized (isoflurane: 4% induction, 1.5\u20132% maintenance) and mounted in a stereotaxic frame. After a midline incision was made in the scalp, the skull surface was cleared of membranes; adhesive luting cement (C&amp;B; Metabond, Parkell, Inc., Edgewood, NY) was applied contralaterally to the YC2.60-expressing hemisphere, followed by attachment of the head bar using Grip cement (Dentsply International Inc., Milford, DE). Rats were given an analgesic (Ketoprofen, 5 mg/kg s.c) for up to 2 days post surgery. Rats were habituated to the recording condition for up to 5 sessions post surgery. In each session, the rat was briefly anesthetized (&lt;5 min of 2\u20133% isoflurane) and installed in the head fixation apparatus, which consisted of a plastic tube which loosely confined the rat's limbs without restricting breathing, a platform and a custom-made steel beam, which screwed into the head bar at one end and a fixed post at the other end, allowing horizontal, vertical, and axial freedom of movement to position the rat's head under the 2-PI objective. After awakening, rats were left in the apparatus for 10\u201320 min per session. Rats became comfortable with the recording condition after 3\u20135 habituation sessions.

Rats were anesthetized (isoflurane: 4% induction, 1.5\u20132% maintenance) and mounted in a stereotaxic frame.

A section of the skull (\u223c3\u20134 mm diameter) was removed using a dental drill and the underlying dura was resected. Care was taken not to damage any subdural blood vessels.

In general, single AP detection in vivo is still below 100% for yellow chameleons and related GECIs (<a href=\"#bib54\">L\u00fctcke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Margolis et al., 2012</a>). We excluded D3cpv, which shows single AP sensitivity, due to its saturation for small AP bursts (<a href=\"#bib116\">Wallace et al., 2008</a>). YC3.60 is an interesting alternative to YC2.60 due to its higher K<sub>D</sub> and shorter decay time constant (0.5 s in vivo at physiological temperature; 0.8 s in vitro at room temperature [<a href=\"#bib119\">Yamada et al., 2011</a>]). While a short decay constant allows for higher temporal resolution in imaging, YC3.60 is about 50% less sensitive to single APs compared to YC2.60. Given the relatively low spontaneous AP rate for neurons in superficial cortical layers in vivo (for review see [<a href=\"#bib3\">Barth and Poulet, 2012</a>]), we, therefore, opted for YC2.60 with its somewhat longer decay constant of \u223c1\u20132 s. Our observation of 4\u20135% \u0394R/R for single APs using YC2.60 in layer 2/3 (L2/3) PNs in vitro at 32\u00b0C is within the range reported for D3cpv in vitro (8.3% at room temperature) and in vivo (3.5%) (<a href=\"#bib116\">Wallace et al., 2008</a>). It is also in line for YC2.60 single AP detection at 33\u00b0C in the acute slice, which shows a \u0394R/R of \u223c4\u20135% and a decay time constant of \u223c2 s for a 10 AP burst (<a href=\"#bib119\">Yamada et al., 2011</a>). For YC3.60, sensitivity and decay time constant were shown to be similar in vivo (<a href=\"#bib54\">L\u00fctcke et al., 2010</a>) and in vitro when measured at physiological temperature (<a href=\"#bib119\">Yamada et al., 2011</a>). The range in similarities for YC GECIs suggests that our YC2.60 in vitro characterization at physiological temperature similarly predicts its performance in vivo. This is further supported by the insensitivity of coefficient of variation (CV) in our in vivo data to the changes in \u03bb<sub>thr</sub> &lt; 1 (<i>cf</i>. <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which is in line with the binary detection operation of single APs for that range (<i>cf</i>. <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Boxcar regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn around the somatic region of labeled neurons for which the nucleus was clearly visible within the cross-sectional somatic area. The boxcar was aligned with the outer perimeter of the neuron, and all pixels within the boxcar were taken for analysis. For YC2.60, the ratio, <i>R</i>, of cpVenus fluorescence to ECFP fluorescence was calculated for each ROI and each frame. The ratio measurement requires neuronal signals to be anti-correlated in the two wavelength bands, which allows for easy identification of non-signal artifact, for example, from small animal movements. A continuous function of fluorescence was calculated as \u2206R/R = (R<sub>ROI</sub> \u2212 R<sub>0</sub>)/R<sub>0</sub>, where R<sub>ROI</sub> denotes the average fluorescence ratio within the ROI. The baseline fluorescence ratio, R<sub>0</sub>, was defined as the median of R. \u2206R/R was low-pass filtered (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kampa et al., 2011</a>) (3\u0394t; symmetrical Gaussian kernel), and the instantaneous firing rate estimate, \u03bb, in arbitrary units was obtained for each ROI using fast, non-negative deconvolution (<a href=\"#bib115\">Vogelstein et al., 2010</a>) (OOPSI package, Matlab, MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). The decay time constant of the non-negative deconvolution for YC2.60 was \u223c1\u20131.5 s, as estimated from simultaneous cell-attached recording and 2-PI (n = 8 neurons). This value was also obtained by minimizing the summed square error between <i>R</i> and a reconstructed <i>R\u2032</i>, made by convolving an exponential decaying kernel with \u03bb over the range of \u03c4 = \u0394t \u2212 15 \u00d7 \u0394t for neuronal populations recorded in vivo and in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and is in line with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib119\">Yamada et al., 2011</a>).

The array was lowered into the cortex under visual control until the last electrode entered layer 1, anchored using dental cement, and the cranial opening was closed for chronic in vivo recordings. The array configuration and array insertion targeted unit activity from within the first 600\u2013800 \u00b5m of cortical depth, which largely covers superficial layers in the adult rat. Unit activity was sampled at 30 kHz and sorted offline (Offline sorter, Plexon, Dallas, TX). Simultaneous LFP recordings from the same electrodes demonstrated nLFP-based avalanche dynamics in the AW state, further supporting superficial layers as the main recording sites (see e.g., [<a href=\"#bib103\">Stewart and Plenz, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gireesh and Plenz, 2008</a>]; data not shown)."

For visualization, cluster size distributions were logarithmically binned (30 bins). Neuronal avalanches were defined by their distribution in cluster size that follows a power law with an exponent close to \u22121.5, up to the cluster size limit. The branching parameter <i>\u03c3</i>, the average ratio of the number of descendants to ancestors within a cascade (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</a>), was estimated using participation counts from the first (ancestor) and subsequent (descendent) \u0394t bins within each cascade. Lifetime, T, was defined as the number of active time bins during the avalanche multiplied by \u0394t. A population thresholding approach on the instantaneous integrated population vector on \u03bb, <i>\u03bb</i><sup>pop</sup>, has recently been introduced as an alternative method to obtain the distribution of cascade sizes (<a href=\"#bib78\">Poil et al., 2012</a>). For a given <i>\u03bb</i><sup>pop</sup> based on a chosen \u03bb<sub>thr</sub>, population thresholds were placed to search for the maximum number of cascade sizes. By including only those \u0394t bins whose member events sum above a minimum threshold, this method avoids issues in cascade concatenation when periods of empty \u0394t bins may be rare due to insufficient temporal resolution or when monitoring a high number of units."

The authors first show that their estimate of instantaneous firing (\u03bb) from calcium signals is linked to action potental firing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and they show that neurons fired irregular with long periods of quiescents in all states and showed largest variabilitiy (CV) during the awakening period (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). More importantly, the study reports that neural firing (indexed as \u03bb) showed only low correlations with somewhat more correlated firing during awakening that during the awake state. Interestingly, avalanche dynamics was more pronounced during the awake state (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, with the so called avalanche life time distributions following a power law as described before). The authors also show in in vitro recordings that the temporal correlations are reduced (with inhibition) or enhanced (during disinhibition) but remained intact during moderate reductions of GABAa, AMPA or NMDA synaptic activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Spatial clustering was absent in these in vitro recordings."

Shouldn't a statistical test compare two functions in their degree of predicting the distribution? I ask this because it is one thing to describe the dynamics of the system as satisfying a scale free power law, but the interpretation and inferences would be different if other non-scale free functions describe the data in similar good ways. What would happen to the criticality perspective if future studies would show that the dynamics would follow only \u201csomewhat\u201d a power law, but that the fine scale dynamics can be as well described by scale specific function?

The only mentioned justification for the choice (i.e., showing that avalanches can arise solely from within cortex and sensitive to excitation-inhibition ratio) is somewhat weak given the wealth of cited in-vitro records showing exactly this (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Shew et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Pasquale et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Stewart and Plenz, 2006</a>).

In addition, although we have currently unpublished results demonstrating that in the behaving macaque monkey avalanches dynamics is maintained during a visual discrimination task (Shan et al. 2014 SfN abstract), we consider these results too preliminary to justify a whole section. We specified though in our \u2018final conclusions\u2019 the potential advantages of critical layer 2/3 networks with respect to processing of layer 4 inputs."

While our method for achieving GECI expression (in utero electroporation) specifically targets pyramidal neurons, we never intended to project the idea that layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons are the only cell type required for avalanche generation. We believe though that it is important to demonstrate avalanche organization in pyramidal neuron group output. First, interneurons due to their high firing rates can in principle inflate spike clusters, in which case large cluster sizes might simply reflect neuronal cell type differences rather than interactions within neuronal groups. Second, by focusing on pyramidal neurons, we are studying the computational output of a local cortical microcircuit. We now state clearly that we do not assume our data show that avalanches only require pyramidal neurons. These three aspects are stated upfront at the beginning of our Discussion and are also revisited at other places in the text. We have also changed the title accordingly by replacing \u2018emergence\u2019 with the more neutral statement of \u2018organization\u2019. Our results do not exclude the possibility that signatures of criticality might be found in other cell types."

For example, strongly bursting interneurons can lead to large spike clusters, in which case heavy-tail size distributions are more likely to reflect cell type diversity rather than neuronal interactions.
