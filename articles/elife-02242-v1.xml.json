                    "text": "Recent epidemiological and laboratory-based studies suggest that the anti-diabetic drug metformin prevents cancer progression. How metformin diminishes tumor growth is not fully understood. In this study, we report that in human cancer cells, metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) activity and cellular respiration. Metformin inhibited cellular proliferation in the presence of glucose, but induced cell death upon glucose deprivation, indicating that cancer cells rely exclusively on glycolysis for survival in the presence of metformin. Metformin also reduced hypoxic activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). All of these effects of metformin were reversed when the metformin-resistant <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> NADH dehydrogenase NDI1 was overexpressed. In vivo, the administration of metformin to mice inhibited the growth of control human cancer cells but not those expressing NDI1. Thus, we have demonstrated that metformin's inhibitory effects on cancer progression are cancer cell autonomous and depend on its ability to inhibit mitochondrial complex I."

How metformin diminishes tumor growth is not fully understood. In this study, we report that in human cancer cells, metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) activity and cellular respiration. Metformin inhibited cellular proliferation in the presence of glucose, but induced cell death upon glucose deprivation, indicating that cancer cells rely exclusively on glycolysis for survival in the presence of metformin. Metformin also reduced hypoxic activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). All of these effects of metformin were reversed when the metformin-resistant <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> NADH dehydrogenase NDI1 was overexpressed. In vivo, the administration of metformin to mice inhibited the growth of control human cancer cells but not those expressing NDI1. Thus, we have demonstrated that metformin's inhibitory effects on cancer progression are cancer cell autonomous and depend on its ability to inhibit mitochondrial complex I."

Alternatively, metformin could target cancer cells more directly by cutting the energy supply produced by their mitochondria. Metformin has been shown to disrupt complex I of the electron transport chain that is used by cells to generate energy. However, it is not known if disrupting complex I would actually stop cells dividing because they can generate energy in other ways."

Metformin may act at the organismal level, reducing levels of circulating insulin, a known mitogen for cancer cells. Alternatively, metformin may act in a cancer cell autonomous manner. Metformin is known to inhibit mitochondrial complex I in vitro (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ota et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">El-Mir et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Owen et al., 2000</a>) and it is thus possible that this targeting of the electron transport chain could inhibit tumor cell growth (<a href=\"#bib8\">Birsoy et al., 2012</a>). This latter hypothesis has been questioned as cancer cells have the ability to survive on ATP produced exclusively by glycolysis. Furthermore, cancer cells have been shown to conduct glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation to generate the TCA cycle intermediates required for cell proliferation when the electron transport chain is inhibited (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mullen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fendt et al., 2013</a>). Thus, it is not clear whether inhibition of complex I by metformin would result in decreasing tumor growth. In the present study, we directly tested whether inhibition of cancer cell mitochondrial complex I by metformin was required to decrease cell proliferation in vitro and tumor progression in vivo<i>.</i>"

NDI1-HCT 116 p53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells demonstrated a slight, non-significant elevation in basal cellular oxygen consumption compared to control cells and were completely resistant to the effects of metformin on cellular oxygen consumption (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Saponin removes cholesterol from plasma membranes, allowing the entry of metabolic substrates directly to mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jamur and Oliver, 2010</a>). In the presence of ADP and the complex I substrates pyruvate and malate, metformin fully inhibited oxygen consumption in permeabilized Control-HCT 116 p53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). By contrast, metformin had no effect on pyruvate/malate-driven oxygen consumption in NDI1-HCT 116 p53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Metformin also had no effect on oxygen consumption in saponin-permeabilized cells respiring on the complex II substrate succinate in the presence of ADP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Interestingly, in saponin-permeabilized cells, metformin significantly inhibited complex I-dependent respiration at a much lower concentration than that required to inhibit oxygen consumption of intact cells, suggesting that transport across the plasma membrane is a barrier to metformin's inhibition of complex I. Metformin is known to slowly accumulate in cells in which its uptake is mediated by organic cation transporters (OCTs) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Emami Riedmaier et al., 2013</a>). To ensure that NDI1-HCT 116 p53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells are not refractory to metformin because of a change in metformin uptake, we analyzed the expression of OCT 1 in both control and NDI1-HCT 116 p53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells.

Metformin inhibited proliferation of wild-type Control-CCL16 hamster fibroblasts but not that of B2-CCL16 cells or of B2-CCL16 cells reconstituted with NDI1 (NDI1-CCL16). Metformin and phenformin inhibited cellular oxygen consumption in wild-type CCL16 but not in CCL16-NDI1 cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 and 2</a>). When these cells were cultured in galactose-substituted media, both metformin and phenformin induced cell death only in wild-type CCL16 cells. Survival of NDI1-CCL16 cells was not affected by metformin or phenformin (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>).

Alternatively, the non-polar hydrocarbon-side chain of the drug could promote binding to complexes within mitochondrial membranes. We tested whether the mitochondrial membrane potential is necessary for metformin-dependent inhibition of complex I. Saponin-permeabilized Control-HCT 116 p53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells were induced to respire on pyruvate/malate in the presence of either ADP or CCCP. Although both ADP and CCCP induce mitochondrial respiration, only CCCP depolarizes mitochondrial inner membrane potential. Metformin inhibited ADP but not CCCP stimulated oxygen consumption indicating that the metformin-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial complex I required polarized mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Rotenone, an irreversible inhibitor of complex I, does not require polarized mitochondria to inhibit mitochondrial oxygen consumption (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Our results suggest that metformin would not be effective in suppressing complex I activity of intact cells if mitochondrial inner membrane potential was disrupted. Metformin-mediated inhibition of the electron transport chain diminishes proton pumping, which might depolarize the mitochondrial membrane, thus limiting accumulation of the drug. However, we did not observe a reduction in the mitochondrial inner membrane potential measured using TMRE fluorescent dye in Control and NDI1 HCT116 p53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells after metformin treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). When electron transport function is inhibited, the ATP synthase can function in reverse such that it uses ATP generated by glycolysis to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, maintaining membrane potential (<a href=\"#bib2\">Appleby et al., 1999</a>). The ATP synthase inhibitor, Oligomycin A, diminished TMRE fluorescence in Control-HCT 116 p53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells treated with metformin suggesting that in the presence of metformin, intact cells maintain their mitochondrial membrane potential by reversal of the ATP synthase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>)."

A549 cells are null for the tumor suppressor LKB1 and are known to be responsive to metformin therapy (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rocha et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, LKB1-deficient tumors are more susceptible to the related biguanide phenformin (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shackelford et al., 2013</a>). We replaced the endogenous mitochondrial complex I by expressing the NDI1 protein in A549 cells stably expressing shRNA against NDUFS3 (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), referred to as NDI1-shNDUFS3-A549 cells. The Control-A549 cells contain the empty vectors with selection markers BFP and puromycin for NDI1 and shRNA, respectively. NDI1-NDUFS3-A549 cells were resistant to the metformin-mediated reduction in cellular and mitochondrial oxygen consumption and cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013G</a>). Metformin also decreased HIF-1<i>a</i> protein levels in control but not in NDI1-NDUFS3-A549 cells (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Control-A549 cells subcutaneously injected into the left flank of nude mice rapidly grew in vivo, while tumors from mice fed metformin through drinking water <i>ad libitum</i> starting 2 weeks prior to tumor induction exhibited a marked reduction in growth over 45 days (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). By contrast, NDI1-NDUFS3-A549 xenografts were completely resistant to metformin therapy, suggesting that metformin carries out its tumor inhibitory effects in a cell autonomous manner through inhibition of mitochondrial complex I in these cells (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). NDI1-NDUFS3-A549 xenografts grew slower than control xenografts in untreated mice. An alternative explanation for the resistance of NDI1-NDUFS3-A549 cells to metformin could be that effects of metformin are blunted in slower-growing cells. However, based on our results from HCT116 cells in vivo and extensive analysis of A549 cells in vitro, we find that it is likely that NDI1 expressing A549 cells are also resistant to metformin in vivo due to rescue of complex I activity by the NDI1 protein."

Metformin has been previously shown to inhibit mitochondrial complex I, yet it is not known whether metformin exhibits its anti-tumor effects through inhibition of complex I. It is important to note that many commonly utilized drugs have been shown to inhibit mitochondrial function in vitro; however, for many of these drugs it is not clear whether the in vivo mechanism of action is through modulating mitochondrial metabolism (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gohil et al., 2010</a>). In the present study, we genetically demonstrate that metformin acts as a complex I inhibitor in vitro and in vivo to inhibit tumorigenesis. Our current findings bolster our previous findings highlighting the importance of mitochondrial metabolism as essential for cancer proliferation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Weinberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sullivan et al., 2013</a>). Our results are consistent with a recent report demonstrating another biguanide phenformin exerts its anti-tumor effects by inhibiting complex I (<a href=\"#bib7\">Birsoy et al., 2014</a>). However, unlike metformin, phenformin has been discontinued because of frequent occurrence of lactic acidosis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bailey and Turner, 1996</a>). While our study highlights the importance of mitochondrial complex I inhibition within cancer cells as a major mechanism by which metformin reduces tumor burden, it does not necessarily preclude any additional organismal effects of metformin that might reduce tumor progression in certain cancers. Specifically, cancer cells that express insulin receptors might be affected by metformin's inhibition on hepatic gluconeogenesis to reduce circulating insulin levels (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goodwin et al., 2012</a>)."

Cancer cells are likely to have a wide range in expression of uptake and extrusion proteins allowing for metformin accumulation. The uptake of metformin in mitochondria is also dependent on mitochondrial membrane potential. Metformin exists as a cation at physiological pH and thus its accumulation within mitochondria is predicted to increase as a function of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The inhibition of electron transport at complex I by metformin should reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential as proton pumping is linked to electron transport. However, we observed that metformin-treated cells maintain their mitochondrial membrane potential in part due to the reversal of the ATP synthase thus allowing accumulation of metformin in the mitochondrial matrix (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). It is well known that cells with compromised ETC can sustain mitochondrial membrane potential through this mechanism (<a href=\"#bib2\">Appleby et al., 1999</a>). Collectively, our results indicate that will inhibit mitochondrial complex I and decrease tumorigenesis in cancer cells that have transporters across the plasma membrane, as well as a robust inner mitochondrial membrane potential to allow metformin to reach the mitochondrial matrix. It will be of interest to observe whether metformin's efficacy as an anti-cancer agent is dependent on the tumor expression of OCTs."

                        "text": "Our study also reveals that metformin's inhibition on mitochondrial complex I is distinct from the classical complex I inhibitor rotenone. Metformin requires a robust mitochondrial membrane potential to accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix and reversibly inhibits complex I. By contrast, rotenone is an irreversible inhibitor of complex I that does not require mitochondrial membrane potential. Rotenone accumulation is not dependent on specific transporters expressed in the plasma membrane and readily accumulates in all cells and thus is highly toxic. Furthermore, metformin does not promote generation of ROS from complex I, while rotenone stimulates ROS production from complex I (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The flavin site within Complex I produces ROS and previous studies indicate that rotenone inhibits complex I downstream of the flavin site, stimulating ROS generation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pryde and Hirst, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">St-Pierre et al., 2002</a>). It is likely that metformin acts upstream of this site, inhibiting complex I activity while also inhibiting ROS generation. Mitochondrial complex III also produces ROS (<a href=\"#bib30\">Muller et al., 2004</a>). Therefore, metformin by inhibiting the complex I would limit electron flow to complex III thereby reducing ROS generation from complex III. A consequence of mitochondrial complex III ROS generation is the hypoxic activation of HIF-1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bell et al., 2007</a>). Indeed, we found that metformin reduced hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 protein and HIF-dependent target genes. This result is consistent with our previous study in which we identified multiple mitochondrial inhibitors in a large-scale chemical screen for inhibitors of hypoxic activation of HIF (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lin et al., 2008</a>). Beyond cancer, metformin might be an effective treatment for diseases associated with hyperactivation of HIF such as pulmonary hypertension (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shimoda and Semenza, 2011</a>). The concentration of metformin we administered to mice in this report is predicted to achieve plasma concentrations of metformin similar to those in humans receiving metformin therapy. In our study, metformin was administered to drinking water at a concentration of 1.25 mg/ml, approximately 250 mg/kg. Conversion of doses from mice to human is achieved using a formula based on body surface area normalization (<a href=\"#bib36\">Reagan-Shaw et al., 2008</a>). The human equivalent dose of 250 mg/kg metformin in mice is 20.27 mg/kg or 1418 mg for a 70 kg adult. Patients typically receive 500\u20132500 mg metformin per day (<a href=\"#bib38\">Scarpello and Howlett, 2008</a>). In these patients receiving metformin therapy, plasma levels range between 0.5\u20132 \u00b5g/ml; approximately 4 \u00b5M\u201315 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#bib21\">Graham et al., 2011</a>). Previous studies have shown that mice receiving drinking water containing 1\u20135 mg/ml of metformin have a plasma steady-state metformin concentration of 0.45\u20131.7 \u00b5g/ml (<a href=\"#bib27\">Memmott et al., 2010</a>), indicating that our metformin dosage falls within a clinically relevant range."

A perplexing observation revealed in our study and previous studies is that the metformin concentrations required to induce biological effects in vitro are a magnitude of order higher than plasma level concentrations of metformin in vivo. A likely cause for this difference is the accumulation of metformin in liver or tumors to local concentrations that are much higher than in the circulating plasma. Indeed, the gut has been shown to accumulate metformin in the mM range (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bailey et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Proctor et al., 2008</a>)."

Metformin inhibits tumorigenesis through multiple mechanisms including the induction of cancer cell death in conditions, when glucose is limited and through inhibition of mitochondrial ROS-dependent signaling pathways that promote tumorigenesis (i.e., HIF). These results indicate that metformin would be most effective in low glucose and oxygen conditions. It will be of interest to determine whether metformin treatment might provide a useful adjunct to therapies that limit glucose uptake (e.g., PI3K inhibitors) or drive tumors to low glucose and oxygen levels (e.g., anti-angiogenic inhibitors)."

Mitochondrial fractions were suspended in a reaction buffer containing 120 mM KCl, 5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.3% BSA, pH 7.2. Mitochondria respired on 2.5 mM pyruvate and 1 mM malate in the presence or absence of 500 nm Antimycin A or 1 mM Metformin. Superoxide dismutase (200 U/ml; Sigma) was used to convert mitochondria-produced superoxide to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). In the presence of horseradish peroxidase (10 U/ml, Thermo Scientific), Amplex Red (100 \u00b5M, Molecular Probes) reacts with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, producing the fluorescent oxidation product, resorufin.

OCT1 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) and NDUFS3 (MitoSciences) protein expression were assessed using the same technique above without any treatment conditions. \u03b1-tubulin (Sigma) was used as a loading control for protein blots assessing HIF1a and NDUFS3 protein levels while \u03b2-actin (Sigma) was used as a control for OCT1 protein quantification. Image Studio Lite version 3.1 (Licor) was used for analysis and quantification of protein levels. In brief, blots were scanned at high resolution and imported into Image Studio. Individual lanes of HIF1\u03b1 and OCT1 protein levels were normalized to tubulin and actin respectively. Relative levels of HIF1a were normalized to an untreated sample incubated at 21% O<sub>2</sub>."

Metformin inhibited cellular oxygen consumption, reduced proliferation and induced death in the absence of glucose by targeting complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in cancer cells. In addition, hypoxic activation of HIF-1 was reduced in metformin treated cells and metformin reduced the growth of tumour xenografts in mice. The experiments are well conceived and provide novel information related to the effects of metformin on metabolic and tumor growth control. The authors used a number of conventional approaches to pinpoint Complex I as a site of action of metformin, whose exact molecular function had been controversial in the literature. The authors used a single cell line HCT116, which lacks p53 to perform their experiments. Hence, whether the conclusions are generalizable could be equivocal. Nonetheless, the authors used the yeast equivalent of Complex I, the NDI1 NADH dehydrogenase, which is resistant to metformin, and showed it could rescue metformin inhibition of HCT116 cells. The authors also linked metformin mediated inhibition of HIF1 activity under hypoxia and demonstrated that this could also be rescued by NDI1. Lastly, NDI1 was able to rescue the inhibition of HCT116 tumorigenesis by metformin in vivo."

There are a number of substantive concerns that should be addressed in the revised manuscript."

This experimental setup allowed us to bolster our findings in HCT116 cells and test the effect of NDI1 expression in a human cell line which lacked endogenous complex I activity. One caveat to this experiment is that the tumor growth of the NDUSF3 shRNA/ND1 A549 cells is slower than their controls. Nevertheless, metformin substantially reduced control cells tumor growth while it had no effect on the growth of NDI1 expressing/NDUSF3 shRNA cells (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). We realize that an alternative explanation could be that metformin is not as effective in NDI1/NDUSF3 A549 cells due to their slower growth. We acknowledge this explanation in the current manuscript. Based on HCT116 cells and extensive in vitro data, it is likely that NDI1 expressing A549 cells are also resistant to metformin in vivo due to rescue of complex I activity by the NDI1 protein."
