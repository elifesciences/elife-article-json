However, methods to store and interrogate the large datasets produced by these experiments are not widely available. Furthermore, recently developed methods for relating tissue shape changes to cell dynamics have not yet been widely applied by biologists because of their technical complexity. We therefore developed a database format that stores cellular connectivity and geometry information of deforming epithelial tissues, and computational tools to interrogate it and perform multi-scale analysis of morphogenesis. We provide tutorials for this computational framework, called TissueMiner, and demonstrate its capabilities by comparing cell and tissue dynamics in vein and inter-vein subregions of the <i>Drosophila</i> pupal wing. These analyses reveal an unexpected role for convergent extension in shaping wing veins."

However, methods to store and interrogate the large datasets produced by these experiments are not widely available. Furthermore, recently developed methods for relating tissue shape changes to cell dynamics have not yet been widely applied by biologists because of their technical complexity. We therefore developed a database format that stores cellular connectivity and geometry information of deforming epithelial tissues, and computational tools to interrogate it and perform multi-scale analysis of morphogenesis. We provide tutorials for this computational framework, called TissueMiner, and demonstrate its capabilities by comparing cell and tissue dynamics in vein and inter-vein subregions of the <i>Drosophila</i> pupal wing. These analyses reveal an unexpected role for convergent extension in shaping wing veins."

TissueMiner was then used to identify vein cells at late stages of wing development and follow them backward in time to reveal their position at early stages. This showed that veins become narrower and more elongated because the cells that make up the veins shrink more than cells in other regions."

We recently addressed this question by analyzing morphogenesis of the\u00a0<i>Drosophila</i> pupal wing at cellular resolution (<a href=\"#bib13\">Etournay et al., 2015</a>). To understand the cellular contributions to pupal wing\u00a0shape changes, we quantified the spatial and temporal distribution of both cell state properties (e.g. cell area, shape and packing geometry),\u00a0as well as\u00a0dynamic cellular events like rearrangements, divisions, and extrusions. We quantitatively accounted for wing shape changes on the basis of these cellular events. By combining these analyses with mechanical and genetic perturbations, we were able to develop a multiscale physical model for wing morphogenesis and show how the interplay between epithelial stresses and cell dynamics reshapes the pupal wing."

However, more\u00a0advanced analysis is required to quantify, interpret and visualize\u00a0the information derived from segmentation and tracking. Epithelial cells share a set of core behaviors, such as division, rearrangement, shape change and extrusion, which underlie a wide variety of morphogenetic events in different tissues.\u00a0Methods for analyzing these core behaviors have been developed independently in several labs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Blanchard et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bosveld et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Etournay et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib17\">Guirao et al., 2015</a>).

It also facilitates\u00a0the comparison of quantities within and between tissues. To make TissueMiner accessible to a novice, we provide tutorials that guide the user through its capabilities in detail and release a workflow that automatically performs most of the analysis and visualization tasks we reported previously for\u00a0<i>Drosophila</i> pupal wings (<a href=\"#bib13\">Etournay et al., 2015</a>).

This software generates segmented images, referred to as segmentation masks that contain information about cell geometry, cell\u00a0neighbor topology and cell ancestry, which are essential for the study of morphogenesis\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Aigouy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sagner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Etournay et al., 2015</a>).

Therefore, we developed tools to enable the user to define regions of interest, synchronize movies in time, and align all tissues to a common orientation. We then provide tools to easily plot average quantities in different regions or across movies. For each type of measurement, we refer to the tutorials regarding the specific visualization tools we have built (<a href=\"#B1\">Box 1</a>)."

The <i>raw</i> ROI corresponds to all segmented and tracked cells. However cells located at the tissue margin may move in and out of the field of view of the microscope lens. TissueMiner identifies the population of cells (<i>whole_tissue</i>) whose entire lineage lies within the field of view throughout the movie. To identify this population, we developed a filtering tool to discard in each movie frame margin cells located at the edge of the segmentation mask and one additional row of cells that contact the margin cells. The choice of discarding two rows of cells is motivated by the fact that segmentation quality drops near the margin. We iterate over all time points to ensure that we discard all cells moving in and out the field of view (see Materials and methods). User-defined ROI\u2019s are also subjected to this filtering."

Quantifying average area values in vein and inter-vein ROI\u2019s reveals that vein cells contract over a longer period of time than inter-vein cells, and thus have a smaller cross-sectional area at the end of morphogenesis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>).

This analysis is largely consistent with the cell division timing inferred from classical BrdU pulse-chase experiments (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schubiger and Palka, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Milan et al., 1996</a>), but also reveals unexpected additional features. The pattern of cell divisions correlates with veins: most cells in the wing blade divide only once during pupal morphogenesis,\u00a0whereas in some parts of inter-vein regions they divide twice. These include the cells lying adjacent to veins L3, L4 and L5, and the region posterior to L5.

In the simplest case, a T1 transition involves two pairs of cells, that exchange neighbors by disassembling one cell-cell contact and replacing it by another \u2013 bringing together two previously separated cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In reality, cell contacts may undergo multiple rounds of shrinkage and regrowth before resolving (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A'</a>). Furthermore some epithelia undergo the related process of rosette formation where multiple cell junctions are disassembled before new neighbors are brought into contact. By separately quantifying the orientation with which cell contacts are gained and lost, one can reveal whether there is a net directionality to cell junction assembly and disassembly. To identify gained and lost cell contacts, we compare cell neighbor relationships between 2 subsequent frames. We exclude changes in neighbor relationships resulting from cell division, extrusion or a cell moving in and out of the field of view. The remaining neighbor relationship changes are used to define cell contacts that have appeared or disappeared."

T1 transitions and cell elongation are major contributors to total PD shear, and they display complementary behavior that evolves over time. In the first phase, cells elongate in the PD axis in response to tissue stresses generated by hinge contraction, and by actively oriented T1 transitions that occur first along the AP axis. In the second phase, cell elongation causes the orientation of T1 transitions to shift\u00a090\u02da\u00a0from the AP to the PD axis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Etournay et al., 2015</a>). These PD oriented T1 transitions both contribute to tissue shear and relax PD cell elongation. We now compare shear and cellular contributions to shear in vein and inter-vein regions. Tissue shear peaks earlier in inter-vein regions than in veins, but veins shear more overall. Examining the cellular contributions to shear suggests that increased shear in veins reflects a different relationship between cell elongation and T1 transitions. PD-oriented T1 transitions do not only produce more shear in veins, they also fail to relax PD cell elongation as much as in inter-vein regions."

Here, to illustrate the utility of the TissueMiner framework, we compared the behavior of vein and inter-vein regions in the developing pupal wing.\u00a0Comparing cell dynamics in veins and inter-vein regions provided an unexpected explanation for the process of 'vein refinement'. Vein refinement refers to the fact that veins become narrower during pupal morphogenesis. This had been interpreted as a signaling-dependent reduction in the number of cells assuming the vein fate (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blair, 2007</a>). Here we show instead that vein narrowing results from a convergent extension-like process that is stronger in veins than in inter-vein regions. This elongates and narrows the veins without reducing vein cell number. It will be interesting to examine how signaling pathways involved in vein refinement influence cell dynamics in veins during morphogenesis. The standardization of analysis that TissueMiner provides will facilitate these and other comparisons critical for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying epithelial morphogenesis."

The entities defined in the conceptual scheme are converted into tables containing one primary key (upper part of the table) that uniquely defines each record in the table, the properties of each record, and the foreign keys (arrows). Foreign keys are properties of one table pointing to the primary key of a related table (ex: conj_dbond_id:dbond_id means that the conj_dbond_id column is a foreign key whose values must be defined in the dbond_id column of the dbonds table). As a consequence of logical contraints by foreign keys, tables harbor more columns that one expected from looking at <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>.

This graph represents both the execution dependency (grey arrows) and the execution state of the workflow (solid or dashed line). Each box corresponds to an execution rule, namely a program to be run along with required input(s) and expected output(s). This DAG can be generated at any time when running the workflow (see documentation). Solid lines indicate the rules that have not been executed yet, whereas dashed lines depict completed jobs. The first rule to be executed is called 'prepare_movie': it prepares the tracked images from TissueAnalyzer to be converted by the parser into tables of values containing all necessary entities along with their properties ('parse_tables' rule). Then the 'make_db' rule is executed for building the database. Following the grey arrows can one navigate into the next steps of the workflow. The 'roi_tracking' rule filters out cells in contact to margin cells including user-defined regions of interest, and the 'roi_movie' rule allows us to visualize regions of interest over time. The 'deformation_movies' and 'db_elongation_movies'\u00a0rules generate annotated movies to visualize the deformation of the tissue and the cell state properties (area, elongation). The 'four_way' rule detects four-way vertices and performs basic statistics on vertices. The 'tri_create' rule performs the triangulation of the network for further shear calculation and visualization ('shear_calculate' and 'shear_movies'). It also enables triangle tracking and mapping to each type of cell event ('tri_categorize'). The 'topo_countT1' rule\u00a0detects neighbor changes that are not due to division or extrusion, and categorizes them into <i>gained</i> or <i>lost</i> neighbors. The 'topo_movies' rule allows one to visualize the coarse-grained rates of division and neighbor changes on the tissue. The 'topo_unbalance'\u00a0rule is a quality check to verify that the number of gained neighbors is similar to the number of lost neighbors. The 'polygon_class' rule performs the cell-neighbor number count. The 'lineage_colors' rule allows us to optimize the color of each lineage group such that adjacent lineage groups always have different colors. Finally, the 'lineage_movies' rule\u00a0allows one to visualize lineage groups and cell generations on the tissue. The rule 'all' checks that all upstream jobs have been completed."

By comparing the list of neighboring cell identifiers for a given cell between two consecutive frames [<i>f,\u00a0f</i>\u00a0+\u00a01], can one identify and count the changes in neighbor relationships. These can be subdivided into those caused by\u00a0cell divisions, cell extrusions or the simple gain or loss of a cell contact (not due to division or extrusion). We call these half-T1\u2019s because they resemble the gain and loss of cell contacts that occurs during a T1 transition \u2013 although they may also be generated by other events such as rosette formation. To assign a neighbor change to the half-T1 category, the corresponding cell identifiers must be present in both frames, ruling out extrusions and cells moving in and out of the field of view. To detect half-T1\u2019s that occur simultaneously with divisions, we mask neighbor changes due to divisions by propagating the mother cell identifier (frame <i>f</i>) to the two daughter cells (frame <i>f+1</i>) that we fuse into one fake cell having the mother\u00a0cell identifier. We iterate over each pair of consecutive frames and store the half-T1 events due to a gain and a loss of cell neighbors."

By definition the root of each lineage tree is considered as the F<sub>0</sub> generation and is thus given a generation value of 0. We follow ROI\u2019s backward and forward in time by browsing lineage graphs that were selected based on the regions drawn\u00a0by using the <i>draw_n_get_ROIcoord.ijm</i> Fiji macro. However cells may be lost or not detected when browsing the lineages. One primary reason is that extruding cells are not detected when browsing the lineage backward in time. Cells could also be lost due to possible tracking mistakes. To improve spatial continuity of ROI\u2019s we have implemented a method to reassign lost cells to ROI\u2019s when located within ROI\u2019s. To identify lost cells for a frame within a given ROI, we first distinguish bonds that connect two cells within the ROI, only one cell within the ROI or none. All corresponding cell-pairs define an undirected graph on which a connected component analysis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nepusz, 2006</a>)\u00a0allows to identify the ROI and non-ROI regions. All cells of non-ROI regions, except for the largest one, are reassigned to become part of the ROI. By doing so, we make the assumption that the largest non-ROI component is defined by the tissue surrounding the ROI."

In both masks, cell circumferences are represented by one pixel thick white lines. In the <i>tracked-cell</i> mask, all pixels inside the cell circumference have the same unique color. In consecutive frames, the same cell has the same color. In the <i>cell-division</i> mask, each cell is colored either in black or in blue. If a cell is blue, it is a daughter cell that emerged from a division between two consecutive frames. Otherwise, a cell is black in the <i>cell-division</i> mask."

Afterwards, it analyzes the continuity of cell existences across consecutive frames. In particular, it tries to infer reasons for appearance or disappearance of cells. Finally, based on this information, history and lineage can be established for each cell (see Materials and methods)."

Whenever it hits a cell boundary (white pixel), it defines the cell circumference and divides it into bonds defined as\u00a0contiguous white pixels that are in contact with exactly two cells, and vertices defined as white pixel surrounded by 3 or more pixels of different colors). The topology, namely how neighboring cells are arranged around each cell, is obtained by creating a counter-clockwise series of consecutive directed bonds. Each directed bond stems from a unique vertex and points to the next vertex along the cell circumference. We created the concept of directed bonds to unambiguously characterize the wiring between cells, vertices, and (undirected) bonds (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The parser stores the topology by creating the relation of each directed bond with its next counter-clockwise follower on the cell circumference and with the vertex from which it stems (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). To store the cell-nearest-neighbor relationships, we map each cell-cell contact (bond) to the two corresponding directed bonds, where each directed bond is associated with a single cell and a single vertex. This is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, where the cyan directed bond points towards vertex <math id=\"inf39\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>\u00a0and lies on the side of cell <math id=\"inf40\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, whereas the magenta directed bond points towards vertex <math id=\"inf41\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi>j</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>\u00a0and lies on the side of cell\u00a0<math id=\"inf42\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi>\u03b2</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>.

This conceptual approach defines the basic elements of the entity-relationship model (<a href=\"#bib29\">Peter Pin-Shan, 1976</a>): the entity, the association, the cardinality and the identifier. Entities consist of objects (<i>cells</i>, <i>bonds</i>, <i>vertices</i>, <i>frames</i>) or concepts (<i>cell_histories</i>, <i>directed_bonds</i>) that can be uniquely identified. The association is a link that relates two entities. The identifier is an obligatory property of an entity and uniquely defines each occurrence of the entity. The cardinality reflects the minimum and maximum connections (functional dependencies) between the identifiers of two associated entities: [1,n] stands for one-to-many, [0,n] for none-to-many, [1,1] for one-to-one, and [0,1] for none-to-one. Hence, each association is assigned two cardinalities corresponding to the 2 possible directions of association between the two entities. For the sake of clarity, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> shows a simplified 'entity-relationship' scheme of the TM-DB without cardinalities. However, cardinalities are used in the Merise method to translate the conceptual scheme (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) into the logical scheme shown in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>. We therefore show them in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. The rules to translate a conceptual scheme to a logical one can be found here (<a href=\"#bib32\">Tardieu et al., 2000</a>). Below, we explain our conceptual scheme along with its translation into the logical scheme, which can be directly implemented using a chosen SQL language. Applying these rules to our TM-DB, these entities become physical tables in the logical scheme, and associations become table columns ('foreign keys' in blue) in related tables (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The foreign keys constitute a referential integrity constraint between tables."

The second normal form adds constraints on the identifiers: if an identifier is composed of multiple properties (see <i>cells</i> entity), the other properties must be determined by the whole identifier and not by only part of it. The third normal form stipulates that a property isn't allowed to be determined by an existing property that isn't an identifier. In the conceptual scheme, those 3 normal forms ensure\u00a0that the identifier uniquely defines each property of the entity.

The software provides a number of geometric outputs including deformation tensors and cell connectivity. As the tools within TissueMiner appear to be identical to those used by the authors previously (2015 <i>eLife</i> publication), the value of TissueMiner lies not its novelty or proof-of-concept, but squarely in the likelihood of it being used by an average researcher. Both reviewers felt that the software and current tutorials, while expansive, were far from user-friendly in their current implementation, and the tutorials, while extensive, assumed far more technical background than the average user would have. Nevertheless, both reviewers felt that TissueMiner, if improved as described below, would be an important advance and could be very useful to the community."
