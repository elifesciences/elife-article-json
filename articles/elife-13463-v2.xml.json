However, the molecular basis of this early malignant susceptibility remains unknown. During <i>Drosophila</i> development, neural stem cells (NSCs) divide asymmetrically and generate intermediate progenitors that rapidly differentiate in neurons. Upon gene inactivation, these progeny can dedifferentiate and generate malignant tumors. Here, we find that intermediate progenitors are prone to malignancy only when born during an early window of development while expressing the transcription factor Chinmo, and the mRNA-binding proteins Imp/IGF2BP and Lin-28. These genes compose an oncogenic module that is coopted upon dedifferentiation of early-born intermediate progenitors to drive unlimited tumor growth. In late larvae, temporal transcription factor progression in NSCs silences the module, thereby limiting mitotic potential and terminating the window of malignant susceptibility. Thus, this study identifies the gene regulatory network that confers malignant potential to neural tumors with early developmental origins."

However, the molecular basis of this early malignant susceptibility remains unknown. During <i>Drosophila</i> development, neural stem cells (NSCs) divide asymmetrically and generate intermediate progenitors that rapidly differentiate in neurons. Upon gene inactivation, these progeny can dedifferentiate and generate malignant tumors. Here, we find that intermediate progenitors are prone to malignancy only when born during an early window of development while expressing the transcription factor Chinmo, and the mRNA-binding proteins Imp/IGF2BP and Lin-28. These genes compose an oncogenic module that is coopted upon dedifferentiation of early-born intermediate progenitors to drive unlimited tumor growth. In late larvae, temporal transcription factor progression in NSCs silences the module, thereby limiting mitotic potential and terminating the window of malignant susceptibility. Thus, this study identifies the gene regulatory network that confers malignant potential to neural tumors with early developmental origins."

                        "text": "Normal NBs are active from embryogenesis to pupal stages and generate the neurons and glial cells that constitute the <i>Drosophila</i> central nervous system (CNS). Two main types of NBs have been identified. Upon asymmetric division, most NBs (type-I) self-renew while giving rise to an intermediate progenitor, called the ganglion mother cell (GMC), which usually divides once to generate two post-mitotic neurons or glia. In contrast, a small number of NBs (type-II) located in the central brain region of the CNS, generates intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) that can produce a few GMCs allowing for an amplification of post-mitotic progeny in the lineage (<a href=\"#bib33\">Homem and Knoblich, 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). NBs undergo a limited number of divisions during development and invariably stop dividing before adulthood (<a href=\"#bib73\">Truman and Bate, 1988</a>). For NBs located in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of the CNS, this limited mitotic potential is governed by a NB-intrinsic clock that schedules their terminal differentiation during metamorphosis (<a href=\"#bib56\">Maurange et al., 2008</a>). This timing mechanism is set in NBs by the sequential expression of a series of 'temporal' transcription factors that has the ability to endow each progeny with a different neuronal identity according to their birth order (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Maurange, 2012</a>). In addition, NBs in the VNC need to progress up to a late temporal factor in the series to become competent to respond to the hormonal cues promoting cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation during metamorphosis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Homem et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Maurange et al., 2008</a>). In VNC NBs, there are four known temporal transcription factors (Hunchback (Hb) -&gt; Kruppel (Kr) -&gt; Pdm -&gt; Castor (Cas)) mainly expressed during embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baumgardt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Grosskortenhaus et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Isshiki et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kambadur et al., 1998</a>). Cas is re-expressed in early larval NBs presumably followed by other, yet unknown, temporal factors required to set up a late global transition of neuronal identity during larval development and to schedule NB termination during metamorphosis (<a href=\"#bib56\">Maurange et al., 2008</a>). Progression throughout the sequence is governed by cross-regulatory transcriptional interactions between the temporal transcription factors, and can be blocked by continuous mis-expression of a temporal factor or by its inactivation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib37\">Isshiki et al., 2001</a>). Transitions between temporal transcription factors can also be promoted by Seven-up (Svp), an orphan nuclear receptor orthologous to mammalian COUP-TF transcription factors. In particular, Svp is transiently expressed in embryonic NBs, to promote the early Hb-&gt;Kr transition, and in larval NBs to trigger a global temporal transition allowing NBs to switch from generating an early subpopulation of neurons expressing the BTB transcription factor Chinmo to a later sub-population expressing other markers (<a href=\"#bib10\">Benito-Sipos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kanai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Maurange et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Mettler et al., 2006</a>). Inactivation of Svp during early larval stages blocks NBs in an early temporal identity. Consequently, late <i>svp<sup>-/-</sup></i> NBs continuously generate Chinmo<sup>+</sup> neurons, fail to undergo terminal differentiation during metamorphosis, and continue to divide in adults (<a href=\"#bib56\">Maurange et al., 2008</a>).\u00a0Multiple series of temporal transcription factors have been uncovered in the different regions of the CNS, and recent data suggests that this temporal patterning system is evolutionary conserved and operating in mammalian NSCs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Brand and Livesey, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Konstantinides et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mattar et al., 2015</a>)."

This early malignant susceptibility of neural cells is governed by the temporal patterning system that regulates whether or not a pre-existing early oncogenic module, that controls NB mitotic activity during development, can be co-opted to trigger malignant growth. This work therefore uncovers how the temporal transcription factor series regulates NSC mitotic potential during development and governs the malignant susceptibility of neural cells according to their birth-order. Our study provides a model that may help understand the ontogeny of human tumors with early developmental origins."

While wild-type (<i>wt</i>) NBs undergo terminal differentiation during metamorphosis and are absent in adults (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), tumors of dNBs persist in adults and continue growing, forming in 6 day-old adults, large tumors that have fused and invaded the whole VNC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>).

(<b>B</b>) During embryonic and larval development, each VNC NB sequentially expresses a series of transcription factors (Hunchback (Hb), Kruppel (Kr), Pdm1/2 (Pdm), Castor (Cas) and Seven-up (Svp)) inherited by the GMC. The various GMCs subsequently generate different types of neurons (differently colored circles), which identity is determined by their birth-order. NBs that\u00a0are\u00a0mutant for temporal factors, such as <i>cas</i> or <i>svp,</i> fail to progress further in the series and continuously generate the same type of neurons. Such NBs fail to exit the cell cycle during pupal stages and continue dividing during adulthood."

At this time, a large population of GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons (up to 79% of the tumor cell population ( \u00b1 3%; n = 3416; 3 tumors)) could be transiently observed due to the transitory persistence of GFP from dNBs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Similar figures of neural differentiation were not observed in tumors when examined during larval or adult stages. To ensure that this burst of differentiation was not inherent to the use of RNAi, nor specific to the <i>pox<sup>n</sup></i> lineages, we used the MARCM technology (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lee and Luo, 1999</a>) to generate random <i>pros<sup>-/-</sup></i> clones during early larval development (L1/L2). While such clones lead to malignant tumor growth in adults (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), a similar burst of differentiation was observed in most lineages at around 20\u2009hr of metamorphosis (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Interestingly, this event coincides with the timing of <i>wt</i> NB terminal differentiation that occurs in response to the production of the steroid hormone (<a href=\"#bib34\">Homem et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Maurange et al., 2008</a>).

                                "text": "Unlimited tumor growth could be propagated by a resetting of the temporal series in newly-born dNBs. However, of the four known temporal factors in VNC NBs (Hb -&gt; Kr -&gt; Pdm -&gt; Cas) and Svp, only Cas was occasionally detected in tumors observed in late larvae and in adults (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Nevertheless, removing ectopic Cas from <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup></i> tumors did not affect the ability to generate large tumors in adults (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, the persistence of proliferating tumors in adults is neither caused by a reset nor by a stalling at an early stage of the temporal series in dNBs. We then concentrated on Chinmo, a transcription factor known to label a sub-population of early-born neurons in type-I lineages in larvae (<a href=\"#bib56\">Maurange et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zhu et al., 2006</a>), (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We find that Chinmo is not only expressed in early-born neurons of type-I and type-II lineages (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) but also in early NBs from which they are generated. In the VNC, Chinmo is highly expressed in early larval NBs (L1 and L2) and their progeny, but its expression in NBs progressively decreases from early L3 and is switched off in most NBs and their subsequent progeny by midL3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Moreover, when the late L2 pulse of Svp in NBs was abrogated, by inducing <i>svp<sup>-/-</sup></i> MARCM clones in L1, in order to block temporal patterning progression, we observed that NBs failed to silence Chinmo in L3 and adults (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Therefore, Chinmo is a marker of early temporal identity and its window of expression in NBs is terminated in early L3 by progression of the temporal transcription factor series (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>)."

Consistently, adult persistence of tumors originating from <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup>, chinmo<sup>RNAi</sup> </i>clones induced in L1/L2 is reduced by about 30% compared to <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup></i> clones (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This indicates that Chinmo\u00a0confers resistance to the differentiation cues operating during metamorphosis. Additionally, persisting <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup>; chinmo<sup>RNAi</sup></i> tumors are smaller and fail to grow further, or completely differentiate, in 6 day-old adults, while <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup></i>\u00a0control clones rapidly invade the CNS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Failure to grow is, at least, partly due to a low mitotic activity within <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup>; chinmo<sup>RNAi</sup></i> adult tumors, as already observed in larval tumors. Moreover, the mitotic rate in <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup>; chinmo<sup>RNAi</sup></i> tumors decreases from larval to adult stages, while remaining stable in <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup> </i>tumors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), in 6 day-old adults, <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup>; chinmo<sup>RNAi</sup></i> dNBs sometimes show cytoplasmic extensions characteristic of quiescence (<a href=\"#bib18\">Chell and Brand, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Truman and Bate, 1988</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Together, these experiments suggest that dNBs in <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup>; chinmo<sup>RNAi</sup></i> tumors progressively exhaust their proliferation potential. The decreased growth potential of <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup>; chinmo<sup>RNAi</sup></i> tumors was confirmed with the conventional transplantation assay (<a href=\"#bib67\">Rossi and Gonzalez, 2015</a>) with only 16% (n=20) of VNCs developing large tumors in the abdomen of transplanted animals after 7 days, compared to 84% (n=32) with <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup></i> VNCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). We also assessed the mitotic index of the Chinmo<sup>+</sup> and Chinmo<sup>-</sup> dNBs present within the same <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup></i> tumor. We found that it was significantly higher for the subpopulation of Chinmo<sup>+</sup> dNBs than for Chinmo<sup>-</sup> dNBs suggesting that two types of progenitors with different mitotic potential co-exist in tumors (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Because adult flies containing <i>UAS-chinmo</i> clones rapidly die, we could not test the long-term growth potential of <i>UAS-chinmo</i> NB tumors. To circumvent this problem, we transplanted larval VNCs over-expressing Chinmo in all NBs (<i>nab&gt;chinmo</i>). We found that 26% of transplanted flies grow large tumors in the abdomen after <b>7</b> days (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) showing that Chinmo over-expression in NBs and their GMCs is sufficient to induce sustained tumorigenic growth. Together, these data demonstrate that aberrant Chinmo expression in a subset of dNBs is oncogenic and drives sustained tumor growth beyond developmental stages."

Interestingly, in larval and adult <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup> </i>tumors, both Imp and Lin-28 are present in the cytoplasm of the subset of dNBs that co-express Chinmo (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

In such conditions, <i>pox<sup>n</sup>&gt;pros<sup>RNAi</sup></i> tumors grow extensively and invade the central brain and optic lobes, while <i>pox<sup>n</sup>&gt;pros<sup>RNAi</sup>, Imp<sup>RNAi1;2</sup> </i>tumors remain much smaller, stay localized to the VNC and show an almost complete loss of Chinmo<sup>+</sup> dNBs (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). We also noted a tendency for an increased number of Chinmo<sup>+</sup> dNBs in 4 day-old adults upon Imp over-expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, not quantified). These experiments indicate that Imp is not required to establish the initial population of Chinmo<sup>+</sup> dNBs but is necessary for their long-term maintenance in tumors. Together with the transcriptional activation of Imp by Chinmo, these experiments reveal a positive feedback loop between Chinmo and Imp necessary for sustained tumor growth beyond developmental stages."

This suggests that Lin-28 is dispensable for Chinmo expression and for sustained tumor growth. However, while mis-expression of <i>Drosophila lin-28</i> in <i>wt</i> larval NB clones is not sufficient to induce NB amplification and ectopic expression of Chinmo and Imp (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we find that overexpression of <i>Drosophila lin-28</i> in <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup></i> tumors from their initiation leads to a significant increase in the proportion of Chinmo<sup>+</sup> dNBs and an overall increase in the intensity of Chinmo expression when observed in 6 day-old adults (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Moreover, Imp is co-expressed in all Chinmo<sup>+</sup> dNBs. This suggests that overexpression of Lin-28 in the tumorigenic context is able to favor the self-renewing capacity of Chinmo<sup>+</sup>/Imp<sup>+</sup> dNBs at the expense of Chinmo<sup>-</sup>/Imp<sup>-</sup> dNBs. Interestingly, overexpression of mammalian LIN28A and LIN28B is often associated with malignant tumors in human (<a href=\"#bib16\">Carmel-Gross et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Molenaar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Viswanathan et al., 2009</a>). Remarkably, human LIN28A and LIN28B, mis-expressed in <i>Drosophila pox<sup>n</sup>&gt;pros<sup>RNAi</sup></i> tumors, have retained the ability to strongly enhance Chinmo expression within tumors, demonstrating evolutionary-conserved interactions between Lin-28 and Chinmo or its regulators (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). All together, these data identifies Chinmo and Imp as a core oncogenic module that sustains dNB proliferation and tumor growth beyond developmental stages. In addition, expression of this module is boosted by high levels of Lin-28 in tumors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Interestingly, in the VNC and central brain, both Imp and Lin-28 are co-expressed with Chinmo in normal NBs and their surrounding neuronal progeny from L1 to early L3. From early L3, they are then progressively downregulated together with Chinmo in NBs and subsequent progeny (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Lin-28 and Chinmo remain transiently expressed in early-born neurons up to midL3 and early pupal stages respectively, while Imp expression in early-born neurons perdures in adult (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, <i>Imp</i> and <i>lin-28</i>, like <i>chinmo</i>, fail to be silenced in late larval and adult NBs with a stalled temporal series (<i>svp<sup>-/-</sup></i>), as well as in their progeny (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Thus, the temporal system silences <i>chinmo</i>, <i>Imp</i> and <i>lin-28</i> in L3 NBs. We then tested the function of Chinmo in NBs during development. <i>chinmo<sup>-/-</sup></i> MARCM clones were induced during embryogenesis in order to ensure the removal of Chinmo during the entire post-embryonic period (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). In <i>chinmo<sup>-/-</sup> </i>late L3 clones, we did not observe a difference in clone size in the VNC compared to the control <i>wt</i> clones (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) and <i>chinmo<sup>-/-</sup></i> NBs exhibit the same mitotic rate and possess the same size as <i>wt</i> NBs in late L3 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). Thus Chinmo is dispensable for NB growth and proliferation during larval development. We then tested whether temporally blocked NBs persist in adults due to the maintenance of Chinmo, Imp and Lin-28. Knocking-down Chinmo in temporally stalled <i>svp<sup>-/-</sup></i> NBs is not sufficient to prevent adult persistence, although NB growth is impaired (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). However, knocking down both Chinmo and Imp in <i>svp<sup>-/-</sup></i> NBs restores their elimination before adulthood (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>). This suggests that the Chinmo/Imp module is necessary to maintain the unlimited mitotic potential of NBs stalled in an early temporal identity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). Together with our results showing that over-expression of Chinmo is sufficient to induce persistence of NBs in adults (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), these experiments also indicate that silencing of <i>Imp</i> and <i>chinmo</i> by the temporal patterning system may be necessary to limit NB mitotic activity and schedule the competency for NB terminal differentiation during metamorphosis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>)."

L1/L2-induced <i>pros<sup>-/-</sup></i> clones persist in 100% of adults and rapidly progress to cover the totality of the VNCs (n&gt;100). In contrast, midL3-induced tumors persist in only 36.4% of adult VNCs (n = 19) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), and make an average of 0.63 persisting tumor per adult VNC (SEM = 0.23), deriving from an average of 13.5 tumors per larval VNCs (n= 16, SEM = 1). These rare persisting tumors (4,7%) in adult VNCs remain small, containing no more than 100 dNBs. Thus, most midL3-induced tumors differentiated during metamorphosis, and the few tumors that persist in adults possess a limited growth potential (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). This limited growth potential of midL3-induced tumors was also observed when larvae were maintained in the sterol-free diet for 7 days after induction. In such conditions, midL3-induced tumors rapidly stop growing, with many dNBs progressively losing GFP expression, suggesting reduced transcriptional activity, and exhibiting reduced mitotic index and cytoplasmic extensions typical of quiescent NBs indicating a progressive exhaustion of their mitotic potential (<a href=\"#bib18\">Chell and Brand, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Truman and Bate, 1988</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s2\">2A,B</a>).

In contrast, L1/L2-induced tumors remain highly proliferative leading to massive dNB tumors covering the whole CNS (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Together these results indicate that malignant <i>pros<sup>-/-</sup></i> tumors can only be induced if they are initiated during an early window of development (before midL3) while NBs and their progeny express the CIL module. In contrast, dNBs induced by the dedifferentiation of late-born CIL-negative GMCs cannot reactivate Chinmo expression, possess\u00a0a limited proliferation potential and undergo terminal differentiation during metamorphosis like <i>wt</i> NBs, or persist as benign, slow-growing, tumors in adults."

Alternatively, absence of CIL reactivation in late-induced tumors could be due to a non-permissive microenvironment subsequent to developmental progression. To distinguish these possibilities, we combined the GAL80<sup>ts</sup> system (<a href=\"#bib58\">McGuire et al., 2004</a>) and MARCM to temporally control the induction of <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup></i> tumors in <i>svp<sup>-/-</sup></i> NB clones blocked in an early temporal identity. Loss of Svp was induced in L1 by a 45\u2009min heat-shock. Then larvae were kept at 18\u00b0C in the control experiment, or switched to\u00a029\u00b0C from late L3 or pupal stages for late induction of <i>pros<sup>RNAi</sup></i>. While adult flies raised at 18\u00b0C possess a single NB per clone due to the early loss of Svp, flies raised at 29\u00b0C from L3 or pupal stages contain large tumors of CIL<sup>+</sup> dNBs in their VNCs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>). Thus, the GMCs of NBs blocked in an early temporal identity remain predisposed to generate CIL<sup>+</sup> malignant tumors independently of the developmental stage. These results demonstrate that the malignant potential of a neural cell undergoing dedifferentiation is dictated by its temporal identity, and blocking temporal factor progression in NBs extends the window of malignant susceptibility."

The core components of the module involve the BTB transcription factor Chinmo and the mRNA-binding protein Imp. Chinmo and Imp positively cross-regulate at the transcriptional and translational level respectively. We find that Chinmo is a proto-oncogene that is able to promote the transcription of a large set of genes that boost protein synthesis and cell-cycle progression, and is also a strong repressor of neural differentiation. Consequently, over-expression of Chinmo in NBs and GMCs, but not in neurons (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zhu et al., 2006</a>), is sufficient to cause NB amplification and tumor growth. This is consistent with a previously identified oncogenic activity of Chinmo when expressed in the hematopoietic and imaginal disc precursors (<a href=\"#bib24\">Doggett et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Flaherty et al., 2010</a>). In contrast, Imp mis-expression is not sufficient to trigger NB amplification but Imp is necessary to maintain <i>pros<sup>-/-</sup></i> tumor growth beyond developmental stages, at least partly by allowing/sustaining Chinmo expression. Another mRNA-binding protein, Lin-28, is also positively regulated by Chinmo in tumors. We found that Lin-28 is however dispensable for tumor growth although Lin-28 over-expression enhances the proportion of Chinmo+ dNBs in tumors. Thus Lin-28 overexpression may promote the self-renewal of Chinmo<sup>+</sup>, Imp<sup>+</sup> dNBs and therefore increase the growth potential of the tumor. This role is consistent with the observation that high expression of LIN28 isoforms in human tumors\u00a0promotes tumor growth (<a href=\"#bib74\">Viswanathan et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, a recent RIP-seq analysis in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos has uncovered both Imp and chinmo mRNAs among the most highly enriched targets of Lin-28 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Chen et al., 2015a</a>), and mammalian Imp and Lin-28 orthologs share many common RNA targets (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). Thus, Imp and Lin-28 may also directly co-regulate Chinmo translation in tumors. Further investigation is required to identify all components and the regulatory principles of this oncogenic network."

Moreover, NBs blocked in an early temporal identity fail to persist in adults if lacking Imp and Chinmo. Thus, our results suggests that the silencing of Chinmo and Imp in early L3 by the temporal series is a way to limit the mitotic potential of NBs and ensure their timely termination during pupal stages. The role of Lin-28 in regulating NB mitotic activity during development is still unknown, but in mice, Imp1/Igf2bp1 and Lin28a/b are co-expressed in fetal cortical progenitors where they post-transcriptionally regulate growth genes involved in the PI3K/TOR pathway (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). This suggests an evolutionary conserved growth-promoting role of these factors during neural development. Moreover, Lin28a and Imp1 are downregulated in mammals before birth (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). This temporal pattern of expression is reminiscent to what is observed in NBs during <i>Drosophila</i> larval stages and suggests that the growth dynamic of fetal NSCs in mammals and larval NBs are controlled by evolutionary conserved gene networks. However, whether an analogous temporal transcription factor series in mammals similarly regulates Imp1 and Lin28a/b remains to be demonstrated."

This indicates that regulatory mechanisms upstream of <i>chinmo</i> and <i>Imp</i> may be different in normal NBs (the temporal series) and in dNBs after co-option."

GMCs born during this early developmental window can generate malignant tumors upon loss of Pros. In contrast, GMCs born after the early window generate benign tumors that either completely differentiate during metamorphosis, demonstrating sensitivity to the growth-terminating cues operating in pupae, or persist in adults but fail to consistently grow, demonstrating a limited growth potential. Blocking progression of the temporal patterning system from early larval stages extends the window of susceptibility and late-born GMCs remain prone to malignant transformation, up to (and possibly beyond) metamorphosis. Our clonal analysis indicates that this window of malignant susceptibility correspond to the temporal window of expression of Chinmo and Imp. All together, our data strongly suggest that it is the presence of an activated Chinmo/Imp module in the cell (GMC) of origin that confers malignant potential. Thus, the temporal patterning regulates malignant susceptibility, at least partly, through the temporal control of Chinmo and Imp in newly-born GMCs during neurogenesis. Whether embryonic GMCs are prone to malignant transformation, like early larval GMCs, remains unclear. We could not in our various assays limit the loss of Pros to embryonically-born GMCs. This question therefore requires further investigation."

First, inactivation of genes that govern the terminal differentiation of intermediate progenitors or immature neurons triggers exponential NSC amplification. Second, if occurring at an early developmental stage, this dedifferentiation process interferes with the NSC-encoded temporal program that normally limits mitotic potential by silencing genes like Chinmo, Imp and Lin-28 in <i>Drosophila</i>. As a result, Chinmo, Imp and Lin-28 (or their analogs in humans) are co-opted in dedifferentiated cells to unleash an early mode of growth that is resistant to differentiation cues during late development and sufficient to sustain unlimited NSC amplification and malignant progression. In contrast to tumors initiated during adulthood, the cells of origin (CIL<sup>+</sup> GMCs in the case of <i>pros<sup>-/-</sup></i> tumors) already express the early oncogenic modules that are sufficient to sustain rapid growth. Consequently, early-induced tumors do not need to accumulate novel mutations to progress to malignancy. In contrast, later-born neural cells that have already silenced proto-oncogenic, modules may require the accumulation of more genetic and epigenetic alterations for the reestablishment of oncogenic combinations causing malignancy. All together, our data uncovers the developmental program regulating the malignant susceptibility of neural cells in <i>Drosophila</i>, and provides a model that may help to unveil the molecular basis underlying the rapid malignant growth of neural tumors with early developmental origins."

Cone cells are among the earliest progeny to be generated by retinal progenitors (from E12 to E16 in mice) and their birth-order is dictated by a series of sequentially expressed temporal transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib55\">Mattar et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Young, 1985</a>).

The poly-A<sup>+</sup> RNAs were fragmented and reverse transcribed using random hexamers, Super Script II (Life Technologies, ref. 18064\u2013014, Waltham, MA) and Actinomycin D. During the second strand generation step, dUTP substitued dTTP. This prevents the second strand to be used as a matrix during the final PCR amplification. Double stranded cDNAs were adenylated at their 3' ends before ligation was performed using Illumia's indexed adapters. Ligated cDNAs were amplified following 15 cycles PCR and PCR products were purified using AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, ref.A63881, Brea, CA). Libraries were validated using a DNA1000 chip (Agilent, ref. 5067\u20131504, Santa Clara, CA) on a Agilent Bioanalyzer and quantified using the KAPA Library quantification kit (Clinisciences, ref. KK4824). Four libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts per lane and sequencing was performed on an HiSeq2000 using the single read protocol (50nt)."

The quality of the data was assessed using FastQC from the Babraham Institute and the Illumina software SAV (Sequence Analysis Viewer). Demultiplexing was performed using Illumina's sequencing analysis software (CASAVA 1.8.2). A splice junction mapper, TopHat 2.0.9 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kim et al., 2013</a>) (using Bowtie 2.1.0 [<a href=\"#bib47\">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</a>]), was used to align RNA-Seq reads to the Drosophila melanogaster genome (UCSC dm3) with a set of gene model annotations (genes.gtf downloaded from UCSC on March 6 2013). Final read alignments having more than 3 mismatches were discarded. Then, the gene counting was performed using HTSeq count 0.5.3p9 (union mode) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anders et al., 2014</a>). The data is from a strand-specific assay, the read has to be mapped to the opposite strand of the gene. Before statistical analysis, genes with less than 15 reads (cumulating all the analyzed samples) were filtered and thus removed. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the Bioconductor (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gentleman et al., 2004</a>) package DESeq (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anders and Huber, 2010</a>) 1.14.0. Data were normalized using the DESeq normalization method. Genes with adjusted p<i>-</i>value to less than 5% (according to the FDR method from Benjamini-Hochberg) were declared differentially expressed. To perform the functional analysis of the resulting list of genes with the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, the topGO (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexa et al., 2006</a>) package from Bioconductor was used. Overrepresented GO terms were identified using Fisher's exact test with the weight method. As confidence threshold we used a p-value of 1%. To realize this analysis the differentially expressed genes were compared with those of all known genes present in the annotation. The GO categories were found in the Org.Dm.eg.db package (Carlson) based on the gene reporter EntrezGeneID. Gene Ontology and Kegg pathway analysis were performed using Flymine (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lyne et al., 2007</a>). Raw RNA-seq data are available in the Gene Expression omnibus database (accession number: GSE64405)."

Moreover, the authors present data that support a conserved role for Chinmo, Lin-28 and Imp for competency of progenitor cells to undergo malignant transformation. This is a novel and elegant study of broad interest, but there is room for improvement. The results are somewhat obscured by the fact that the paper is rather long and the genetics quite complex.

However, I have two related concerns about the Discussion that arise from an inaccurate comparison with \"oncogene addition\" and the claim that chinmo is the functional ortholog of Nmyc. Regarding oncogene addiction, this idea was first put forth more than a decade ago (see Torti 2011 EMBO Mol Med 3, 623-636), and one key component of this theory is that when the oncogene is removed/silenced in the tumor cell, that cell dies. This is not observed when chinmo is removed from the tumors. They tumors are smaller when chinmo is removed (because they proliferate less) but there are no data to suggest that the dNb lacking chinmo dies. Therefore, their data are more consistent with chinmo being a cancer stem cell gene and not an addictive oncogene. I strongly suggest that this part of the Discussion is edited."

I have strong reservations about this entire section and find it na\u00efve. First, chinmo and Nmyc have no structural/sequence similarity and they don't share the same domain structure. So this basis for their claim is not compelling. Most of the argument is based upon the observation that many genes involved in ribosome biogenesis are upregulated in dNbs, and this serves as the tenuous link between chinmo and Nmyc. In flies, myc (dm) upregulates ribosome biogenesis by upregulating Tif-1A (Grewal Nat Cell Biol 2003). Does chinmo also upregulate Tif-1A? Does chinmo upregulate myc/dm? The authors need to provide compelling data to support their argument or they need to tone down the speculation."

Plenty of data exist to contradict this assertion, and the citations the authors use do not support this assertion (Kaatch is an epidemology review, and Vogelstein is a review about cancer genomics in general). For example, several experimental mouse models of MB show that tumors can arise post-natally, and the peak ages of incidence for MB is 3-5 and 8-9 years of age (diagnoses of children under 1 year of age are uncommon). The origins of these tumors is very much an active area of investigation. The similarities between the tumor cells and fetal/embryonic stem cells should not be construed to mean that these tumors therefore arise from fetal/embryonic cell types. Indeed, the term \"embryonal\" is not really meant to refer to these tumors' origins, but rather is a pathology term that refers to their common histological and immunohistochemical features: cells within these tumors show specific similarities to each other and to immature cells in their tissues of origin. Again, the authors misconstrue medical terminology and basic science terminology. This section of the Discussion should be re-written to de-emphasize that such tumors obligately arise from embryonic/fetal stages, and should be written to be more broadly inclusive of childhood tumors, which are thought to arise both pre- and post-natally."

Therefore, the possible contribution of transplantation to malignancy remains unclear. It therefore seemed important to us to design an assay in which early developmental tumors can be precisely tracked, to investigate how their differentiating, proliferative and invasive properties may evolve over several days/weeks, throughout development (in the case of transplantation, usually larval tumors are directly transplanted in adults) and in their natural environment with no mechanic interventions."

However, I have two related concerns about the Discussion that arise from an inaccurate comparison with \"oncogene addition\" and the claim that chinmo is the functional ortholog of Nmyc. Regarding oncogene addiction, this idea was first put forth more than a decade ago (see Torti 2011 EMBO Mol Med 3, 623-636), and one key component of this theory is that when the oncogene is removed/silenced in the tumor cell, that cell dies. This is not observed when chinmo is removed from the tumors. They tumors are smaller when chinmo is removed (because they proliferate less) but there are no data to suggest that the dNb lacking chinmo dies. Therefore, their data are more consistent with chinmo being a cancer stem cell gene and not an addictive oncogene. I strongly suggest that this part of the Discussion is edited.</i>"

So this basis for their claim is not compelling. Most of the argument is based upon the observation that many genes involved in ribosome biogenesis are upregulated in dNbs, and this serves as the tenuous link between chinmo and Nmyc. In flies, myc (dm) upregulates ribosome biogenesis by upregulating Tif-1A (Grewal Nat Cell Biol 2003). Does chinmo also upregulate Tif-1A? Does chinmo upregulate myc/dm? The authors need to provide compelling data to support their argument or they need to tone down the speculation.</i>"

Plenty of data exist to contradict this assertion, and the citations the authors use do not support this assertion (Kaatch is an epidemology review, and Vogelstein is a review about cancer genomics in general). For example, several experimental mouse models of MB show that tumors can arise post-natally, and the peak ages of incidence for MB is 3-5 and 8-9 years of age (diagnoses of children under 1 year of age are uncommon). The origins of these tumors is very much an active area of investigation. The similarities between the tumor cells and fetal/embryonic stem cells should not be construed to mean that these tumors therefore arise from fetal/embryonic cell types. Indeed, the term \"embryonal\" is not really meant to refer to these tumors' origins, but rather is a pathology term that refers to their common histological and immunohistochemical features: cells within these tumors show specific similarities to each other and to immature cells in their tissues of origin. Again, the authors misconstrue medical terminology and basic science terminology.
