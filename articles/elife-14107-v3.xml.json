We have characterized ligand-induced dimerization and multimerization of EGFR using single-molecule analysis, and show that multimerization can be blocked by mutations in a specific region of Domain IV of the extracellular module. These mutations reduce autophosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of EGFR and attenuate phosphorylation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase, which is recruited by EGFR. The catalytic activity of EGFR is switched on through allosteric activation of one kinase domain by another, and we show that if this is restricted to dimers, then sites in the tail that are proximal to the kinase domain are phosphorylated in only one subunit. We propose a structural model for EGFR multimerization through self-association of ligand-bound dimers, in which the majority of kinase domains are activated cooperatively, thereby boosting tail phosphorylation."

We have characterized ligand-induced dimerization and multimerization of EGFR using single-molecule analysis, and show that multimerization can be blocked by mutations in a specific region of Domain IV of the extracellular module. These mutations reduce autophosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of EGFR and attenuate phosphorylation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase, which is recruited by EGFR. The catalytic activity of EGFR is switched on through allosteric activation of one kinase domain by another, and we show that if this is restricted to dimers, then sites in the tail that are proximal to the kinase domain are phosphorylated in only one subunit. We propose a structural model for EGFR multimerization through self-association of ligand-bound dimers, in which the majority of kinase domains are activated cooperatively, thereby boosting tail phosphorylation."

Human EGFR is one of four closely related receptors that form homodimeric or heterodimeric combinations (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001</a>). EGFR and one other member of the family (human epidermal growth factor receptor 4, HER4, also known as ErbB4) bind to specific ligands, and respond by activating their intracellular kinase domains. The two other members of the family, HER2 and HER3, are potent signaling receptors in combination, with HER3 switching on the kinase activity of HER2 in response to ligand binding (<a href=\"#bib11\">Citri et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sliwkowski et al., 1994</a>). Aberrant signaling from EGFR family members underlies the onset of many cancers, and there is intense interest in understanding how these receptors are regulated (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lynch et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Paez et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pao et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Slamon et al., 2001</a>)."

Dimerization activates the intracellular kinase domains of the receptor, resulting in autophosphorylation of a ~230 residue C-terminal tail and the initiation of downstream signaling (<a href=\"#bib43\">Margolis et al., 1989</a>). The extracellular module of EGFR consists of four domains, denoted Domains I, II, III and IV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>). Domains I and III form the ligand-binding site of the receptor (<a href=\"#bib22\">Garrett et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ogiso et al., 2002</a>). Domain II, which bridges the ligand-binding domains, contains a 'dimerization arm' that interacts with the corresponding element in the other subunit in a dimer (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dawson et al., 2005</a>). Domains I, II and III form a compact unit that we refer to as the 'head' of the extracellular module, of which Domain IV forms an elongated 'leg'. In the absence of ligand, the extracellular module adopts a tethered and autoinhibited conformation, in which the dimerization arm is buried between the head and the leg (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ferguson et al., 2003</a>). Ligand binding converts the receptor to a straightened form, releasing the dimerization arm, which then interacts to form a back-to-back dimer in which ligands do not participate directly in the inter-subunit interfaces."

These mutations attenuate the phosphorylation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which binds to Tyr 992 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jones et al., 2006</a>). In contrast, the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which is activated by distal phosphorylation of EGFR (<a href=\"#bib5\">Batzer et al., 1994</a>), is not affected by these mutations. Our data suggest that this differential effect on proximal phosphorylation may arise from the structure of the asymmetric dimer of kinase domains, in which the proximal sites on the activator kinase cannot reach the active site of the receiver kinase, and would therefore be poorly phosphorylated in isolated dimers. We speculate that multimerization results in the formation of chains of kinase domains, in which the majority of kinase domains would be stabilized in the active form, allowing stronger phosphorylation in general, and more complete phosphorylation of proximal sites <i>in cis</i>."

This resulted in an increase in the fraction of two-step photobleaching events, from ~3% to ~9% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The increase in apparent dimerization upon deletion of the dimerization arm is unexpected, given that that this element forms a major part of the extracellular dimer interface. A possible explanation is that the dimerization arm is also important for maintaining the tethered and autoinhibited conformation of the extracellular module, and deletion of the dimerization arm is expected to release autoinhibition, and thereby facilitate dimerization (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ferguson et al., 2003</a>). To test this idea we introduced mutations on the other side of the tethered interaction, which is in Domain IV rather than in the dimerization arm of Domain II. We introduced two point mutations (D563A, H566A) and also deleted a loop (residues 575 to 585) in Domain IV. A similar mutation in EGFR has been shown to abolish the tethering interaction (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dawson et al., 2007</a>). This mutation, which we refer to as \u0394-tether, has the dimerization arm intact, and it also increases the fraction of two-step bleaching events (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These results are consistent with the accepted view, which is that the autoinhibited conformation of the extracellular domain provides a steric block to dimerization (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ferguson et al., 2003</a>). Once this block is released, the extended shape of the extracellular module permits dimerization even if the dimerization arm is deleted."

This construct was studied by photobleaching, and it exhibited one-step and two-step photobleaching, with no evidence for multistep photobleaching (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We conclude that the transmembrane helices do not form multimers by themselves at the low expression levels used in our experiments. An interesting aspect of these data is that the extent of dimerization for the isolated transmembrane helices (~13%) is greater than that seen for full-length EGFR (~3%) without EGF (compare <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figures 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

Diffusion constants extracted from the data support the conclusion that the IIIV/KKRE mutation impairs the ability of EGFR to form higher-order multimers upon binding EGF (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

The red line represents the median value of the distribution, with the box enclosing the 25\u201375 percentile and the whiskers the entire distribution. Outliers are indicated by a red cross. (<b>A</b>) Data for control constructs, shown schematically at the top of the panel. These constructs are localized to the membrane by a thirteen residue N-terminal sequence from c-Src, and have either EGFP or mCherry fused to the C-terminus, as described (<a href=\"#bib18\">Endres et al., 2013</a>). A multimer control, Src<sub>13</sub>-GCN4-EGFRk, is a construct with the coiled-coil segment of GCN4 joined to the N-terminus of the kinase domain of EGFR. The dimer control, Src<sub>13</sub>-GCN4, contains just the coiled-coil segment of GCN4 in addition to the membrane tag and the fluorescent protein. The monomer control, Src<sub>16</sub>, contains only the membrane localization sequence and the flurescent protein. Note that the cross-correlation values for multimeric Src<sub>13</sub>-GCN4-EGFRk are higher than that for the dimer control, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib44\">Marita et al., 2015</a>). (PIE-FCCS data for these controls were collected previously on the same instrument, and are reproduced here with permission.) (<b>B</b>) Relative cross-correlation values for full-length EGFR constructs, with and without the addition of EGF: EGFR, wild-type EGFR; and EGFR-IIIV/KKRE, an EGFR quadruple mutant (I545K, I556K, I562R and V592E). (<b>C</b>) Protein mobility from PIE-FCCS data. The mobility of each construct in the plasma membrane is directly measured with PIE-FCCS and converted to an effective diffusion coefficient for comparison. The diffusion coefficients of EGFR and EGFR-IIIV/KKRE before ligand stimulation are 0.46 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.52 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s respectively ( \u00b1 standard error). These values are consistent with monomeric, single pass transmembrane proteins in the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib44\">Marita et al., 2015</a>). Upon stimulation with EGF, the diffusion coefficient of EGFR-IIIV/KKRE drops to 0.40 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s, consistent with a monomer-dimer transition. For wild-type EGFR, EGF stimulation causes the diffusion coefficient to be\u00a0reduced\u00a0significantly more than for\u00a0the mutant, to 0.28 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s, consistent with the formation of multimers."

In that study, we had assumed that a construct in which the intracellular module (ICM) of EGFR was fused to GCN4 (GCN4-ICM) corresponded to a dimer. The current data show that GCN4-ICM forms multimers, because the cross-correlation value for this construct, <i>f<sub>c</sub></i> = 0.23, is significantly higher than for the dimer control, <i>f<sub>c</sub></i> = 0.13, and slightly higher than for EGF-bound EGFR, = 0.19.

The mutations that we have identified in Domain IV of EGFR that block multimerization, but not dimerization, provide an opportunity to identify the effects of multimerization on EGFR function. To test the effect of these mutations on the activity of EGFR, we used transient transfection in mammalian cells (HEK293T), followed by measurement of phosphorylation on EGFR and downstream signaling effector proteins by FACS assay, as described (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kovacs et al., 2015b</a>).

Phosphorylation of Tyr 1173 clearly occurs in both receiver and activator tails, with higher efficiency for the activator tail (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), which is consistent with our previous study. For Tyr 992, in the proximal part of the tail, the phosphorylation level in the activator tail is much lower compared to that in the receiver tail (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Tyr 992, in the proximal part of the tail, can only access its own kinase domain in an asymmetric dimer (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koland, 2014</a>). In a combination of receiver-impaired and activator-impaired EGFR molecules, the activator kinase domain is not itself activated, and so Tyr 992 in the activator tail cannot be phosphorylated efficiently.

The components of the model are the known dimeric arrangements of the extracellular module, the transmembrane helices and the kinase domains, which are connected together to produce a model for dimeric full-length EGFR, as described (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arkhipov et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Endres et al., 2013</a>). We then modeled tetramers of EGFR by packing the dimers against each other as rigid bodies. This model is simply a useful construct for considering how tetramerization might occur, and is not based on detailed energy calculations. Also, the limited set of mutations we have made does not allow us to conclude definitively that the residues that we have identified as being important are responsible for a direct and stereospecific interaction between dimers.

The principal difference between these is that the EGFR extracellular module is closed, with the C-terminal tips of the extracellular module are close together, whereas in HER4 they are separated. These differences reflect an intrinsic flexibility in the extracellular module, rather than fundamental difference between EGFR and HER4, as shown by molecular dynamics simulations of EGFR (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arkhipov et al., 2013a</a>). We found that a closed structure, with the tips of Domain IV close together, is more suitable for the generation of multimers in which each subunit retains connection to a planar membrane (see <a href=\"#fig11s2\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The ligand-bound heads of the receptors (Domains I to III) are stacked in a parallel arrangement, with a Domain IV leg from one dimer interacting with a Domain IV leg from the other. These dimers are open structures, and higher-order multimers can be formed readily by adding additional dimers through propagation of the Domain IV-Domain IV interaction.

In structures of active EGFR (e.g., PDB Code 2GS6), the rotation between subsequent kinase domains in a chain is 120\u00b0. If this rotation is preserved, then the juxtamembrane dimer has to be broken in the third dimer in order to connect to the transmembrane helices. We note that there are structures of the EGFR, HER2 and HER4 kinase domains in inactive conformations in which chains of asymmetric dimers are formed (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aertgeerts et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Qiu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Red Brewer et al., 2009</a>). In these chains, the rotation between adjacent kinase domains is 90\u00b0, rather than 120\u00b0, due to rotation of the N-lobe of the kinase domain with respect to the C-lobe. This intrinsic flexibility in the kinase domain may allow maintenance of the juxtamembrane interactions along the chain, but we have not investigated this further."

Such coupling may explain the critical importance of the transmembrane dimer for multimerization. In the Xenopus oocyte assay, we found that disruption of the transmembrane dimer interface resulted in a substantial reduction in the extent of multimerization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In contrast, the deletion of the dimerization arm in the extracellular module (\u0394-arm) had very little effect. In terms of its effect on activity, EGFR that is mutated in the transmembrane helix behaves similarly to EGFR with Domain IV mutations that block multimerization, with strong inhibition of PI3K phosphorylation, and only a mild effect on ERK phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Deletion of the dimerization arm compromises EGFR function in a more general way, blocking both PI3K and ERK phosphorylation (not shown). This differential effect of mutations in the transmembrane helices on proximal versus distal sites may explain why it has been difficult to observe strong effects on EGFR activity by disrupting transmembrane dimerization (<a href=\"#bib18\">Endres et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lu et al., 2010</a>)."

Examination of the Domain IV multimerization interface shows that although there are changes in the identity of residues within this region, the general hydrophobicity of residues in this surface region is conserved. For heterodimers of HER2 and HER3, an interesting possibility is that a tetramer could have two HER2 kinase domains sandwiched between HER3 kinase domains. The HER2 tail is similar in sequence to that of EGFR, and is likely to be subject to the same constraints on the phosphorylation of proximal sites. The HER3 tail is distinctive, and includes a ~70 residue long spacer between the kinase domain and the first phosphorylation site, making HER3 less dependent on a specific organization of kinase domains for phosphorylation. The first HER2 kinase domain would be activated by HER3, and would serve as the activator for the second HER2 kinase domain. Multimerization has been shown to be important for the phosphorylation of HER2 in HER2-HER3 heterodimers (<a href=\"#bib79\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>), and the simultaneous activation of two HER2 kinase domains in a tetramer might account for this."

More importantly, we found that ligand-induced receptor self-association does not end at dimerization, but continues with the generation of multimers. While the existence of higher-order ligand-induced multimers of EGFR has been reported before (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clayton et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">2008</a>), our identification of residues in Domain IV that specifically affect multimerization rather than dimerization has allowed us to uncover a functional role of multimerization in EGFR activation. The long C-terminal tail of EGFR has two kinds of phosphorylation sites. Those that are distal to the kinase domain (e.g., Tyr 1068, and Tyr 1173, which recruit the adaptor proteins GRB2 and SHC) are phosphorylated more efficiently than those in the proximal part of the tail (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koland, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kovacs et al., 2015b</a>).

In IRE1, the chaining of kinase domains occurs in a back-to-front manner, whereas in EGFR our model has the kinase domains chained in a head to tail fashion, generating a continuous array of activator and receiver kinase domains.

However, the efficient activation of EGFR and the initiation of signaling pathways on the cell membrane involves dynamic interactions between intact receptors and their surroundings, including membranes, adaptor proteins, effector proteins, and the cytoskeleton. The multimerization of EGFR may be crucial for signaling in this environment, since it increases the effective density of docking sites for downstream adaptor proteins. These adaptors are typically multivalent, and their docking could synergize with EGFR multimerization, leading to larger-scale clusters. The formation of such signaling platforms may be a central aspect of maintaining the balance between ligand-induced activation and inactivation by receptor internalization, phosphatases or ubiquitin ligases, and will continue to serve as a focus of intense study."

For initial docking, we excluded the Domain IV 'leg' so that docking was carried out using just the Domains I, II and III 'head' regions. We then used Cluspro to dock the entire extracellular domain against itself, with the added constraint that the residues identified by mutation studies to play a role in oligomerization (Val 526, Glu 527, Asn 528, Ile 545, Thr 548, Asn 554 and Ile 556) are at the interface. We manually filtered the ClusPro solutions using three criteria: (i) the C-terminal ends of both dimers must point towards to same plane, (ii) the rotation between the dimers must be small enough to permit the multimer to be extended while retaining connection to the same plane and (iii) documented sites of glycosylation (<a href=\"#bib81\">Zhen et al., 2003</a>) should not be buried at the interface. Application of these filters yielded a family of 6 models that differed from each other only with respect to the tilt and rotation between two dimeric units. We chose a representative one to construct a model for a tetramer of full-length EGFR."

The existence of these higher order complexes have been described previously but their function, existence, and significance have been questioned and ill defined. Part of the conundrum was due to our increased understanding of EGFR structure and function that has been gained since 2002. The field now has a detailed appreciation of extracellular and intracellular interactions that contribute to EGFR activation. However, the observation of higher order complexes complicated the interpretation of this elegant structural understanding. The present study enlightens the field as to the structural basis for these higher order complexes. In summary, this manuscript reports on some very important findings and will contribute to our basic understanding of EGFR signaling."

Yet, given that it is not based on detailed energy calculations, it must certainly be inaccurate. It would be better to remove all but the bottom right cartoon in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>."

This issue concerned whether the mutations we had made had affected the surface display and trafficking of the receptor (Point No. 4 in the list of essential points, below). As the reviewers point out, if the mutations affect the surface expression of EGFR, then the reduction in EGF- induced activity would be difficult to interpret. We are pleased to report that we carried out new experiments that addressed this issue for one of the key mutations (denoted II/KK) for which we show a reduction in activity, and we demonstrate that there is no effect on surface expression of EGFR. Briefly, we made a construct of EGFR which has an HA tag at the N-terminus of the extracellular domain, and has the fluorescent protein Venus fused to the C-terminal end. We detected surface expression by addition of an HA-specific antibody to intact live cells. We then fixed the cells and examined them by fluorescence microscopy, and quantitated the ratio of surface-expressed EGFR to total EGFR (monitored by Venus fluorescence). There is no discernible difference in this ratio between wild-type EGFR and mutant EGFR. These data are now included in the discussion of the effects of Domain IV mutations on EGFR activity (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Sean Peterson, who carried out these new experiments, is now included as a co-author of the revised manuscript."

Additional PIE-FCCS data on the constructs reported in our original submission have been measured, and these data are shown as <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> in the revised manuscript. In addition, diffusion constants have now been extracted from PIE-FCCS data, and are included as a new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>. The mobility of each construct in the plasma membrane is directly measured with PIE-FCCS and is converted to an effective diffusion coefficient, D<sub>eff</sub>, for comparison. The diffusion coefficients of EGFR and EGFR-IIIV/KKRE before ligand stimulation are 0.60 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.59 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s respectively ( \u00b1 standard error). These values are consistent with monomeric, single-pass transmembrane proteins in the plasma membrane (Marita et al., Biophys J, 2015, PMID: 26536270). Upon stimulation with EGF, the diffusion coefficient of EGFR-IIIV/KKRE drops to 0.52 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcm<sup><a href=\"#bib2\">2</a></sup>/s, consistent with a monomer-dimer transition. For wild-type EGFR, EGF stimulation causes the diffusion coefficient to drop to 0.36 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcm<sup><a href=\"#bib2\">2</a></sup>/s. This drop is significantly more than seen in the mutant and consistent with the formation of multimers. Finally, the PIE- FCCS data have been displayed in an alternative way to help the reader understand these data better (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, also shown below)."

The first is a single point mutation (Lys 454 to Glu) in Domain III, at a location predicted to be at the interface between the ligand-bound heads of extracellular dimers. This results in a reduction in multimerization (from ~46% in wild type to ~26% in the mutant; see Figure below). We also tested a mutation at the C-terminal tip of Domain IV, in a region close to where the dimerization arm is docked in the autoinhibited conformation of the ligand-free extracellular domain. This mutation (Leu 595 to Arg) also results in a reduction in multimerization (to ~16%). This reduction cannot be accounted for by the dimer-dimer interfaces in our model.

When we made additional mutations at the asymmetric kinase dimer interface in this dimerization arm deletion construct, we observed a reduction of the two-step bleaching events. This suggests that these two-step bleaching events are unlikely to result from non-specific protein aggregation. We reasoned that the increased two-step bleaching events we observed for the dimerization arm deletion construct (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and the other domain IV tether deletion construct (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) are a consequence of released autoinhibition, which converts the extracellular domain to a more extended conformation that does not impede dimerization.
