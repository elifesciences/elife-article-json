The same is true for real clownfish, and this is just one of many examples of cooperation between species. There are even more intimate associations, such as those found when microbes colonize a larger host organism. For example, some species of bacteria can colonize plants of the legume family (which includes peas and beans) and provide them with nitrogen, which is an important plant nutrient. These bacteria, which are called rhizobia, invade plant roots and reprogram them to produce a special organ called a nodule, in which they live (<a href=\"#bib7\">Oldroyd, 2013</a>)."

In both rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbioses, the plant rewards its microbe partners with a supply of carbon and energy."

When the fungus, called <i>Rhizopus microsporus,</i> infects rice plants it produces a toxin that can prevent the rice cells from dividing. Almost 10 years ago it was discovered that the production of this toxin depends on the presence of the bacterium <i>Burkholderia rhizoxinica</i> within the cells of the fungus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Partida-Martinez and Hertweck, 2005</a>). It was later discovered that the reproduction of the fungus also depends on the presence of the bacteria (<a href=\"#bib9\">Partida-Martinez et al., 2007</a>)."

Moebius et al. started by hypothesizing that a bacterial type II secretion system\u2014which allows protein secretion across bacterial cell membranes, and is involved in the infection of other organisms by bacteria\u2014could also be important for the symbiosis between the bacteria and fungus. Previously they had shown that a type III secretion system is important for the interaction (<a href=\"#bib4\">Lackner et al., 2011</a>). Now they confirm that a type II secretion system is also involved by showing that mutagenesis of the type II secretion system in B. rhizoxinica reduced the ability of the fungus to infect rice."

This does not appear to be the case when <i>B. rhizoxinica</i> enters <i>R. microsporus</i>.
