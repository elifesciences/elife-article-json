While transcriptional regulation of injury-induced gene expression is widely studied, less is known about the roles of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in post-transcriptional regulation during axon regeneration. In <i>C. elegans</i> the CELF (CUGBP and Etr-3 Like Factor) family RBP UNC-75 is required for axon regeneration. Using crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (CLIP-seq) we identify a set of genes involved in synaptic transmission as mRNA targets of UNC-75. In particular, we show that UNC-75 regulates alternative splicing of two mRNA isoforms of the SNARE Syntaxin/<i>unc-64</i>. In <i>C. elegans</i> mutants lacking <i>unc-75</i> or its targets, regenerating axons form growth cones, yet are deficient in extension. Extending these findings to mammalian axon regeneration, we show that mouse <i>Celf2</i> expression is upregulated after peripheral nerve injury and that <i>Celf2</i> mutant mice are defective in axon regeneration. Further, mRNAs for several Syntaxins show CELF2 dependent regulation. Our data delineate a post-transcriptional regulatory pathway with a conserved role in regenerative axon extension."

While transcriptional regulation of injury-induced gene expression is widely studied, less is known about the roles of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in post-transcriptional regulation during axon regeneration. In <i>C. elegans</i> the CELF (CUGBP and Etr-3 Like Factor) family RBP UNC-75 is required for axon regeneration. Using crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (CLIP-seq) we identify a set of genes involved in synaptic transmission as mRNA targets of UNC-75. In particular, we show that UNC-75 regulates alternative splicing of two mRNA isoforms of the SNARE Syntaxin/<i>unc-64</i>. In <i>C. elegans</i> mutants lacking <i>unc-75</i> or its targets, regenerating axons form growth cones, yet are deficient in extension. Extending these findings to mammalian axon regeneration, we show that mouse <i>Celf2</i> expression is upregulated after peripheral nerve injury and that <i>Celf2</i> mutant mice are defective in axon regeneration. Further, mRNAs for several Syntaxins show CELF2 dependent regulation. Our data delineate a post-transcriptional regulatory pathway with a conserved role in regenerative axon extension."

While much work has focused on injury-regulated gene transcription, increasing evidence points to roles for post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs by RNA binding proteins (RBPs). In rodents, the Zipcode Binding Protein ZBP1 can bind axonal mRNAs and affect peripheral nerve regeneration via mRNA transport and decay (<a href=\"#bib16\">Donnelly et al., 2011</a>). In Xenopus, hnRNP K binds mRNAs of growth-associated proteins such as GAP43 and NF-M and promotes protein synthesis in optic nerve regeneration (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Recently, the conserved RNA 3\u2019-terminal phosphate cyclase has been identified as an inhibitor of axon regeneration in <i>C. elegans,</i> Drosophila and mouse, acting through RNA repair and splicing (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kosmaczewski et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Song et al., 2015</a>).

To identify direct targets of UNC-75 in <i>C. elegans</i> neurons we performed neuronal CLIP-seq to locate UNC-75 binding sites. Many UNC-75 target sites are in genes involved in synaptic transmission. We show that UNC-75 binding to an intronic site of UNC-64/Syntaxin promotes expression of neuronal UNC-64/Syntaxin isoforms. Loss of UNC-75 or of UNC-64 causes distinctive phenotypes in which regenerative growth cones are formed but are unable to extend. Overexpression of UNC-64 in <i>unc-75</i> null mutants can rescue axon regeneration defects, indicating that UNC-64 is a major target of UNC-75 in regenerating neurons. Extending these findings to mammals, we find that mouse <i>Celf2</i> expression is induced by axon injury and that CELF2 is required for effective peripheral axon regeneration. Furthermore, we identify multiple <i>Syntaxin</i> genes as CELF2 targets. Together, our data reveal a conserved pro-regeneration pathway operating at the level of alternative splicing."

We further tested whether <i>unc-75</i> affected regeneration of GABAergic motor neurons. In wild type, around 35% of DD2 commissures and 50% of VD4 commissures regrow to the dorsal cord by 24\u2009hr after axotomy, whereas in <i>unc-75</i> mutants fewer than 10% of commissures regrew to the dorsal cord (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

Moreover, expression of UNC-75 using a touch neuron specific promoter (<i>Pmec-4</i>) fully rescued PLM regrowth, indicating that UNC-75 acts cell-autonomously (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Expression of UNC-75 in wild type animals did not enhance regrowth, indicating that UNC-75 is necessary but not sufficient to promote axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). A mutant <i>unc-75</i> cDNA lacking the NLS, expressed under its own promoter, failed to rescue behavioral defects of <i>unc-75</i> mutant (<a href=\"#bib18\">Loria et al., 2003</a>) and did not significantly rescue the regeneration defects (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), supporting its function in the nucleus. In <i>unc-75</i> mutant neurons the rate of axon extension was reduced at multiple time points after injury (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), despite the presence of growth cones at the tip of the regrowing axons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Using time-lapse imaging we found that wild-type PLM regenerative growth cones tended to be small and transient, and converted rapidly to elongating axons. In contrast, <i>unc-75</i> mutants frequently displayed regenerative growth cones with dynamic filopodial protrusions, but these did not drive long-range axon extension (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>,<a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). Indeed, we observed growth cones more frequently in non-regenerating PLM axons in <i>unc-75</i> mutants than in the wild type (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), consistent with previous observations that presence of a growth cone does not correlate highly with axon extension (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Edwards and Hammarlund, 2014</a>). Injured motor axons in <i>unc-75</i> mutants also formed regenerative growth cones that failed to extend (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Thus UNC-75 is required for regenerative axon extension but is either dispensable or a negative regulator of regenerative growth cone formation."

We used two methods to map the unique reads onto <i>C. elegans</i> genome (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and also manually inspected the genomic loci containing UNC-75 CLIP peak positions. We identified 533 functionally annotated protein-coding genes as UNC-75 targets (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). 79% of the peaks in protein-coding genes were in intronic regions, and 21% in exons or UTRs, consistent with previous results implicating UNC-75 in alternative splicing (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kuroyanagi et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Norris et al., 2014</a>). We determined overrepresented motifs for UNC-75 binding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

In <i>unc-75</i> mutants expression of an UNC-64A::GFP reporter was strongly reduced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), whereas an UNC-64B::GFP reporter was ectopically expressed in the nervous system (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). To define the roles of UNC-75 binding sites in this differential regulation, we then generated a neuronal splicing reporter for UNC-64A and UNC-64B, using <i>unc-64</i> genomic DNA from exon 7 to exon 8b, with RFP inserted 3\u2019 to exon 8a and GFP inserted 3\u2019 to exon 8b (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In a\u00a0wild type background, these transgenic animals expressed RFP strongly in the nervous system (UNC-64A-like expression), whereas GFP (reflecting the UNC-64B isoform) was undetectable. In <i>unc-75</i> mutants, neuronal RFP expression was greatly reduced and GFP expression was increased in neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Furthermore, deletion of the UNC-75 CLIP site in intron 7 of the splicing reporter increased UNC-64B::GFP expression in neurons and in non-neuronal tissues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In addition, by RNA-seq, we detected significantly more reads mapping to intron 7a of <i>unc-64</i> in <i>unc-75</i> mutants, and fewer reads mapping to intron 7b compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These analyses suggest UNC-75 binding in intron 7 promotes alternative splicing of exon 8a and represses inclusion of exon 8b through intron retention, resulting in neuronal expression of UNC-64A and repression of UNC-64B."

A premature stop codon mutation (<i>js116)</i> in the UNC-64A transmembrane domain causes complete loss of function, indicating the importance of this domain (<a href=\"#bib59\">Saifee et al., 1998</a>). Consistent with this, expression of UNC-64 lacking a transmembrane domain (UNC-64\u0394TM) was unable to rescue the movement defect of <i>unc-64(md130)</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), a partial loss of function (<i>plf)</i> allele affecting both isoforms (<a href=\"#bib41\">van Swinderen et al., 1999</a>). We further expressed specific isoforms using cDNAs, and found that pan-neuronal expression of UNC-64A, but not of UNC-64B, was able to rescue the locomotion defects of <i>unc-64(plf)</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

As <i>unc-64(js115)</i> null mutants arrest in the first larval stage (<a href=\"#bib59\">Saifee et al., 1998</a>), we used two approaches to examine the null phenotype of <i>unc-64</i> in regeneration. We first tested <i>unc-64(js115)</i> null mutants in which lethality, but not movement, was rescued by expression of UNC-64 under the combined control of <i>acr-2, unc-17</i>, and <i>glr-1</i> promoters (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>). In such animals PLM developed normally and axon regeneration was inhibited to a similar extent as in <i>unc-64(plf)</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To address caveats due to possible misexpression of this transgene in touch neurons, we also generated a single-copy transgene containing LoxP-flanked <i>unc-64A(cDNA)</i> driven by the pan-neural <i>rgef-1</i> promoter, which fully rescued <i>unc-64(0)</i> lethality and locomotor defects (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). We then excised the floxed copy of <i>unc-64A(+)</i> in touch neurons using P<i>mec-7</i>-nCre (<a href=\"#bib22\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). The <i>unc-64(0)</i> PLM axons developed normally (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and displayed reduced regrowth after axotomy, comparable to <i>unc-64(plf)</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We conclude that UNC-64 is specifically required for axon regeneration but not development, and that the null phenotype of <i>unc-64</i> is a partial block in regeneration. Regenerative growth cones in <i>unc-64(md130)</i> mutants had dynamic filopodia but did not effectively elongate, resembling those of <i>unc-75(0)</i> (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Moreover, regrowth defects in <i>unc-64(md130)</i> were rescued by pan-neuronal expression of either UNC-64A or UNC-64B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting either isoform is sufficient for function in regeneration when overexpressed."

By sequence comparison, UNC-75 is more closely related to the CELF3/4/5/6 subfamily (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and a previous study showed that expression of human CELF4 partly rescues the locomotion defects of <i>unc-75</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib18\">Loria et al., 2003</a>).

Our findings, together with previous RNA-seq analyses, identify contexts in which UNC-75/CELF regulates alternative splicing for inclusion of neuron-specific exons in <i>C. elegans</i>. The production of neuronal mRNA encoding <i>unc-32</i>/ATPase depends on alternative splicing of two sets of mutually exclusive exons, which involves UNC-75 binding to their flanking introns, partly in collaboration with the RBPs ASD-1 and FOX-1 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kuroyanagi et al., 2013a</a>). Motor neuron subtype alternative splicing of <i>unc-16</i>/JIP3 mRNA also involves UNC-75 binding to intron sequences, and the outcome of exon inclusion or exclusion partly depends on the Elav-like RBP EXC-7 in cholinergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib53\">Norris et al., 2014</a>). These previous studies were based on comparisons of whole-organism RNA levels, which reflect both direct and indirect regulation by UNC-75. As neurons contribute a small fraction of the overall <i>C. elegans</i> transcriptome, many neuronal targets of UNC-75 may have been overlooked in such studies. Our use of neuronal CLIP-seq validates some previous targets as direct interactors of UNC-75 and has expanded the number of candidate targets by an order of magnitude."

The close similarity between <i>unc-75</i> and <i>unc-64</i> regeneration phenotypes, and the ability of UNC-64 overexpression to rescue <i>unc-75</i> defects suggest that they act in a common pathway for regenerative axon extension. We therefore focused on how UNC-75 mechanistically promotes UNC-64 expression. Our analysis shows that UNC-75 binding to intron 7b promotes inclusion of the upstream exon 8a, leading to production of UNC-64A at the expense of UNC-64B. These results support the general model that UNC-75 tends to promote inclusion of upstream exons by binding downstream intronic sites (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kuroyanagi et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Norris et al., 2014</a>). Loss of UNC-75 caused increased pre-mRNA containing <i>unc-64</i> intron 7a and decreased pre-mRNA containing intron 7b, suggesting that alternative splicing of <i>unc-64</i> is regulated via selective intron retention. In <i>unc-75</i> mutants, we detected reduced UNC-64A::GFP expression from our reporter line (P<i>unc-64-unc-64A</i>::gfp), although the reporter lacked intron 7b (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The reduction of UNC-64A expression from this reporter was not as dramatic as that from the dual reporter containing intron 7b (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). We speculate that if the primary binding site is not available (i.e. intron 7b), UNC-75 can bind to secondary sites (e.g. intron 7a) to regulate UNC-64A expression. Consistent with this idea, we detected UNC-75 binding tags from our CLIP-seq in intron 7a (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

However until now, in vivo functions of CELF2 have not been explored using genetics. We find that CELF2 is essential for viability.

The function of CELF family members in AS was first explored in non-neuronal cells (e.g. cardiomyocytes), but given their widespread expression in the brain increasing attention has been given to the neuronal roles of CELF proteins (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ladd, 2013</a>). CELF4 appears to be predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of neurons and is implicated in neuronal excitability (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wagnon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Yang et al., 2007</a>). A CELF4 CLIP-seq analysis in mouse brain identified numerous targets, including many genes implicated in synaptic transmission, although CELF4 is thought to primarily regulate mRNA translation (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wagnon et al., 2012</a>). CELF2 is known to regulate the AS of specific neuronal genes, including NMDAR1, MAPT/tau, and NF1 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barron et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Han and Cooper, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Leroy et al., 2006</a>).

Here we report a genome-wide CLIP-seq approach to find CELF2 targets in neuronal cells. Consistent with our analysis of UNC-75 neuronal targets, in neuroblastoma cells, CELF2 binding sites were found in several Syntaxin genes. Like UNC-64, several mammalian Syntaxins are known to undergo alternative splicing, and we find that expression of two Syntaxin isoforms (stx2-002 and stx16-001) is significantly reduced in <i>Celf2</i> mutant brains."

Expression of CELF2 or other CELF genes is altered by cellular stress or damage in several contexts, although the mechanisms of induction remain poorly understood. In epithelial cells CELF2 expression is induced by UV or gamma irradiation injury (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2003</a>). In the nervous system CELF1 has been reported to be upregulated after spinal cord injury (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). CELF2 expression is also downregulated in some models of ischemic brain injury and fetal alcohol syndrome, although it is unclear whether this is cause or consequence (<a href=\"#bib55\">Otsuka et al., 2009</a>). Acute induction of CELF2 expression has been most extensively studied during T cell activation, and occurs partly at the level of transcription and partly by stabilization of <i>Celf2</i> transcripts (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mallory et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">2015</a>). Recently CELF2 has been found to regulate alternative splicing of the MAPKK MKK7, facilitating a JNK-dependent positive feedback loop during T cell activation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Martinez et al., 2015</a>). JNK is required for the increased stability of CELF2 messages after T cell activation, by as-yet unknown mechanisms. Many targets of JNK-regulated AS are also dependent on CELF2 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Martinez et al., 2015</a>), suggesting the CELF2/JNK positive feedback loop might function widely to regulate inducible alternative splicing."

The roles of the two UNC-64 isoforms and the mechanistic basis for their functional difference have remained a topic of debate. As truncation of UNC-64A causes apparent complete loss of function (<a href=\"#bib59\">Saifee et al., 1998</a>), UNC-64A appears to be the predominant functional isoform in neurons. Overexpression of either A or B isoform rescued the axon regrowth defect of <i>unc-64</i> hypomorphs, but only the A isoform was sufficient to rescue <i>unc-64</i> locomotor defects when overexpressed. The level of UNC-64 function required in regeneration may be lower than in behavior. A recent study also reported <i>unc-64</i> splicing is regulated by <i>unc-75</i> (<a href=\"#bib53\">Norris et al., 2014</a>). However, using fosmid transgenes, this study found that while either A or B isoform could rescue <i>unc-64</i> Ric phenotypes, only UNC-64B could rescue <i>unc-64</i> locomotor phenotypes. The basis for this discrepancy might reflect differences in the promoters and nature of expression (pan-neural and cDNA in our study, endogenous regulatory sequences including splicing of 5\u2019 exons in Norris et al.). We find that transgenic expression of UNC-64A (cDNA bypassing splicing) also significantly suppressed <i>unc-75</i> locomotor and regeneration phenotypes whereas overexpression of UNC-64B was unable to rescue. The simplest interpretation of these data is that UNC-64B is unable to fully substitute for reduced levels of UNC-64A. Possibly, UNC-64B but not UNC-64A requires some additional cofactor lacking in <i>unc-75</i>."

In mammalian neurons Syntaxin-3 has been implicated in fatty acid stimulated axon plasma membrane expansion resulting from fusion of transport organelles (<a href=\"#bib13\">Darios and Davletov, 2006</a>). Such organelles might be related to the Syntaxin-containing transport packets involved in presynaptic assembly (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmari et al., 2000</a>). The recycling endosome component Syntaxin13 is upregulated by injury and is thought to promote membrane recycling required for regrowth (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cho et al., 2014</a>).

Crosslinking induced mutation sites (CIMS) introduced by reverse transcriptase when bypassing the crosslink sites have been frequently detected in CLIP-seq data (<a href=\"#bib67\">Ule et al., 2005</a>). Therefore we also used CIMS analysis method (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zhang and Darnell, 2011</a>) when defining the peaks. We identified 1060 peaks located on 885 protein-coding genes (513 of which are functionally annotated) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). As expected, the two different peak calling methods (with or without CIMS) showed partial overlap, with 212 genes in common.

To generate an inducible Neuro2A stable cell line expressing biotin-tagged Celf2 (cDNA) that can be controlled to express at endogenous levels, we modified the original in vivo biotin-tagging system using a Tet-On retroviral inducible system from Clontech. Briefly, Celf2 was fused in-frame to the C terminus of the peptide MAGGLNDIFEAQKIEWHEDTGGGGSGGGGSGENLYFQSDYKDDDDK in the BLRP expression construct. Amino acids 1\u201320 represent a biotin ligase recognition peptide (BLRP), in which the lysine residue at position 13 is a substrate for the bacterial biotin ligase (BirA) upon co-expression in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). The glycine-rich stretch following the BLRP sequence provides a spacer region, and the ENLYFQS sequence (in bold and underlined) provides a specific cleavage site for TEV protease (Life Technologies,\u00a0Carlsbad, CA). Following the TEV site, there is a FLAG tag. The BLRP-Celf2 cassette was ligated into a retrovirus-based Tet-On vector then co-transfected with pCL-Ampho packaging plasmid into 293T cell line to prepare retrovirus. Retrovirus was then transduced into a parental Neuro2A stable line that was engineered to stably express BirA and a Tet Repressor using a retroviral vector. G418 (150\u2009\u03bcg/ml), hygromycin (200\u2009\u03bcg/ml), and puromycin (0.7\u2009\u03bcg/ml) were used for stable selection.

The homogenate ws centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000\u2009rpm at 4\u00b0C to get the nuclear fraction in the pellet. The pellet was then washed twice in 1x Hypotonic Buffer and resuspended in 1\u2009ml CLIP lysis buffer (50\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4; 100\u2009mM NaCl; 1\u2009mM MgCl2; 0.1\u2009mM CaCl2; 1% NP-40; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS; Protease inhibitor and anti-RNase) per 100\u2009\u03bcl pellet followed by sonication on ice. 5 ul Turbo DNase was added per 1\u2009ml of lysates followed by incubation at 37\u00b0Cfor 3\u20135\u2009min.

The nerve was crushed with a pair of fine (#55) forceps for 20 s and the crush site marked using activated carbon powder (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bauder and Ferguson, 2012</a>). 3 days later the mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> and sciatic nerves obtained for analysis. Sciatic nerves were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3\u2009hr, then washed with PBS, immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS, cryopreserved in OCT compound (TissueTek) and cryosectioned at 10\u2009\u03bcm thickness. Samples were immunostained with anti-SCG10 (1:3000) (Novus Biologicals STMN2 NBP1-49461). After staining, multiple images along the nerve were taken using a 10X objective (Zeiss LSM710) and montaged using Photoshop (Adobe). Representative images are shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>. We used Metamorph software to measure SCG10 staining fluorescence intensity in tdTomato positive axons (Cre-expressing neurons). At each distance point, at least 10\u201320 regions with tdTomato signal were randomly selected in the red channel and regions of interest (ROI) defined. These regions were then transferred to the green channel and the average intensity of green fluorescence measured. Average intensity from all the regions at each distance point was then normalized to the average intensity immediately proximal to the crush site."

In each instance, the effects being observed are large and convincing. The genetic analyses are thorough, including the generation of splicing reporters that are convincing and show large effect. The genetic data are appropriately interpreted. At the end of this manuscript, we are left with the finding that alternative syntaxin splicing is involved in the regenerative response, but there is no indication how syntaxin might participate. However, the paper, as written, is strong and the authors should not be required to make that next mechanistic leap in this paper. The story is solid and already makes the leap from work to mammalian systems, providing evidence of conserved signaling across distant species. I have only minor concerns."
