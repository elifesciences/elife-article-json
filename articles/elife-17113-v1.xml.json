How the initial contractions are established and the downstream consequences of the earliest contractile function on cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis have not been described. Using high-resolution live imaging of mouse embryos, we observed randomly distributed spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillations (SACOs) in the forming cardiac crescent (stage E7.75) prior to overt beating. Nascent contraction initiated at around E8.0 and was associated with sarcomeric assembly and rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, underpinned by sequential expression of the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX1) and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (LTCC). Pharmacological inhibition of NCX1 and LTCC revealed rapid development of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in the early heart and an essential early role for NCX1 in establishing SACOs through to the initiation of beating. NCX1 blockade impacted on CaMKII signalling to down-regulate cardiac gene expression, leading to impaired differentiation and failed crescent maturation."

How the initial contractions are established and the downstream consequences of the earliest contractile function on cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis have not been described. Using high-resolution live imaging of mouse embryos, we observed randomly distributed spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillations (SACOs) in the forming cardiac crescent (stage E7.75) prior to overt beating. Nascent contraction initiated at around E8.0 and was associated with sarcomeric assembly and rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, underpinned by sequential expression of the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX1) and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (LTCC). Pharmacological inhibition of NCX1 and LTCC revealed rapid development of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in the early heart and an essential early role for NCX1 in establishing SACOs through to the initiation of beating. NCX1 blockade impacted on CaMKII signalling to down-regulate cardiac gene expression, leading to impaired differentiation and failed crescent maturation."

The flow of calcium ions into and out of the cardiomyocytes triggers these heartbeats. In addition to triggering heart contractions, calcium ions also act as a messenger that drives changes in which genes are active in the cardiomyocytes and how these cells behave."

Using drugs to block the movement of calcium ions, Tyser, Miranda et al. also show that a protein called NCX1 is required to trigger the calcium flows prior to the first heartbeat. Moreover, the experiments revealed that these early heartbeats help drive the growth of cardiomyocytes and shape the developing heart."

In the mouse, mesoderm originating from the primitive streak forms a bilateral pool of progenitor cells that at E7.5 give rise to the cardiac crescent (CC). The CC subsequently expands and migrates to the midline whereupon, between E8.25 and E8.5, the two sides of the CC fuse and form the linear heart tube (LHT) (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib9\">Buckingham et al., 2005</a>). The first cardiac contractions have been described during the transition from CC to LHT. Studies of heart development in model organisms have historically focused on the origin and spatial-temporal allocation of cardiac progenitors and cardiovascular lineage determination (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buckingham et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Saga et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cai et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Meilhac et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Wu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Moretti et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Evans et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Devine et al., 2014</a>). Whilst insight into the identification and regulation of cardiac cell types is important for improved understanding of congenital heart disease (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bruneau, 2008</a>), an anatomical and cellular bias has overlooked a role for the onset of cardiac function. Early descriptions of initial cardiac contractions (<a href=\"#bib49\">Navaratnam et al., 1986</a>), including suggested pacemaker activity on either side of the embryonic midline (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goss, 1952</a>), as well as optical mapping of spontaneous action potentials performed in both chicken (7 somite stage) and rat (3-somite stage) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fujii et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hirota et al., 1985</a>), have been informative, but lack resolution. Subsequent studies in mouse (3-somite stage) could only infer early electrical activity based on irregular fluctuations in basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nishii and Shibata, 2006</a>). Given the forming heart contracts from an early stage, this raises the important question of when and how contractile activity of cardiomyocytes is first initiated during development and to what extent this influences the progression of differentiation and subsequent cardiac morphogenesis. This is especially important as the forces exerted by cardiac contractions have been shown in several models to be required for proper heart development (<a href=\"#bib22\">Granados-Riveron and Brook, 2012</a>), and to modulate gene expression (<a href=\"#bib43\">Miyasaka et al., 2011</a>) at later developmental stages."

                        "text": "In mature cardiomyocytes, coordinated electrical excitation is coupled to physical contraction in a process termed excitation contraction coupling (ECC) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bers, 2002</a>). ECC relies on changes in the intracellular concentration of the second messenger Ca<sup>2+</sup> via release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in a process termed Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fabiato and Fabiato, 1979</a>). Increases in the concentration of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> result in cardiomyocyte contraction due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to troponin and myofilament activation. ECC involves a number of specific proteins including L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LTCC, sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx), ryanodine receptors (RyR2, SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release), the sarco\u00a0(endo)\u00a0plasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA, SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake) and the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX, Sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux). Targeted disruption of genes encoding ECC proteins in mice has shown that contractile activity of immature cardiomyocytes does not require ECC. Embryonic cardiomyocytes have a less developed SR and T-tubule system as well as an increased requirement for sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (<a href=\"#bib14\">Conway et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Seki et al., 2003</a>) and whilst they express a variety of ion channels and exchangers present in the adult heart (<a href=\"#bib63\">Seisenberger et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cribbs et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Linask et al., 2001</a>), the expression and activity of these proteins is distinct from that in mature cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Liang et al., 2010</a>). Using isolated cells as well as genetically manipulated animals, two contrasting mechanisms have been proposed for how Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are generated in the developing heart from approximately E8.5 onwards. Early studies suggested that myocyte contraction is triggered by sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with little or no contribution from the SR (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nakanishi et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Takeshima et al., 1998</a>). In contrast, more recently it has been shown that at ~E8.5\u20139, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients originate from the SR, via RyR together with InsP<sub>3</sub> channels, to trigger electrical activity as well as contraction (<a href=\"#bib70\">Viatchenko-Karpinski et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">M\u00e9ry et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sasse\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rapila et al., 2008</a>). Whilst these studies characterised SR function at ~E8.5\u20139, they did not investigate how Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are regulated at the earliest stages of cardiac crescent development when contraction is initiated, and relied on experiments performed using isolated cells cultured for between 12 to 70\u2009hr (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sasse\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rapila et al., 2008</a>). Thus there is a lack of cellular resolution <i>in vivo</i> and no current mechanistic insight into the onset of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and its impact on differentiation and cardiogenesis."

A difficulty with these reports is the use of \u2018embryonic day\u2019 or \u2018somite number\u2019 to stage the developing heart. Somite number is variable in its correlation to the overall embryonic stage (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kaufman and Navaratnam, 1981</a>), can depend on genetic background (<a href=\"#bib47\">M\u00e9ry et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Porter and Rivkees, 2001</a>) and importantly, is not a sufficiently fine-grained proxy for the developmental stages of the heart. This can lead to ambiguities, as a \u20183-somite\u2019 embryo may range from the cardiac crescent to early LHT stages. We, therefore, created a staging system specific to the early heart, from early crescent to LHT (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1a</a>), similar to studies at later stages when a more precise morphological characterization is necessary (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biben and Harvey, 1997</a>). On this basis, we defined four stages (0, 1, 2 and 3) of cardiac crescent development prior to the LHT stage, based on clear morphological differences. Stage 0 hearts represented the first discernible crescent structure situated beneath the developing head folds, being the widest (360\u2013390 \u00b5m along the medio-lateral axis) and thinnest (70\u201380 \u00b5m along the rostro-caudal axis) of the crescent stages (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1a</a>). Whilst stage 1 was morphologically similar to stage 0, the cardiac crescent had become narrower (300\u2013370 \u00b5m) and thicker (75\u201395 \u00b5m). By stage 2, folding of the cardiac crescent is evident based on the formation of a trough at the embryonic midline and two lobes on either side. As the embryo transitions to stage 3 this trough becomes less obvious with a rostral-caudal elongation of the heart as the LHT begins to form. Transition from stage 3 to the LHT was defined by the complete fusion of the two lobes and loss of the central trough (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1a</a>)."

At stage 0, cTnT was the most evident contractile protein within the early cardiac crescent, albeit without sarcomeric banding (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Both \u03b1-Actinin and Myomesin appeared in small clusters of cells at stage 0 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Sarcomeric banding of these proteins, indicative of contractile capability, only manifested later in discrete regions within stage 1 and 2 crescents (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). This was surprising given that the crescent stages of early heart development are thought to correspond to non-differentiated cardiac mesoderm (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib24\">Harvey, 2002</a>), without prior reports of contractile machinery or functionality. By stage 3, sarcomere assembly and myofibrilar banding became more uniform, coincident with coalescence of the paired crescent primordia to the embryonic midline. This increased through to the linear heat tube stage, consistent with progressive cardiomyocyte maturation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). To further characterize stage development in relation to sarcomere assembly, qRT-PCR was performed on isolated cardiac crescents, to assess the corresponding gene expression of <i>Myom1</i> (encoding Myom), <i>Actn2</i> (encoding \u03b1-actinin) and <i>Tnnt2</i> (encoding cTnT) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). <i>Myom1, Actn2</i> and <i>Tnnt2</i> expression significantly increased between stages 0 and 1 and continued to increase until formation of the LHT (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1b</a>)."

These foci generally contracted at the same rate, indicative of either synchronization or a shared intrinsic beat rate for nascent cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The earliest cardiac contractions had a frequency of approximately 30 beats per minute (BPM), which increased significantly by stage 3 (after approximately 5\u2009hr) to around 60 BPM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Contractile activity requires cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux, therefore, to investigate the earliest manifestations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling within the cardiac crescent, we loaded embryos with the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Cal-520 followed by live imaging using confocal microscopy. From stage 1 crescents until late stage 3, lateral propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was observed across the embryonic midline (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), even through regions of non-contractile tissue (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). As the cardiac crescent starts to fuse to form the LHT, the transients switch from a lateral to a more caudal-rostral propagation (data not shown). At stage 0 spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (SACOs) were observed within the forming crescent, in the absence of contractile activity and sarcomeric banding of cTnT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). SACOs were observed in all stage 0 cardiac crescents imaged (n\u00a0=\u00a035), propagated within individual cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2019\u2019</a>) and displayed a range of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics with variable frequencies and durations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2019</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Compared to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at later stages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) SACOs were significantly slower, with fluorescence reaching peak intensity between 0.79 and 11.9\u2009s and decreasing with a similar slow rate of efflux (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). During a ~20\u2009s recording period we observed only 10.3 \u00b1 0.7 individual SACOs per embryo (n\u00a0=\u00a035) occurring in different sites. Consecutive SACOs in the same site were rarely observed within the 20 s imaging window and, therefore, we conclude that SACOs in individual cells occur at a frequency &lt; 3 bpm. The appearance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the embryonic heart prior to beating (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>) is consistent with the idea that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling within early cardiac progenitors may be important to promote sufficient differentiation for subsequent contractile function (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mesaeli et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Li\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2002</a>)."

We, therefore, assessed ECC gene expression on embryonic hearts at the different stages defined herein; focusing specifically on <i>Slc8a1</i> (encoding NCX1), <i>Cacna1c</i> and <i>Cacna1d</i> (encoding the LTCC subunits, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 respectively; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), <i>Atp2a2</i> (encoding SERCA2), <i>Iptr2</i> (encoding InsP<sub>3</sub> type 2 channels) and <i>Ryr2 (</i>encoding RyR2) that collectively are key components of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1b</a>). Between E7.75 (as defined by the presence of clear head-folds but not a cardiac crescent) and stage 0, <i>Slc8a1</i> significantly increased 21 fold (p-value&lt;0.001), whilst <i>Cacna1c</i> revealed a modest but non-significant increase of 2.5 fold (p-value&gt;0.05) and <i>Cacna1d</i> a significant 4-fold increase (p-value &lt;0.01). From stage 1 onwards <i>Slc8a1, Cacna1c</i> and <i>Cacna1d</i> expression continued to significantly increase until stage 3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <i>Slc8a1</i>, 234-fold; <i>Cacna1c,</i> 38-fold; <i>Cacna1d,</i> 41-fold).

Whilst NCX1 was clearly detectable within the cardiac crescent at stage 0 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 was absent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Differences in the expression of NCX1 and LTCC prior to beating were not maintained at later stages, after established contraction (stage 2 onwards), when both channels were expressed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,I</a>). In EBs at day 7 of culture, both NCX1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 were expressed, but whilst NCX1 was consistently co-expressed with cTnT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), there were cTnT+ foci that were negative for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Collectively, this expression data suggests that NCX1 precedes Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 within the developing cardiac crescent at stage 0, being present prior to and at the onset of both SACOs and beating, whereas Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 became upregulated later from stage 1 onwards. Of note, while NCX1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 signal was detected in other regions of the embryo, notably in the head folds, in contrast to the heart it was not membrane localised in these regions, indicative of non-functional protein.

We inhibited NCX1 using the specific inhibitors CB-DMB (<a href=\"#bib62\">Secondo et al., 2009</a>) or KB-R7943 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kimura et al., 1999</a>), the LTCC using nifedipine (<a href=\"#bib40\">McDonald et al., 1994</a>) and Ryanodine together with 2-APB to simultaneously block RyR and InsP<sub>3</sub>, similar to that described previously (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sasse\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rapila et al., 2008</a>). Treated embryos were imaged for contractile activity by DIC imaging and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were recorded in parallel with confocal fluorescence imaging of Cal-520. Acute treatment (for a maximum of 30 min) with NCX inhibitors (CB-DMB and KB-R7943) or LTCC inhibitor (Nifedipine), affected the embryos in a stage dependent-manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Both NCX1 and the LTCC were required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during stages 1 and 2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and their inhibition led to an initial confinement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients to one side of the crescent (within approximately 5 min of treatment, which persisted through to 15 min) followed shortly afterwards by complete loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). At stage 3 and later, only the LTCC was required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient generation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Whilst NCX1 can function in both forward (Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux from the cell) and reverse (Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the cell) modes, our data suggested that NCX1 in the early cardiac crescent was functioning in reverse mode, as KB-R7943, that is reported to specifically inhibit reverse mode NCX1 function (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hoyt et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Iwamoto, 2004</a>), recapitulated the results with CB-DMB and acted as a control for off-target effects of the latter. These data suggests that reverse mode NCX function may contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient generation at the earliest stages of cardiac contraction, potentially via\u00a0inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. The inhibitor experiments were repeated on day 7 and day 14 EBs. The relative effects of CB-DMB, KB-R7943 and nifedipine were consistent with those observed in stages 1 and 2 of the embryonic heart (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a>). Treatment with Ryanodine + 2-APB only affected more mature embryos that had already undergone both cardiac looping and embryonic turning (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and did not prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within cardiac crescents at stage 3 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This suggest that a functional SR is only required once cardiac looping has been fully initiated, more than 18\u2009hr later than the first observable SACOs within the cardiac crescent."

Whilst the embryos remained viable during the culture period, initiation of heart development was impaired in those treated with CB-DMB compared to DMSO controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). This was in contrast to treatment with Nifedipine alone, in which the crescent developed normally and progressed to an equivalent stage as DMSO treated embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). More specifically embryos cultured in the presence of CB-DMB had reduced expression of cTnT compared to embryos cultured in other conditions. However, most cells were still positive for Nkx2.5, suggesting delayed or impaired differentiation likely accounted for the failure of crescent formation under conditions of NCX1 blockade. The relative effects of NCX1 and LTCC inhibition on developmental progression and crescent formation were supported by corresponding gene expression data from cultured embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>). While <i>Tnnt2</i> was down-regulated in both CB-DMB and Nifedipine treated embryos, <i>Nkx2.5</i> was only down-regulated in CB-DMB treated embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>).

Using a staging method based on morphological landmarks (stages 0\u20133), we characterized in detail the in\u00a0vivo progression of physiological activity during early heart development.

We observed spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (SACOs) at stage 0 in the developing cardiac mesoderm, before any detectable cardiac contractions. These transients appeared sporadically in individual cells within the forming cardiac crescent and did not appear to be synchronized. At stage 1, periodic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients began to be propagated laterally through the cardiac crescent, and traversed the midline of the crescent where there were no visible contractions. This was a rapid and dynamic process occurring through stages 0\u20133 that involved sarcolemmal ion channel and exchanger function. NCX1 was exclusively required for SACOs at stage 0, whereas both NCX1 and LTCC appeared to play equally important roles at stage 1 and 2. NCX1 was no longer required from stage 3 onwards when the LTCC channels maintained Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. We observed no contribution of the SR in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within the cardiac crescent, as assessed by simultaneous blockade of RyR2 and InsP<sub>3.</sub> However, consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sasse\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rapila et al., 2008</a>), our data did show that the SR becomes functional at later stages during cardiac looping (~E8.5). This may represent a period in which SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> filling is required before a threshold for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the SR can occur, as has been proposed in the adult\u00a0setting (<a href=\"#bib66\">Stokke et al., 2011</a>). Overall our data reveals that during the time frame from the earliest cardiac morphogenesis (crescent maturation) to looping of the heart (approximately 18\u2009hr) there is a rapid transition in the mechanism by which the intracellular concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is elevated, based on distinct channel and exchanger function."

The specific role of SACOs is currently unknown and we hypothesise that they are required in cells that need to optimally activate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signalling (via the CAMKII pathway) in order to up-regulate genes necessary for further differentiation and morphogenesis. This would explain why SACOs are present much earlier than complete sarcomere assembly. An alternative hypothesis is that SACOs are a by-product of cells that are already committed to specific cardiac lineages and, therefore, arise with the expression of specific channels required for future function. This could explain the variation in duration and frequencies of SACOs observed within the same embryo. At this point, quite how SACOs become synchronised transients is unknown. We speculate that release of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signal from a 'pacemaker' cell may entrain neighbours to have synchronised transient periodicity. To this end we observed highly variable Ca<sup>2+</sup> periodicity but also regions containing cells of similar periodicity (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Since blockade of NCX1 prior to the formation of the cardiac crescent, and chronic treatment in ESCs, leads to impaired cardiac differentiation it is also possible that SACOs may be present in mesoderm cells earlier than reported here, which we were not able to image due to the limitations of the current experimental set-up."

                        "text": "In the embryonic heart, Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling is assigned to sequential roles for the NCX and LTCC channels, whereby NCX has been assumed to compensate, at least in part, for the rudimentary (non-functional) SR in the developing mouse heart (<a href=\"#bib14\">Conway et al., 2002</a>). In zebrafish embryos it has recently been demonstrated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and not contraction per se is essential for regulating cardiomyocyte development (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersen et al., 2015</a>). Previous studies characterised functional expression of NCX from E8.5-E9.5 (post-LHT formation) in mouse (<a href=\"#bib37\">Linask et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Reppel et al., 2007</a>) coincident with cardiac looping and significantly later than the onset of the first heat beat described herein. NCX1 knock-out mice have been generated by multiple groups, with conflicting results in regards to the phenotype, extent of mutant heart development and the stage at which embryonic lethality occurs (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wakimoto et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Koushik et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Reuter et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cho et al., 2003</a>). This suggests that loss of NCX1 may be compensated for at the level of early cardiomyocyte specification, differentiation and contraction. In mammals there are three different Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers (NCX1, NCX2 and NCX3), and it has been previously demonstrated that these three exchangers share similar physiological properties (<a href=\"#bib38\">Linck et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lytton, 2007</a>). Furthermore, NCX1 has several splicing variants with exon 1 being mutually exclusive to exon 2 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lytton, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Quednau et al., 1997</a>). It is, therefore, possible that either a different NCX or an alternative splice variant will compensate for loss of the NCX1 variant targeted in the previous studies. Indeed, in all of the previous NCX1 generic loss-of-function studies, mutant mice were created by targeting exon 2, supporting the possibility that an alternately spliced variant may be able to compensate. Furthermore, precedent for genetic ablation being compensated for over the course of development exists, whereby patterning defects were muted over time (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bloomekatz et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, our use of pharmacological channel blockers CB-DMB and KB-R7943, resulted in an acute stage-specific-loss of NCX1 function which attributed an essential role for NCX1 in generating SACOs, and potentially acting as a trigger to establish the onset of beating in the cardiac crescent and subsequent cardiomyocyte differentiation and morphogenesis. These findings are consistent with the situation in tremblor (<i>tre</i>) zebrafish which have a mutation in NCX1 leading to absence of normal calcium transients and cardiac fibrillation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Langenbacher et al., 2005</a>) as well as earlier findings in rodents demonstrating a requirement for elevated cytoplasmic calcium to drive cardiac myofibrillogenesis in developing cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib74\">Webb and Miller, 2003</a>)."

This both reinforced the relative importance of NCX1 and also provided the first indication that the exchanger may be working in reverse mode, facilitating inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> as necessary for cardiomyocyte differentiation. Furthermore, our use of the inhibitor KB-R7943, previously reported to specifically inhibit reverse mode NCX1 activity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brustovetsky et al., 2011</a>), replicated observations made with CB-DMB, such that at stage 1 and 2 both LTCC and NCX1 are required for sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Whilst inhibition of NCX1 clearly blocked SACOs in stage 0 cardiac crescents, the mechanism by which NCX1 alone could lead to periodic oscillations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is still unclear, and may require oscillations in other ions, such as Na<sup>+</sup>, and/or contribution of other sarcolemmal proteins, such as the Plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (PMCA), to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux while NCX1 is working in reverse mode. Due to the slow nature of SACOs, oscillations in energy production along with adenosine triphosphate levels could also be involved in SACO generation, especially with reduced SR function. Whilst SR inhibition did not prevent stage 3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, we have not tested the involvement of SR function at stage 0 and, therefore, cannot fully exclude that periodic Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases from the SR are involved in the generation of SACOs. The latter has been reported in cultured E8.5\u20139 embryonic cardiomyocytes as a pace making mechanism (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sasse\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rapila et al., 2008</a>) at later stages than were the focus in this study. To further understand the mechanism of NCX1 in SACO generation will require <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiological analysis to more accurately determine whether the inhibitory effect of NCX1 blockade with CB-DMB and KB-R7943 is due to effects on reverse mode NCX1 function (inhibition of translemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx) or forward mode NCX1 function (inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload), imbalance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis or off-target effects. Although the existence of the NCX1 acting in reverse mode is contentious, and the precise function of KB-R7943 is still debated in the field, it is difficult to otherwise explain how inhibition of NCX1 can block SACOs. That said, regardless of mode of action, the observation that at stage 0 SACOs were abolished with both CB-DMB and KB-R7943 treatment, but persisted when treated with nifedipine, suggests that NCX1, and not the LTCC, plays a major role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient generation within the early cardiac crescent."

NCX1 expression was further maintained at high levels during more advanced stages (stage 0-LHT), suggesting a later role in ensuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal via its forward mode of action. Of note, the early versus late roles for mammalian NCX1 and LTCC, respectively, are further supported by studies on <i>tre</i> zebrafish, whereby sarcomeric assembly defects in developing cardiomyocytes following loss of NCX1 function are not recapitulated by mutations in LTCC (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ebert et al., 2005</a>). Increased expression of NCX1 has also been linked with pathological hypertrophy and heart failure (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib65\">Sipido et al., 2002</a>), whereby elevated NCX1 is thought to compensate for defective ECC and depressed function of SERCA but also produce arrhythmogenic-delayed after-depolarisations (<a href=\"#bib23\">G\u00f3mez et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Schultz et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Venetucci et al., 2007</a>).

ESCs were exposed at a\u00a0relatively earlier stage of cardiac lineage specification and for longer periods, which was not feasible in the live embryo cultures, resulting in a stronger down-regulation of the genes investigated.

Initial characterisation of cardiac contractions was performed using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) imaging on a Spinning Disk Confocal microscope at 37\u00b0C and an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> + Air. Images were acquired at 10 frames per second (fps) for up to 20 s.

The embryos were then transferred to fresh media in a MatTek dish (MatTek Corporation, Framingham, MA) without the dye and imaged. To image Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in embryoid bodies (EBs), ESCs were cultured in hanging drops in MatTek dishes for four days under differentiation conditions. At day 7, the cells were loaded with 8\u2009\u03bcM Cal-520 for 30\u2009min in media without serum at room temperature and then transferred into media with serum and cultured in the presence of the dye for 10\u2009min at 37\u00b0C and an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> + Air. All Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was performed with a Zeiss 710 LSM fitted with an environmental chamber to maintain the embryos at 37\u00b0C at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Embryos were imaged with a 20\u00d7 air objective (0.6 NA) with a single optical section every 97 ms (~10 frames per second). Images were captured at 256 \u00d7 256 pixel dimensions, with a 2\u00d7 line step and no averaging to increase the scan speed. For acute inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in embryos (stage 1 to LHT) and EBs, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were first imaged at baseline, drug containing media was then added and imaging was performed at 5, 15 and 30 min post drug treatment. Inhibition was defined as the complete cessation as well as confinement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients to small regions of the cardiac crescent. For inhibitor experiments involving stage 0 embryos, imaging was carried out at baseline,\u00a05 and 15 min post treatment. For all the experiments involving calcium imaging of embryo the overlying yolk sac endoderm had to be dissected out in order to allow proper drug and dye penetration, as well as better visualisation of the cardiac mesoderm. For experiments involving embryos Nifedipine (Sigma-aldrich) was used at a final concentration of 10\u2009\u03bcM, CB-DMB (Sigma-aldrich) at 20\u2009\u03bcM, KB-R7943 (Sigma-aldrich) at 30\u2009\u03bcM, Ryanodine (Tocris Bioscience, England) at 100\u2009\u03bcM and 2-APB at 200\u2009\u03bcM, all diluted in DMSO (Sigma-aldrich).

For P0 and adult heart samples, RNA extraction was performed using Trizol (Invitrogen, England), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, additional DNase I (Promega, England) treatment on Trizol-extracted RNAs was carried out to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. In order to collect enough RNA for isolated cardiac crescent and head fold development, each biological replicate was composed of 10 individual cardiac crescents or head folds. For both types of extraction, RNA pellets were dissolved in RNase-free water and the RNA quality and quantity determined by Nanodrop readings at 260, 280 and 230 nm wavelengths. cDNA was generated from 1\u2009\u03bcg of RNA using random primers and SuperScript III polymerase (Invitrogen).

Primers were designed to span exon-intron boundaries, have annealing temperatures around 60\u00b0C and generate amplicons between 50\u2013200 bp. The reaction mixture and samples were loaded into either a MicroAmp Optical 96-Well Reaction Plates or MicroAmp Fast Optical 96-Well Reaction Plates and sealed with Optical Adhesive Films (Life Technologies). Quantification was performed on a ViiA 7 Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using a PCR programme of 95\u00b0C 15 min followed by 40 cycles of (95\u00b0C 15\u2009s melting phase and 60\u00b0C 1\u2009min annealing and extension). Amplification of a single amplicon was confirmed by obtaining dissociation curve (melt curve) profiles as well as using gel electrophoresis to separate the reaction product. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were generated using either Viia7 software (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression levels were obtained using the \u0394\u0394Ct method, in which expression of each gene of interest was normalised to endogenous controls (<a href=\"#bib60\">Schmittgen and Livak, 2008</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib46\">Murphy and Polak, 2002</a>), and presented as fold change over a reference sample. For time course data fold-change was calculated in relation to the earliest stages (E7.75 <i>in vivo</i>, D0 ESC models), whilst for drug treated experiments fold change was calculated relative to control (DMSO) samples. Non-template controls were performed by replacing cDNA with water, to test for non-specific amplification."

In cases where the raw data failed to map to a normal distribution with consistent variance, we applied Taylor\u2019s law to choose the best transformation for the data. All data to be analysed passed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and Bartlett test for homogeneous variances. To compare the number of affected embryos upon acute treatments, a Freeman-Halton extension of Fisher exact probability test was applied due to a smaller number of samples. To compare the effect of different treatments on the number of beating EBs, due to a large number of samples, a Chi Square test with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was performed instead. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out to directly compare temporal gene expression data from EBs with that derived from embryos; each biological replicate for embryonic stage was composed of 5\u20136 embryos and for EBs was composed of 10\u201380 EBs, depending on the day of differentiation. The data from each sample was normalized by assessing the ratio with the maximum value of all samples. A log transformation was applied to the normalized data and the principal components were calculated using R environment. The 3D representation of the PCA was constructed by plotting the 3 first components given that these explained more that 95% of the observed variance. A hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using Ward\u2019s minimum variance method as a more precise clustering algorithm to divide the samples in different groups (<a href=\"#bib73\">Ward, 1963</a>)."

Change in pixel intensity was assessed in a selected region, to reveal the contraction dynamics. Background Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was subtracted from all frames of a given time-lapse using ImageJ.

Prior studies have focused on linear heart tube looping (E8.5) stages and have relied extensively on <i>in vitro</i> analyses of isolated cells (Sasse et al. 2007; Rapila et al., 2008). In revision, we have now added additional experiments using the inhibitors Ryanodine and 2-APB to target the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) as a source of Ca<sup>2</sup> and whilst we found these inhibited cardiac function at later stages of heart development (in turned embryos at ~E8.5), there was no effect at the earliest onset of Ca<sup>2</sup> handling and contractile function. This new data suggests that mechanistically the SR is not required for the initiation of spontaneous asynchronous calcium oscillations (SACOs) or Ca<sup>2</sup> transients within the cardiac crescent. A requirement for SR function develops at later stages and further supports the role of NCX in initiating the earliest Ca<sup>2</sup> influx and the generation of SACOs."

The hearts of the various NCX1 mutants range from arresting at the linear heart tube stage to completed looping morphogenesis and there is no insight into a putative early role in establishing Ca<sup>2</sup> -handing and contraction given the varied lethality. There is also insufficient evidence in these prior studies to assess whether complete KO has occurred and/or whether compensation is occurring via NCX1 splice variants, other NCX isoforms or alternative mechanisms of Ca<sup>2</sup> influx. By using pharmacological inhibition (with two independent specific NCX-inhibitors) at defined stages of development, we are able to rule out any compensatory effects arising from germ-line genetic ablation and moreover, simultaneously target multiple isoforms to converge on a role for NCX during the onset of cardiac function."

The conditions that favour reverse mode NCX1 activity include less depolarised membrane potentials. Reversal potential, for NCX1 is around -26mV. In terms of NCX1 function this means that, if the membrane potential was lower than -26mV, \u201cforward mode\u201d activity (Ca<sup>2</sup> efflux) would occur, however at membrane potentials above -26mV \u201creverse-mode\u201d activity (Ca<sup>2</sup> influx) would predominate. Resting membrane potential of immature cardiomyocytes is known to be significantly higher than the adult (-85mV). Embryonic cardiomyocytes at around E10.5 have been shown to have a resting membrane potential of around -40mV (Sasse et al. 2007; Rapila et al. 2008), with less differentiated cardiomyocytes potentially having an even greater than -40mV membrane potential, increasing the likelihood and potential functional relevance of \u201creverse mode\u201d NCX1 activity as well as making it more susceptible to changes in the concentration of intracellular Ca<sup>2</sup> and Na. Thus NCX1 function within the stage 0 cardiac crescent could be responsible for both the Ca<sup>2</sup> influx and efflux, correlating with the slow dynamics of stage 0 Ca<sup>2</sup> transients, potentially regulating Ca<sup>2</sup> homeostasis until contraction is initiated."

The authors are correct that NCX can (under special circumstances such as elevated intracellular Na or depolarized membrane potential) lead to Ca<sup>2</sup> entry, but once this occurs, the electrogenic nature of NCX (~3 Na for 1 Ca<sup>2</sup> ) will again hyperpolarize the cell and export Na until the equilibrium potential is reached and Ca<sup>2</sup> flux ceases. Thus it is not possible that the NCX can generate periodic Ca<sup>2</sup> oscillations alone. Reverse mode only occurs if periodic action potentials are depolarizing the cell but then cells should be synchronized (no SACO). Maybe Na levels are cycling or the Na/K-ATPase is involved?
