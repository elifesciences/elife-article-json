In pancreatic \u03b2-cells, channels formed by SUR1 and Kir6.2 regulate insulin secretion and are the targets of antidiabetic sulfonylureas. Here, we used cryo-EM to elucidate structural basis of channel assembly and gating. The structure, determined in the presence of ATP and the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, at ~6 \u00c5 resolution reveals a closed Kir6.2 tetrameric core with four peripheral SUR1s each anchored to a Kir6.2 by its N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0). Intricate interactions between TMD0, the loop following TMD0, and Kir6.2 near the proposed PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site, and where ATP density is observed, suggest SUR1 may contribute to ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub> binding to enhance Kir6.2 sensitivity to both. The SUR1-ABC core is found in an unusual inward-facing conformation whereby the two nucleotide binding domains are misaligned along a two-fold symmetry axis, revealing a possible mechanism by which glibenclamide inhibits channel activity."

In pancreatic \u03b2-cells, channels formed by SUR1 and Kir6.2 regulate insulin secretion and are the targets of antidiabetic sulfonylureas. Here, we used cryo-EM to elucidate structural basis of channel assembly and gating. The structure, determined in the presence of ATP and the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, at ~6 \u00c5 resolution reveals a closed Kir6.2 tetrameric core with four peripheral SUR1s each anchored to a Kir6.2 by its N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0). Intricate interactions between TMD0, the loop following TMD0, and Kir6.2 near the proposed PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site, and where ATP density is observed, suggest SUR1 may contribute to ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub> binding to enhance Kir6.2 sensitivity to both. The SUR1-ABC core is found in an unusual inward-facing conformation whereby the two nucleotide binding domains are misaligned along a two-fold symmetry axis, revealing a possible mechanism by which glibenclamide inhibits channel activity."

The channels were purified in the presence of ATP and glibenclamide and were then rapidly frozen to preserve their structure, which allowed them to be visualized individually using electron microscopy. By analyzing the images taken from many channels, Martin et al. constructed a highly detailed, three-dimensional map of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel.

Another key player for K<sub>ATP</sub> function is membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,\u00a05-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>); as in all other Kir family members, PIP<sub>2</sub> is required for channel opening and sets the intrinsic open probability (<i>P<sub>o</sub></i>) of the channel (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hibino et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nichols, 2006</a>). Mutations disrupting channel assembly or the above-gating properties result in insulin secretion disorders, with loss- or gain-of-function mutations causing congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) or permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM), respectively (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ashcroft, 2005</a>). Importantly, K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are the targets of sulfonylureas, one of the most commonly prescribed treatments for type 2 diabetes, which stimulate insulin secretion by inhibiting channel activity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gribble and Reimann, 2003</a>). In particular, glibenclamide (GBC) binds the channel with nanomolar affinity and was instrumental for the purification and cloning of SUR1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aguilar-Bryan et al., 1995</a>)."

By comparison, SUR1, a member of the ABC transporter family, is much larger in size. In addition to a characteristic ABC core structure comprising two transmembrane domains (TMD1 and 2) and two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and 2), it has an N-terminal extension that contains a transmembrane domain (TMD0) followed by a long, cytoplasmic loop \u2018L0\u2019 which connects to the ABC core (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aguilar-Bryan et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tusn\u00e1dy et al., 2006</a>). Kir6.2 and SUR1 are uniquely dependent on each other for expression and function (<a href=\"#bib33\">Inagaki et al., 1995</a>). Interestingly, unlike most ABC transporters such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the multidrug-resistant protein P-glycoprotein, SUR1 itself has no known ion channel or transporter activity; instead, its function is to regulate Kir6.2 channels (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aguilar-Bryan et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Inagaki et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wilkens, 2015</a>).

Although Kir6.2 alone can be gated by ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub>, its sensitivities to both ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub> are increased by SUR1 by\u00a0~10-fold (<a href=\"#bib10\">Baukrowitz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Enkvetchakul et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shyng and Nichols, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tucker et al., 1997</a>). How SUR1 sensitizes Kir6.2 to ATP inhibition and PIP<sub>2</sub> stimulation remains unclear. In contrast to ATP inhibition of the channel, which does not depend on Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP hydrolysis, nucleotide stimulation of the channel is conferred by SUR1 and requires Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ashcroft and Gribble, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gribble et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nichols, 2006</a>).

Moreover, GBC has been proposed to inhibit K<sub>ATP</sub> channels by preventing Mg-nucleotide stimulation (<a href=\"#bib19\">de Wet and Proks, 2015</a>), and may do so by stabilizing the ABC core of SUR1 in an inward-facing conformation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ortiz et al., 2012</a>) but direct evidence is lacking."

Cells were transduced with recombinant adenoviruses encoding genes for a FLAG-tagged hamster SUR1 and a rat Kir6.2 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pratt et al., 2009</a>), which are 95% and 96% identical to the human sequences, respectively. These heterologously expressed channels have gating properties indistinguishable from endogenous K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pratt et al., 2009</a>). Channel integrity was found to be best preserved when membranes were solubilized in digitonin and channels purified in the presence of 1 \u00b5M glibenclamide (GBC) and 1 mM ATP (see Materials and methods) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), which was the condition used for cryo-EM structure determination."

In the map, densities corresponding to TMD0 and L0 are clearly seen, particularly TMD0, with much of this domain reaching 5 \u00c5 resolution. This is in contrast to a recent cryo-EM study of another ABC transporter containing a TMD0, TAP1/2, where TMD0 could not be resolved (<a href=\"#bib46\">Oldham et al., 2016</a>), possibly because SUR1-TMD0 in our structure is stabilized by Kir6.2. Overall, TMD0 is a five helix bundle which contains an extracellular N-terminal segment of 25 residues with a brief helical stretch, and mostly short loops connecting helices 2\u20133, 3\u20134, and 4\u20135, but a longer ICL1 of\u00a0~14 residues connecting TM1-2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The N-terminus containing the FLAG-peptide was disordered up until residue C6 of SUR1 where a highly conserved disulfide bond is formed with C26 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fukuda et al., 2011</a>) at the entrance to TM1. This region contacts the Kir6.2 turret and pore loop (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), suggesting a role in assembly and functional coupling with the pore. A number of HI-causing mutations in the N-terminal extracellular loop of TMD0 including C6G, G7R, V21D, N24K, and C26S, which disrupt channel biogenesis efficiency or gating have been reported (<a href=\"#bib41\">Martin et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yan et al., 2007</a>), further supporting the significance of this region in channel assembly and gating."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and C</a>, the hypothetically docked PIP<sub>2</sub> is surrounded by the cytoplasmic loop connecting TM3 and 4 (ICL2; E128-P133) of TMD0 and the N-terminal stretch of L0 (K192-K199) from one SUR1 subunit, and the cytoplasmic end of TM1 (K57) of TMD0 from the adjacent SUR1 subunit. Previous studies have shown that TMD0 and the N-terminal section of L0 increase the <i>P<sub>o</sub></i> of Kir6.2 to resemble intact channels (<a href=\"#bib8\">Babenko and Bryan, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chan et al., 2003</a>). As <i>P<sub>o</sub></i> is determined by PIP<sub>2</sub> interactions, our structure suggests these regions may contribute directly to PIP<sub>2</sub> binding to account for the increase in PIP<sub>2</sub> sensitivity conferred by SUR1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Enkvetchakul et al., 2000</a>). Below PIP<sub>2</sub> and near the periphery of Kir6.2 lies ATP, separated from PIP<sub>2</sub> by L0 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>) and also ICL2 of TMD0 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,E</a>). The ICL2 sits directly atop the Kir6.2 N-terminus, just before the interfacial helix (i.e. the \u2018slide helix\u2019) at Q52 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), and simultaneously contacts ICL1 of TMD0 and the most C-terminal portion of TMD0 at TM5. Mutation of E128 (E128K, a HI mutation) and F132 (F132L, a PNDM mutation) in ICL2 as well as Q52 in Kir6.2 (Q52R, a PNDM mutation) is known to disrupt channel gating by ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pratt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Proks et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Our finding that this region is close to both the ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub> sites illustrates that it is well positioned to contribute to gating regulation by both, explaining the effects of these disease mutations."

L0 has been proposed to participate in binding to the benzamido group, with mutation Y230A in L0 reducing GBC binding. We find that the amphipathic helix of L0 containing Y230 sits next to TM16 containing S1238, a residue which when mutated disrupts binding of the sulfonylurea group (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ashfield et al., 1999</a>). The two residues are separated by\u00a0~20 \u00c5 (C\u03b1 to C\u03b1), which explains how the two residues distant in the primary sequence can both contribute to binding. Although at the current resolution, we are unable to discern the density for GBC, it is likely to be bound given its high affinity.

However, in contrast to other ABC exporters of known structure whereby transporter halves are related by either a true or a pseudo two-fold symmetry axis, depending on whether the two halves are identical or not (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wilkens, 2015</a>), we find a clear rotation and a translation of TMD1-NBD1 relative to TMD2-NDB2, such that TMD1-NBD1 is\u00a0~15\u00b0 off the symmetry axis and is translated by\u00a0~10 \u00c5 horizontally (relative to the membrane) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

As discussed above, given its high-affinity GBC is likely to be bound in our structure. Thus, an interesting hypothesis is that the twisted conformation is caused by GBC binding, which would suggest that GBC prevents MgADP from stimulating the channel by causing a misalignment of the NBDs dimerization interface. Alternatively, the conformation may be unique to SUR1 and that Mg-nucleotide binding/hydrolysis is required to restore symmetry for dimerization. In this case, GBC may block stimulation by clamping down L0 and preventing it from communicating with Kir6.2. A structure in the absence of GBC will be needed to test these hypotheses."

We propose that like other ABC transporters (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wilkens, 2015</a>), the ABC core of SUR1 switches between an inward-facing and outward-facing conformations as MgATP undergoes hydrolysis or as MgADP binds at NBD2 and induces NBD dimerization. The conformational switch at the ABC core causes movement of the L0 and TMD0, which alters channel interactions with ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub> by remodeling the interface formed by the cytoplasmic domain of Kir6.2, the bottom of the Kir6.2 transmembrane helices, the intracellular loops of TMD0 and the N-terminal segment of L0. In this way, the SUR1 \u2018transport\u2019 cycle is coupled to Kir6.2 opening or closing rather than transport of substrates through SUR1 itself."

In addition to contacts made by TM1 of Kir6.2 and the first TM helix of TMD0 which are consistent with previous structure-function studies (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schwappach et al., 2000</a>), there are also new interactions revealed by the structure in the extracellular domain of TMD0 and the turret/pore loop of Kir6.2 as well as the cytoplasmic domains of TMD0 and Kir6.2. Indeed, TMD0 appears to harbor more mutations that disrupt channel biogenesis and trafficking than other regions of SUR1 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Martin et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2016</a>). It is worth noting that many mutations in TMD0 which impair channel biogenesis and trafficking can be rescued by pharmacological chaperones, specifically sulfonylureas such as GBC (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Martin et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yan et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib70\">2007</a>).

Although in our structure the Kir6.2 is bound to ATP with the pore in a closed conformation, a gating scheme whereby in the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub> remodeling of the interfaces near the ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub> sites leads to channel opening may be envisioned.

CTF was estimated from the aligned frame sums using CTFFIND4 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</a>). To reduce the possibility of bias and capture every possible particle view, an initial set of 350,000 potential particles (referred to as \u2018peaks\u2019 in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) were picked using DoGPicker (<a href=\"#bib63\">Voss et al., 2009</a>) with a broad threshold range for subsequent 2D classification using RELION (<a href=\"#bib56\">Scheres, 2012</a>). 2D classification was able to remove the large number of false positives and aggregates, and resulted in\u00a0~35,000 particles with 2D classes in which secondary structure was already apparent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These class averages revealed that the side views also adopted a preferred orientation. Upon imposing C4 symmetry, the angular sampling space was filled in along three orthogonal axes (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), which greatly improved the quality of the 3D reconstruction. The final rounds of refinement with C4 symmetry revealed two 3D classes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The dominant class (EMDB ID: EMD-8470), derived from 20,707 particles had an overall resolution of\u00a0~6.7 \u00c5, and application of a mask improved the resolution of the overall structure to 5.8 \u00c5 and the central Kir6.2 domain to 5.1 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The second class, derived from 14,115 particles, had an overall unmasked resolution of\u00a0~7.6 \u00c5, and masking improved the resolution of the overall structure to 7.2 \u00c5 and for the central Kir6.2 domain to 6.9 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). All resolutions were reported using the 0.143 criterion with gold-standard FSC and phase-randomization correction for the use of masks (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>). Resolution was further confirmed using local-resolution as measured using ResMap (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kucukelbir et al., 2014</a>), and by observing criterion such as helical pitch starting to become visible, and density bumps for some of the larger side chains (see examples shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Maps were B-factor corrected during post-processing using the K2 MTF, and the fitting procedure described by Rosenthal and Henderson (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>). The two 3D classes differ in the cytoplasmic domain of Kir6.2 where a rotation of\u00a0~14\u00b0 relative to each other was observed (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>)."

These regions were removed from the homology models before proceeding with refinement. The TM helices were then manually adjusted in COOT, as a substantial adjustment was needed to move them into density. The domains were then refined in the same steps as outlined for Kir6.2, except that before the final manual adjustments in COOT and final density gradient optimization, a batch of torsion angle simulated annealing optimization was inserted, again using RSRef/CNS and the same torsion angle restraints and NCS constraints. The final model for the ABC core structure contained residues 284\u2013616 (TMD1), 675\u2013739 and 762\u2013930 (NBD1), 981\u20131044 and 1060\u20131321 (TMD2), and 1325\u20131577 (NBD2)."

These domains were therefore modeled de novo. Even though embedded in a micelle, all the transmembrane helices in TMD0 are clearly visible in the density map. The visibility of helical pitch and some side chains allowed confident modeling and refinement of the TM helices. With the predominantly alpha-helical nature of this domain, continuous loop density between most of the TM helices, and the presence of residues with bulky side chains, we were able to build the\u00a0~200 residues of TMD0 with a good degree of confidence. Of less certainty was the L0 region of SUR1 that sits between TMD0 and TMD1. While there was an easily identifiable region of the map corresponding to L0, the scarcity of secondary structures in this region made it difficult to build with the same degree of confidence. This was further complicated by the high likelihood that some of the observed density may be attributable to the ligand GBC, a high affinity antagonist which has been shown to interact with this region (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bryan et al., 2004</a>). Nonetheless, we made a best effort to model the residues in L0 primarily to verify that (1) a plausible model could be built into this density, and (2) that the observed density was sufficient to account for all the amino acids in this loop. The L0 model we built fulfilled both criteria, and as such, allowed for a better interpretation and understanding of the electron density map. We did not, however, attempt to draw any definitive conclusions about specific residues or GBC density from our tentative modeling of L0."

The full final models were refined with all the constraints available in PHENIX real-space refinement: torsion angles, bond lengths, Ramachandran, and secondary structure. This was done initially with side-chains in place to ensure that the refinement did not place residues in implausible configurations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> shows examples of residues that were particularly well-resolved and served as anchor points for building and refining the model). Evaluation of these refined models confirmed that the model could be refined to fit the density quite well while maintaining good stereochemical statistics (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). However, as many of the side chains did not have much, if any, supporting density, a final pass was made throughout the entire model to remove these side-chains prior to PDB deposition (PDB ID: 5TWV). The resulting model was very similar to the full-atom refinement, but had better statistics (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) primarily due to the reduced possibility of clashes."

This is a landmark structure of fascinating, complicated, and an extremely (and increasingly!) biomedically-important macromolecular assembly. The structural analysis is well done and the depth of expertise for the biological interpretation of the structure is readily apparent. Insight is gained into numerous points, including where ATP and Glibenclamide bind the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel and how they affect channel function. As a particularly interesting aspect, the structure illustrates how information about ATP concentrations in the cell, sensed by the ABC protein SUR1 subunits, is communicated to the Kir6.2 channel by TMD0 and the L0 linker."

However, it remains a possibility that the motion is part of a conformational transition between ATP-bound and ATP-unbound states. In our preparation, ATP was present at saturating concentrations, which may prevent complete transition from the ATP-bound state to the ATP-free state. Moreover, the presence of GBC may also prevent complete transition to a second state via interaction between the CTD of Kir6.2 and the TMD0/L0 of SUR1. We decided to note the presence of this second state both because it is an interesting observation, and also because separating out these particles was necessary to reach the higher resolution in the better map. There is likely continuous heterogeneity between the high resolution map and the second lower-resolution map, and there may be more 3-D classes to be distinguished, but this was the best result we could achieve with our current dataset size. As stated in the manuscript, a structure in the absence of ATP in the future will be needed to address these questions. We have now revised the Results section to make it clear that ATP density was present in both classes."

This makes it unlikely that the density we observed was ADP. Biochemical studies using azido-ATP have provided direct evidence that ATP binds to Kir6.2. Moreover, Kir6.2 channels formed in the absence of SUR1 (using a Kir6.2 variant lacking the RKR ER retention signal in the C-terminus) are inhibited by ATP as well as non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues, consistent with direct interaction of Kir6.2 with ATP. These studies, cited in the paragraph discussing the ATP binding site in Kir6.2, support our assumption and interpretation of the bound ATP density. We have now also included these background studies in Introduction to improve clarity."

With regard to the closed Kir6.2 conformation observed, ATP and glibenclamide are two potent channel inhibitors even with physiological PIP<sub>2</sub> present (IC<sub>50</sub>~10\u00b5M and 1nM respectively measured in inside-out patch-clamp recordings).
