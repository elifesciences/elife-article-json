The extent to which the cucullaris muscle is a cranial muscle allied with the gill levators of anamniotes or is instead a trunk muscle is an ongoing debate. Novel computed tomography datasets reveal broad conservation of the cucullaris in gnathostomes, including coelacanth and caecilian, two sarcopterygians previously thought to lack it. In chicken, lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) adjacent to occipital somites is a recently identified embryonic source of cervical musculature. We fate-map this mesoderm in the axolotl (<i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>), which retains external gills, and demonstrate its contribution to posterior gill-levator muscles and the cucullaris. Accordingly, LPM adjacent to the occipital somites should be regarded as posterior cranial mesoderm. The axial position of the head-trunk border in axolotl is congruent between LPM and somitic mesoderm, unlike in chicken and possibly other amniotes."

The extent to which the cucullaris muscle is a cranial muscle allied with the gill levators of anamniotes or is instead a trunk muscle is an ongoing debate. Novel computed tomography datasets reveal broad conservation of the cucullaris in gnathostomes, including coelacanth and caecilian, two sarcopterygians previously thought to lack it. In chicken, lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) adjacent to occipital somites is a recently identified embryonic source of cervical musculature. We fate-map this mesoderm in the axolotl (<i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>), which retains external gills, and demonstrate its contribution to posterior gill-levator muscles and the cucullaris. Accordingly, LPM adjacent to the occipital somites should be regarded as posterior cranial mesoderm. The axial position of the head-trunk border in axolotl is congruent between LPM and somitic mesoderm, unlike in chicken and possibly other amniotes."

It involved expansion of muscles, some derived from the head (cranial muscles) and some from the trunk, to support the skull apart from the pectoral girdle and permit a greater range of movement of the head relative to the rest of the body. Cranial muscles support a variety of functions, including feeding, respiration, vision, facial expression and vocalization. They are distinct from trunk muscles in genetic regulation and susceptibility to disease (<a href=\"#bib47\">Noden, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Noden et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sambasivan et al., 2009</a>; reviewed by <a href=\"#bib4\">Bismuth and Relaix, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Diogo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Noden and Francis-West, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tzahor, 2009</a>). Developmentally, they are non-somitic, arising instead from cranial paraxial and splanchnic mesoderm (<a href=\"#bib8\">Couly et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Noden, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Evans and Noden, 2006</a>; reviewed by <a href=\"#bib49\">Noden and Trainor, 2005</a>).

It is the putative homologue of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid in amniotes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lubosch et al., 1938</a>). In sharks and the Queensland lungfish, the cucullaris elevates the gill arches and protracts\u00a0the pectoral girdle. It originates near the skull and continues caudally and ventrally to insert on the scapular region of the pectoral girdle; a ventral fascicle extends to the posteriormost branchial bar (<a href=\"#bib14\">Edgeworth, 1926</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">1935</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Allis, 1917</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Vetter, 1874</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Greenwood and Lauder, 1981</a>). The cucullaris is a thin muscle, and it can be difficult to visualize its three-dimensional position vis-\u00e0-vis adjacent skeleton and musculature. Hence, it is poorly described in many taxa with regard to both its shape and its relation to other cranial and trunk musculature. It is innervated by the accessory ramus of the vagus (X) nerve in anamniotes, but primarily by the accessory (XI) nerve in amniotes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Edgeworth, 1935</a>). While in chicken the connective-tissue component of hypobranchial muscles and the ventrolateral neck region is derived from neural crest (<a href=\"#bib36\">Le Li\u00e8vre and Le Douarin, 1975</a>), the cucullaris is reported to have somite-derived connective tissue (<a href=\"#bib47\">Noden, 1983</a>).

Historically, the cucullaris was considered a branchiomeric cranial muscle based in part on its anatomical relation to the gill levators (<a href=\"#bib69\">Vetter, 1874</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Edgeworth, 1935</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Piatt, 1938</a>).

To distinguish between these hypotheses, it is important to define the posterior limit of myogenic cranial mesoderm in an organism with a relatively conservative cervical and branchial region. Amniote branchial-arch musculature is reduced in comparison to that of piscine sarcopterygians and aquatic salamanders such as the axolotl, which has a relatively plesiomorphic arrangement of cranial muscle. Moreover, axolotls possess bushy external gills and their associated musculature, which likely were present in the larvae of Paleozoic tetrapods, as well as a robust gill skeleton, which was present in the earliest limbed stem tetrapods (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schoch and Witzmann, 2011</a>)."

In the axolotl, we locate the head-trunk boundary within unsegmented cranial mesoderm. In addition, we use micro-computed tomography (CT) to describe the morphology of the cucullaris and gill levators in a phylogenetically diverse series of gnathostome taxa, including limbless caecilians and the coelacanth, the sister taxon to all other extant lobe-finned fishes. In previous studies, the cucullaris was investigated largely by gross dissection. In many species, however, the cucullaris is a thin, superficial muscle embedded in several layers of fat and connective tissue. It can be difficult to expose without damaging its in situ context with respect to the trunk and the pectoral girdle. Our CT-based reconstructions reveal such three-dimensional relationships without tissue disruption."

                        "text": "In those taxa that have both branchial levators and a cucullaris, the cucullaris consistently appears to be in series with the levators. This suggests that the cucullaris is a serial homolog of the levators, thus supporting a cranial muscle identity of the cucullaris. Likewise, in the axolotl, although the cucullaris in adults assumes a large, triangular 'trapezius-like' morphology, the larval cucullaris is clearly in series with the levators. The ubiquity of the cucullaris further supports the hypothesis that it is a critical component of the head-trunk connection in gnathostomes. To study the development of tissues in the transitional region spanned by the levators and cucullaris, we extend modern fate-mapping techniques and gene-expression analysis of cranial mesoderm to the axolotl. We show that unsegmented mesoderm adjacent to the anterior three somites contributes to the cucullaris as well as to the gill-levator muscles in a manner consistent with their apparent serial homology, which supports categorization of the cucullaris as a branchiomeric muscle. Cranial mesoderm markers, including <i>isl1</i> and <i>tbx1,</i> also are expressed in the developing cucullaris region. We find molecular regionalization of the cranial muscles at stage 40, with distinct expression patterns in the mandibular and hyoid arch musculature. Adductor muscles within the mandibular arch have distinct gene expression patterns as well. We argue that the posterior limit of cranial mesoderm in the axolotl extends caudally to the axial level of somite 3 and that the head-trunk boundary is consistent between the somites and lateral plate mesoderm. We discuss the importance of posterior cranial mesoderm in the evolution of the vertebrate neck."

In Chondrichthyes, such as the chimaera, the cucullaris is a massive muscle that may incorporate anterior gill levators; in this respect, it may not be strictly homologous, in its entirety, with the cucullaris of osteichthyans. In piscine osteichthyans, such as bichir and lungfish, the cucullaris is a thin, strap-like muscle, sometimes called the 'protractor pectoralis' (e.g., <a href=\"#bib22\">Greenwood and Lauder, 1981</a>). It diverges from the anterior gill levators, but otherwise it is in series with them, is located in the same connective tissue sheath, and shares muscle fibers with the immediately anterior levators. It originates from the posterior region of the head and inserts on the pectoral girdle and, when present, the fifth gill arch. In some amphibians and in amniotes, the cucullaris is a large wedge-shaped muscle, sometimes termed the trapezius (<a href=\"#bib52\">Owen, 1866</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Edgeworth, 1935</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gegenbaur et al., 1878</a>).

Based on novel dissections, <a href=\"#bib22\">Greenwood and Lauder (1981)</a> reported the cucullaris absent from the coelacanth. <a href=\"#bib44\">Millot and Anthony (1958)</a>, however, had earlier briefly described in the coelacanth a fifth gill levator that originates on the anocleithrum of the pectoral girdle, unlike the first four gill levators, which originate in the otic region. We examined this muscle in both a CT scan of a contrast-stained coelacanth pup and an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of an adult. The muscle in these specimens is larger than previously described, with several heads originating on the pectoral girdle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). It is angled differently from the other levators, but its fibers remain in close association with them and extend from the anocleithrum to insert on the fifth ceratobranchial. In the adult, an anterior portion of this muscle extends dorsally to attach on the fascia of the epaxial musculature (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>). Based on its morphology and location, we regard the fifth gill levator as the homolog of the cucullaris. Accordingly, the coelacanth cucullaris retains the ancestral connection between the posteriormost branchial bar and the pectoral girdle, which is seen in at least some sharks and lungfish (<a href=\"#bib14\">Edgeworth, 1926</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">1935</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Allis, 1917</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Vetter, 1874</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Greenwood and Lauder, 1981</a>). Even though actinopterygians lack an ossified fifth gill arch, the cucullaris in these taxa sometimes joins the fibers of the posteriormost gill levator (<a href=\"#bib22\">Greenwood and Lauder, 1981</a>). Although the cucullaris in the coelacanth does not attach to the head, it retains a division that extends rostrally, terminating upon the dorsal fascia posterior to the cranium; it also retains the ancestral connection between the pectoral girdle and the cranial skeleton by its attachment to the branchial skeleton."

The muscle is also termed the m. cephalodorsosubpharyngeus (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wilkinson and Nussbaum, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lawson, 1965</a>). Based on our examination, the m. levator arcus branchiales complex is a triangular structure that originates from the otic capsule and dorsal trunk muscle fascia and inserts ventrally on the the posteriormost ceratobranchial (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,I</a>). A posterior division of the muscle, the pars posterosuperficialis (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wilkinson and Nussbaum, 1997</a>), inserts on the fascia separating the rectus abdominus from the interhyoideus. Based on these topographic relationships, we homologize the posterior division of the m. levator arcus branchialis complex with the cucullaris. It is unclear if a portion of the anterior division should also be considered part of the cucullaris, connecting to the adult hyobranchial skeleton."

In juvenile axolotls, the cucullaris resembles the condition in bichir; it is morphologically similar to and in series with the anterior gill levators, whereas in adults it expands into a broad, thin sheet (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Given the conservative morphology of branchiomeric musculature in the axolotl (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ericsson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ericsson and Olsson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Ziermann and Diogo, 2013</a>), we began fate-mapping head mesoderm that contributes to the pharyngeal arches. In chicken and axolotl, mesoderm from somites 1 and 2 contributes to the cucullaris (<a href=\"#bib55\">Piekarski and Olsson, 2007</a>). In chicken, however, the majority of the cucullaris is derived from lateral plate mesoderm adjacent to the occipital somites (<a href=\"#bib65\">Theis et al., 2010</a>). Consequently, we suspected that the axolotl cucullaris might also have a dual origin from both somitic and unsegmented mesoderm."

These muscles displayed normal innervation from the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2212C\u2019\u2019</a>) and the facial nerve, respectively. Local cues appear sufficient to pattern myogenic lateral plate mesoderm from the cucullaris region and to promote mandibular or hyoid arch muscle development."

Accordingly, we propose the fifth gill levator of the coelacanth to be homologous to the cucullaris, which, as in some sharks, rays and lungfish, attaches the pectoral girdle to the posteriormost gill bar (<a href=\"#bib15\">Edgeworth, 1935</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Greenwood and Lauder, 1981</a>). We regard this interpretation of data from coelacanth, viz., the cucullaris has reduced its dorsal attachment to the head/epaxial muscle fascia, more parsimonious than a previous interpretation that the cucullaris is absent and that a gill levator has entirely shifted its origin from the head to the pectoral girdle (<a href=\"#bib22\">Greenwood and Lauder, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Millot and Anthony, 1958</a>). In larval <i>Ichthyophis kohtaoensis</i>, a caecilian, the fourth gill levator is substantially larger than the anterior three levators (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kleinteich and Haas, 2007</a>). The cucullaris could potentially develop from the caudalmost gill levator, as has been suggested in urodeles (<a href=\"#bib15\">Edgeworth, 1935</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Ziermann and Diogo, 2013</a>). The cucullaris of caecilians, lacking an insertion to the absent shoulder girdle, instead has evolved a patent connection between the otic capsule (as well as the dorsal trunk fascia) and fascia associated with ventral trunk musculature. It is uncertain if the anterior portion of the levator arcus branchiales complex, which inserts on the posteriormost gillbar, is also part of the cucullaris or instead represents only gill levators that did not degenerate following metamorphosis. In the former case, this unusual configuration might express an ancestral potential of the cucullaris to attach to the gill skeleton, and it evokes reports that the paired fin/limb apparatus has surprising developmental resemblance to the gill arches (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gillis et al., 2009</a>)."

In placoderms, for example, it may have depressed the head (<a href=\"#bib66\">Trinajstic et al., 2013</a>). The morphology of the cucullaris in sharks and rays suggests the muscle in gnathostomes originates ancestrally from the pectoral girdle and inserts on two parts of the cranial skeleton: the posterior gill bar and the caudal region of the head. The connection to the gill arches was likely lost in early tetrapods (but possibly later reappeared in caecilians), while an alternate attachment to the clavicle evolved in some lineages. The cucullaris is purportedly absent in turtles and snakes, but recent work suggests that it may be present in both groups. In turtles, it has been proposed that the muscle originates on the shell (carapace), which incorporates parts of the pectoral girdle (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lyson et al., 2013</a>). In snakes, the pectoral girdle is absent and the origin of the cucullaris has concomitantly shifted to the body wall (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tsuihiji et al., 2006</a>)."

An origin from both the caudal branchial levator and somites was suggested in the spotted salamander, <i>Ambystoma maculatum</i>, based on serial sections and dissection (<a href=\"#bib54\">Piatt, 1938</a>). Our finding that unsegmented mesoderm adjacent to the anterior somites forms the posterior gill-levator muscles, a laryngeal muscle, the levatores et depressores branchiarum and the cucullaris indicates that the posterior limit of cranial mesoderm is at somite 3. The presence of labeled cranial mesoderm cells in a laryngeal muscle in axolotl betrays the deep phylogenetic conservation of a relationship between the cucullaris and laryngeal muscles, which was revealed in a recent analysis demonstrating that mouse laryngeal muscles are clonally related to the trapezius and absent following mutation of the gene <i>Tbx1</i> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lescroart et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, expression of the genes <i>isl1</i> and <i>tbx1</i> in the gill-levator region suggests these muscles develop through the cranial muscle regulatory network, consistent with their classical anatomical classification as cranial muscles."

Surprisingly, our data reveal that differentiation of mandibular adductor muscles is present in amphibians at the level of gene expression. At stage 40, <i>isl1</i> is expressed in the superficial anterior adductor, while <i>lhx2</i> is expressed in the external adductor. In mouse, the LIM homeodomain gene <i>Isl1</i> is required for normal second heart field (SHF) development and its expression in SHF progenitors is downregulated following differentiation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2003</a>). Genetic fate mapping in mouse demonstrates a large contribution of <i>Isl1</i>-positive cells to the ventral intermandibular muscle and the cucullaris (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nathan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Theis et al., 2010</a>). In the axolotl at stage 40, <i>pitx2</i> is expressed in hyoid arch and tongue musculature but is not in the gill musculature. Taken together, these findings underscore the regionalization of developmental programs that underlies cranial muscle formation, both among pharyngeal arches and even within the mandibular adductor complex. Moreover, the broad phylogenetic diversity of the model species involved suggests that such regionalization may be an ancestral feature of tetrapod vertebrates that is retained in living taxa and may also exist in their piscine outgroups."

Before grafting, embryos were decapsulated manually by using watchmaker forceps and then staged (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bordzilovskaya et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nye et al., 2003</a>). Explants of unsegmented cranial mesoderm (stages 18\u201322) from donor embryos were grafted unilaterally into stage-matched hosts in place of comparable regions that had been extirpated. Stage-matched donors were of similar size and form. In heterotopic transplantations, anterior cranial mesoderm from regions that contribute to mandibular or hyoid arch musculature was partially extirpated in hosts. In one set of heterotopic experiments, GFP+ mesoderm adjacent to somite 2 was moved into either region 1 or region 2 of host anterior cranial mesoderm (integrating into either the mandibular or hyoid arch). In a second set of experiments, GFP+ mesoderm adjacent to somite 5 was transplanted into host anterior cranial mesoderm."

It provides a review of classical ideas as well as recent developmental and molecular studies that impact this subject, most specifically the contrast in genetic regulation of cranial versus trunk muscles. The classical literature holds some controversy about the branchiomeric origin of the cucullaris muscle and its phylogenetic distribution. That muscle and its homologues are the major focus of this study. CT scans of numerous taxa are included to argue that the cucullaris is a universal feature of gnathostomes. The authors present orthotopic transplant experiments in axolotl to build a fate map confirming that the posterior gill levators and the cucullaris in this amphibian are derived from lateral plate mesoderm adjacent to somites 1-3. They also preform heterotopic transplants of LPM from different axial levels to test for myogenic properties in response to cranial versus trunk signaling environments. They demonstrate the ability of anterior LPM cells to respond to cranial signals and differentiate as muscle where as in contrast, LPM posterior to somite 3 does not respond in the same site, and fails to differentiate as muscle. The authors conclude that the true head/trunk boundary occurs in both somites and LPM behind somite 3 in axolotl."

The sentence \u201cBased on these data, it is unknown whether the lateral plate origin of the cucullaris is the result of a posterior shift of the head myogenic program or instead represents head mesoderm that spread caudally into the region adjacent to the anterior somites\u201d, asks a specific question, but this gets lost in subsequent discussion and CT scans- development and anatomy are not well integrated, giving the impression that there are two papers cobbled together. This requires revision.</i>"

We have enlarged individual panels in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> to make them appear less crowded and to allow features on individual panels to be discerned more easily. In addition, CT data from the axolotl has been incorporated into <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> to create a more effective transition between CT and fate-mapping data. We added an optical projection tomography scan of a juvenile (stage 53) axolotl to the same figure to more readily contrast the morphology of the cucullaris between juveniles and adults. The question in the Introduction has been moved to a new paragraph to emphasize its importance, and it is now addressed more explicitly in the Results (beginning of the section, \u201cMesoderm adjacent to anterior somites forms the cucullaris and gill levators\u201d)."

If the technique is used in order to avoid destruction of rare specimens during dissection, maybe they would seem worthwhile. What is described in the text for the coelacanth is not clearly visible in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>.</i> We added several sentences to the Introduction that explain the utility of CT/MRI scans for examining the cucullaris, e.g., they accurately depict the muscle\u2019s three-dimensional morphology without damaging rare specimens (especially the adult and pup coelacanth). The criteria we use for muscle identification include the specific attachment points (origin and insertion) as well as overall morphology (e.g., shape) and fiber orientation. In the case of the coelacanth, we consider it more parsimonious to conclude that the cucullaris has reduced its dorsal attachment to the head (while maintaining the ancestral connection between the posteriormost branchial bar and pectoral girdle) than it is to propose that a gill levator has gained an entirely new origin from the pectoral girdle. We have made these points more explicit in the Results and Discussion."
