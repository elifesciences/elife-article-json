Using a three-generation forward genetic screen in mice we have identified Megf8 as a novel modifier of BMP4 signaling in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons. Loss of Megf8 disrupts axon guidance in the peripheral nervous system and leads to defects in development of the limb, heart, and left-right patterning, defects that resemble those observed in <i>Bmp4</i> loss-of-function mice. <i>Bmp4</i> is expressed in a pattern that defines the permissive field for the peripheral projections of TG axons and mice lacking BMP signaling in sensory neurons exhibit TG axon defects that resemble those observed in <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos. Furthermore, TG axon growth is robustly inhibited by BMP4 and this inhibition is dependent on Megf8. Thus, our data suggest that Megf8 is involved in mediating BMP4 signaling and guidance of developing TG axons."

Using a three-generation forward genetic screen in mice we have identified Megf8 as a novel modifier of BMP4 signaling in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons. Loss of Megf8 disrupts axon guidance in the peripheral nervous system and leads to defects in development of the limb, heart, and left-right patterning, defects that resemble those observed in <i>Bmp4</i> loss-of-function mice. <i>Bmp4</i> is expressed in a pattern that defines the permissive field for the peripheral projections of TG axons and mice lacking BMP signaling in sensory neurons exhibit TG axon defects that resemble those observed in <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos. Furthermore, TG axon growth is robustly inhibited by BMP4 and this inhibition is dependent on Megf8. Thus, our data suggest that Megf8 is involved in mediating BMP4 signaling and guidance of developing TG axons."

BMPs are members of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily of secreted growth factors and are required for a wide range of developmental functions including gastrulation, mesoderm formation, neural patterning, left-right asymmetry, skeletal and limb development, kidney formation, and heart development (<a href=\"#bib32\">Zhao, 2003</a>). In addition to patterning, BMPs also function as axon guidance molecules. BMP7 in the spinal cord roof plate repels axons of developing commissural neurons thus orienting their growth toward the floor plate (<a href=\"#bib2\">Augsburger et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Butler and Dodd, 2003</a>). Moreover, BMP4 is a target-derived cue that augments development of somatosensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). BMP4 is expressed in the developing craniofacial region and signals retrogradely to coordinate differential gene expression and patterning along the dorsoventral axis of the trigeminal ganglion (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hodge et al., 2007</a>). Furthermore, BMP4 appears to have a trophic effect on TG and DRG neurons as altering the level of BMP4 expression in the skin leads to changes in the peripheral innervation and number of sensory neurons found in both the TG and DRG (<a href=\"#bib11\">Guha et al., 2004</a>). Thus, BMP4 signaling contributes to sensory neuron maturation and target innervation; however, the mechanisms by which BMP4 acts on developing sensory neurons to promote axonal growth remain to be elucidated."

One of the lines that emerged from this screen has a mutation in the gene <i>Megf8</i>; loss of Megf8 function leads to defasciculation of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve as well as defects in development of the heart, limb, skeleton, and left-right asymmetry. Given these phenotypes, we hypothesized that Megf8 interacts with the BMP4 signaling pathway. Indeed, loss of BMP signaling in trigeminal neurons leads to ophthalmic nerve defects that resemble those observed in <i>Megf8</i> loss-of-function mouse lines. Furthermore, TG axon growth is robustly inhibited by BMP4, and this inhibition is dependent on Megf8 expression. Taken together, these results show that Megf8 is a novel mediator of BMP signaling and is required for guidance of developing TG axons by target-derived BMP4."

One of the mutant mouse lines, Line 687, exhibits severe defasciculation of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. In Line 687 mutants, the two major branches of the ophthalmic nerve initially form properly as tightly bound fascicles; however, as the axons extend into the target field, they prematurely defasciculate within the face (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We mapped the genetic lesion responsible for the phenotype in Line 687 to a 2.6 Mb region of Chromosome 7 between <i>rs3715453</i> and <i>D7JHMI24</i> that contains 76 open reading frames (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Based on bioinformatic analysis of genes within this region, we sequenced the 5\u2032UTRs and coding exons of nine genes: <i>Tmsb10</i>, <i>Dmrtc2</i>, <i>Zfp574</i>, <i>Zfp526</i>, <i>Gsk3a</i>, <i>Erf</i>, <i>Megf8</i>, <i>BC024561</i>, and <i>2310004L02Rik</i>.

Given the broad expression of <i>Megf8</i> in a wide range of tissues during development, we next asked whether these defects, and in particular the TG defect, are due to a cell autonomous function of Megf8 in sensory neurons. To address this question, we crossed the conditional <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>Flox</i></sup> line with the transgenic <i>Wnt1-Cre</i> line (<a href=\"#bib6\">Danielian et al., 1998</a>) in which cre recombinase is expressed in neural crest-derived cells, including sensory neurons. <i>Wnt1-Cre</i>-mediated conditional deletion of <i>Megf8</i> leads to defasciculation of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, phenocopying <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> and <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>L1775P/L1775P</i></sup> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Although all <i>Wnt1-Cre;Megf8</i><sup><i>Flox/Flox</i></sup> embryos showed defasciculation of the ophthalmic branch, the severity of the phenotype was more variable than in <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> and <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>L1775P/L1775P</i></sup> embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>), and in a few embryos the ophthalmic branch defasciculated completely around the eye and failed to project into the periphery (data not shown). These findings suggest that Megf8 mediates guidance of developing TG axons in a cell autonomous manner. <i>Wnt1-Cre;Megf8</i><sup><i>Flox/Flox</i></sup> embryos do not exhibit a defect in radial/ulnar nerve development, however, suggesting that Megf8\u2019s role in spinal nerve axon guidance is non-cell autonomous (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Of note, <i>Wnt1-Cre;Megf8</i><sup><i>Flox/Flox</i></sup> embryos do not exhibit the limb immaturity seen in <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos. Thus, one possibility is that the radial/ulnar nerve phenotype observed in <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos is secondary to an overall delay in limb development. An alternative explanation is that Megf8 may be required in spinal motor neurons, and that a loss of motor neuron axon guidance in <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos causes a subsequent disruption in DRG sensory axon guidance; this indirect effect of Megf8 on DRG sensory neuron axon guidance would not be evident in <i>Wnt1-Cre;Megf8</i><sup><i>Flox/Flox</i></sup> embryos."

The spectrum of phenotypes seen in <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos is strikingly similar to that observed when BMP signaling is disrupted (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). BMPs are members of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily of extracellular ligands and have been implicated in a wide range of developmental functions. We noted that loss of BMP4, and to a lesser extent BMP2 and BMP7, results in similar defects as those observed in the <i>Megf8</i> mutants. <i>Bmp4</i> and <i>Bmp7</i> loss-of-function mouse lines exhibit pre-axial polydactyly (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dudley et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Luo et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dunn et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Selever et al., 2004</a>). <i>Bmp4</i> null embryos also display disrupted left-right patterning and loss of normal rightward heart looping (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fujiwara et al., 2002</a>). Loss of BMP4, or its receptor BMPR2, results in a wide range of heart defects, including atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, atrioventricular septal defects, and abnormal positioning or septation of the outflow tract (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jiao et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Liu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beppu et al., 2009</a>); several of these cardiac phenotypes are exacerbated by a concomitant loss of BMP2 or BMP7 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Rivera-Feliciano and Tabin, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Goldman et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, BMP4 signaling is required for dorsoventral patterning of the TG (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hodge et al., 2007</a>), and modifying BMP4 expression in the skin leads to changes in the peripheral innervation and survival of sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Guha et al., 2004</a>). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that loss of either BMP4 or Megf8 leads to a similar spectrum of defects in the limb, left-right asymmetry, and heart, and that both BMP4 and Megf8 are required for normal development of the TG. Based on these functional similarities, we hypothesized that Megf8 interacts with, or is a component of, the BMP4 signaling pathway, and that this interaction is required for axon guidance and peripheral target innervation by TG sensory neurons."

To do so, we utilized a <i>Bmp4</i><sup><i>lacZ</i></sup> mouse line in which a <i>lacZ</i> reporter cassette was inserted into the <i>Bmp4</i> locus (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lawson et al., 1999</a>). Using whole-mount \u03b2-galactosidase and neurofilament co-staining, we were able to examine the expression pattern of <i>Bmp4</i> relative to developing TG axons. At E10.5, <i>Bmp4</i> is expressed strongly in the eye and also in the dorsal portion of the face above the eye (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These two areas of BMP4 expression flank a narrow corridor through which the developing ophthalmic nerve projects; this expression pattern suggests that BMP4 may act as a repulsive guidance cue for developing TG axons. One day later, at E11.5, the TG axons have extended into their peripheral targets and have bifurcated into frontal and nasociliary nerves. At this stage, <i>Bmp4</i> expression is striking; as the ophthalmic branch extends beyond the eye, the nasociliary nerve branches in a region devoid of <i>Bmp4</i> expression and then immediately projects nasally as a tightly bundled fascicle through an area of strong <i>Bmp4</i> expression while the axons of the frontal branch extend rostrally. Remarkably, the pattern of <i>Bmp4</i> expression is disrupted in <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos. In the absence of Megf8, <i>Bmp4</i> expression is lost at the point of defasciculation of the ophthalmic branch into the frontal and nasociliary branches (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) suggesting that axonal innervation of the target region is necessary for proper expression of <i>Bmp4</i> and that the absence of this BMP signaling leads to defasciculation of the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve. An alternative explanation is that Megf8 is required in cells of the craniofacial target tissues to regulate <i>Bmp4</i> expression. ISH shows that <i>Megf8</i> is expressed in craniofacial tissues as well as the TG, although <i>Megf8</i> expression is far more robust in neurons of the TG (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Interestingly, in <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos <i>Bmp4</i> expression is disrupted exclusively in the area around the ophthalmic branch but is intact throughout the rest of the embryo (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The embryos were next washed in five 45 min incubations in TNT (10 mM Tris-base, 154 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and then incubated for 3 days in primary antibody solution, which consisted of 2H3 anti-neurofilament ascites antibody (3.8 mg/ml stock, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) diluted 1:5000 in TNT with 0.02% sodium azide, 4% milk, 5% DMSO, and 2% sheep serum (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Following primary antibody, embryos were washed in TNT (five time, 45 min each), and then incubated for 2 days in secondary sheep anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:250 in TNT with 0.02% sodium azide, 4% BSA, 5% DMSO, and 2% sheep serum. The embryos were washed in TBS for four 45 min incubations followed by one overnight incubation. The following morning, the horseradish peroxidase reactions were developed with diaminobenzidine, washed in five incubations of TBS for 5 min each, and dehydrated through methanol as done previously (50%, 80%, 100% methanol). To visualize the staining, embryos were cleared in 1:2 benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate."

The ophthalmic branch defasciculation was assessed by counting the number of branches that emerged from the branch point of the nasociliary nerve distal to the eye. The outgrowth of all three trigeminal nerve branches (ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular) was quantified by measuring the distance the branch travelled into the peripheral tissue after exiting the TG. This distance was then divided by the outgrowth measured in a littermate control in order to calculate the relative outgrowth of the nerve. In order to assess for possible defasciculation in the maxillary nerve, the area of the maxillary branch was measured beginning at the point of exit from the TG and extending to its innervation of peripheral tissues. This area was then divided by the area measured in a littermate control to calculate the relative area of the maxillary branch."

By screening for peripheral nerve defects after ENU mutagenesis, the authors have identified a mutation in the <i>Megf8</i> gene. Mutation of the human homologue (Carpenter syndrome) is associated with dramatic developmental abnormalities. Here, the authors describe the cloning of <i>Megf8</i> as well as the careful and thorough characterization of its loss-of-function. Megf8 appears to be a novel receptor with critical roles in axon guidance, the establishment of left-right asymmetry and limb, skeletal, and heart development. Because the mouse and human phenotypes bear similarity to loss of BMP4 signaling, the authors performed a comprehensive analysis of the requirement for Megf8 in development in comparison to the requirement for <i>Bmp4</i>."

In the absence of either Megf8 or BmprII, this branch is severely defasciculated. Moreover, loss of Megf8 results in the loss of <i>Bmp4</i> expression flanking the ophthalmic branch, in the region where the most profound defasciculation defects are observed. Taken together, these studies identify a novel putative regulator of BMP signaling and raise important questions about the non-autonomous control of <i>Bmp4</i> expression by Megf8."

One possibility is that the foreshortening is secondary to the defasciculation. In other words, individual ophthalmic axons grow to the same length (or longer) in <i>Megf8</i> mutants, but because the axons aberrantly extend into surrounding tissues the overall path of the nerve appears shorter. The other possibility is that in addition to its role in mediating BMP4 inhibitory cues, Megf8 also facilitates the growth of ophthalmic axons into the periphery and thus these axons are undergrown in <i>Megf8</i> mutants. This second possibility is consistent with the phenotype observed in the spinal nerves, which are undergrown in <i>Megf8</i> null embryos when compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,D</a>). In addition, the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve is slightly undergrown in <i>Megf8</i> mutants compared to control (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> legend). Taken together, these results suggest a role for Megf8 in promoting axon growth of TG and DRG sensory neurons. However, our data do not determine whether this occurs through modification of BMP4 signaling."

Either BMP4 expression is dependent on signaling from incoming TG axons (which is disrupted by defasciculation in the <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> embryo) or Megf8 expressed in the craniofacial target region regulates BMP4 expression. This is an interesting point, as we know from our ISH results that <i>Megf8</i> is expressed in TG neurons as well as in the developing craniofacial area. Because neural crest cells contribute to this developing craniofacial area, the <i>Wnt1-Cre</i>; <i>Megf8</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup> embryo unfortunately does not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities."

As we have shown, <i>BMP4</i> expression in <i>Megf8</i> null embryos is only disrupted around the TG ophthalmic branch; it is intact in all other areas of the embryo including the DRG, heart, and limbs. These findings suggest that Megf8 modifies BMP4 signaling by acting on the BMP4 ligand/receptor complex or downstream components of the signaling pathway, not through modifying expression of <i>BMP4</i> itself. Indeed, this is consistent with our in vitro findings (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), in which we found that in the presence of exogenous BMP4 ligand, <i>Megf8</i> null axons respond poorly to BMP4 as an inhibitory cue. If Megf8\u2019s role in BMP4 signaling is primarily to modify <i>BMP4</i> expression, one would expect that <i>Megf8</i> null axons would still be inhibited by exogenous BMP4 ligand, unlike our results in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. In fact, we were surprised to find that BMP4 expression is disrupted around the TG ophthalmic nerve. We suggest that this finding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) in conjunction with our in vitro analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) indicates that Megf8 modifies BMP4 signaling in TG ophthalmic axons in two ways: 1) Megf8 expressed in the axon is required to mediate the BMP4 inhibitory cue and 2) loss of Meg8 in the axon, loss of Megf8 in the surrounding craniofacial tissue, or loss of normal TG axon extension (secondary to loss of Megf8) disrupts BMP4 expression.
