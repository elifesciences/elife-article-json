                    "text": "Stress is a potent modulator of the mammalian brain. The highly conserved stress hormone response influences many brain regions, particularly the hippocampus, a region important for memory function. The effect of acute stress on the unique population of adult neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) that resides in the adult hippocampus is unclear. We found that acute stress increased hippocampal cell proliferation and astrocytic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression. The effect of acute stress occurred independent of basolateral amygdala neural input and was mimicked by treating isolated NPCs with conditioned media from corticosterone-treated primary astrocytes. Neutralization of FGF2 revealed that astrocyte-secreted FGF2 mediated stress-hormone-induced NPC proliferation. 2 weeks, but not 2 days, after acute stress, rats also showed enhanced fear extinction memory coincident with enhanced activation of newborn neurons. Our findings suggest a beneficial role for brief stress on the hippocampus and improve understanding of the adaptive capacity of the brain."

The highly conserved stress hormone response influences many brain regions, particularly the hippocampus, a region important for memory function. The effect of acute stress on the unique population of adult neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) that resides in the adult hippocampus is unclear. We found that acute stress increased hippocampal cell proliferation and astrocytic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression. The effect of acute stress occurred independent of basolateral amygdala neural input and was mimicked by treating isolated NPCs with conditioned media from corticosterone-treated primary astrocytes. Neutralization of FGF2 revealed that astrocyte-secreted FGF2 mediated stress-hormone-induced NPC proliferation. 2 weeks, but not 2 days, after acute stress, rats also showed enhanced fear extinction memory coincident with enhanced activation of newborn neurons. Our findings suggest a beneficial role for brief stress on the hippocampus and improve understanding of the adaptive capacity of the brain."

Just over 100 years ago, psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dodson suggested that cognitive performance improves as stress increases, although it falls off again if stress levels continue to rise. The hippocampus is a key brain region for both memory and the regulation of emotion, and is highly sensitive to the main class of stress hormones, glucocorticoids. One particular subregion of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, contains a high density of glucocorticoid receptors, and is also notable for being one of only two regions in the adult mammalian brain that can give rise to new neurons via a process called neurogenesis."

In both cases, the enhanced neurogenesis was accompanied by increased expression of a growth factor called FGF2, which is produced by glial cells called astrocytes."

The effect of acute stress on neurogenesis, however, is unclear. While early work indicated suppression of proliferation following acute stress or GC injection (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cameron and Gould, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gould et al., 1997</a>), subsequent studies have yielded mixed results, often reporting no change in proliferation following a variety of acute stressors (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thomas et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Thomas et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dagyte et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hanson et al., 2011</a>).

Indeed, a number of interventions that stimulate GC release such as acute exercise (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kronenberg et al., 2006</a>) and acute sexual experience (<a href=\"#bib31\">Leuner et al., 2010</a>) actually increase neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus.

We found that acute stress or corticosterone (CORT, the primary rat GC) administration increased dorsal but not ventral hippocampus cell proliferation in adult rats. This increase was not dependent on input from the BLA and was accompanied by an increase in FGF2 expression in dorsal hippocampal astrocytes. Furthermore, we show that astrocyte-secreted FGF2 is necessary for CORT-induced enhancement in NPC proliferation in vitro. 2 weeks after acute stress, when newborn neurons are first becoming functional, we also find enhancement in hippocampus-dependent memory accompanied by enhanced activation of newborn neurons. These findings have important implications for understanding regulation of hippocampal plasticity in the face of environmental challenge and in distinguishing adaptive vs pathological stress responses. Moreover, they suggest that stress effects on adult neurogenesis may follow an inverted U function similar to that already demonstrated for hippocampal memory function (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lupien and McEwen, 1997</a>)."

                                "text": "To investigate the effect of acute stress on adult neurogenesis in the DG (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), we chose three common models of acute stress in rodents: 30 min novel environment, 30 min footshock or 3 hr immobilization. Rats were handled for 5 days prior to stress exposure then perfused 3 hr after the beginning of the stressor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Immobilization stress significantly increased the number of cells immunopositive for the proliferation marker Ki67 in the dorsal DG 3.23-fold above control (27.51 \u00b1 2.74 control vs 88.99 \u00b1 12.49 immob) while novel environment or footshock did not significantly alter Ki67+ count compared to control (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Plasma CORT was significantly elevated above control levels both 30 min and 3 hr after stressor initiation in immobilized rats but not in novel environment- or footshock-exposed rats (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This finding suggested that an increase in CORT might underlie the immobilization-induced increase in DG proliferation. To test that hypothesis, we next habituated handled rats to daily oil injections for 3 days, injected them with exogenous CORT (0, 5 or 40 mg/kg body weight) and assessed cell proliferation 3 hr later (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). 40 mg/kg CORT significantly increased the number of Ki67+ proliferative cells in the dorsal DG 1.92-fold above oil-injected controls (26.19 \u00b1 2.83 0 mg/kg CORT vs 50.29 \u00b1 7.74 40 mg/kg CORT; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E</a>). Plasma CORT levels were also consistently elevated 30 min and 3 hr after injection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), similar to the levels seen in immobilized rats. Notably, injection of 5 mg/kg CORT yielded similar plasma CORT levels to footshock (approximately 119 and 121 ng/ml, respectively) and also did not produce an increase in the numbers of Ki67+ cells. If rats were not habituated to injection, no difference in cell proliferation was found (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,K</a>). We next assessed short-term survival of newly-born cells following acute stress. 3 hr after the start of immobilization or CORT injection, rats were injected with the proliferative marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) then perfused 24 hr later. Both immobilization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,I</a>) and 40 mg/kg CORT injection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>) significantly increased the number of cells immunopositive for BrdU surviving 24 hr after termination of the stressor in the dorsal DG by 1.92 and 1.48-fold, respectively (34.88 \u00b1 8.70 control vs 68.96 \u00b1 10.23 immob; 39.80 \u00b1 6.89 0 mg/kg CORT vs 58.95 mg/kg CORT)."

In addition, we have previously shown that BLA input regulates adult DG neurogenesis under basal conditions and is required for the activation of newborn neurons in a fear conditioning paradigm (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kirby et al., 2012b</a>). To test whether BLA input is necessary for the acute stress-induced increase in proliferation, we performed unilateral excitotoxic lesions of BLA in adult rats (as described in [<a href=\"#bib21\">Kirby et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2012b</a>]). Animals were then exposed to immobilization stress or no stress control (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). At the end of the stressor, each rat received a BrdU injection and was perfused 2 hr later. Plasma CORT response to immobilization was similar in lesioned and sham-operated rats (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), suggesting intact hormonal stress response in BLA-lesioned, immobilized rats. Consistent with our findings in intact rats, sham-operated immobilized rats had a significant 2.6-fold increase in BrdU+ proliferative cells over no stress controls (6.37 \u00b1 1.14 control vs 16.69 \u00b1 2.11 immob; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

This was accomplished by quantifying the response of isolated adult rat hippocampal NPCs grown in vitro (as described in <a href=\"#bib15\">Gage, 2000</a>) to acute CORT exposure. NPCs were FGF2 deprived for 24 hr then treated with 1 \u03bcM CORT (equivalent to approximately 350 ng/ml, the level measured in plasma of immobilized rats) or EtOH vehicle in either high (20 ng/ml) or low (0 ng/ml) FGF2. After 3 hr, BrdU was added to the cells and they were fixed 2 hr later (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Cultured rat hippocampal NPCs depend on FGF2 signaling for proliferation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chipperfield et al., 2002</a>). We found that while high FGF2 increased the percentage of proliferating BrdU+ NPCs over low FGF2 (1.21-fold in EtOH, 1.48-fold in 1 \u03bcM CORT), exposure to CORT did not affect the percent of proliferative cells in either high or low FGF2 media as compared to vehicle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These data indicate that NPCs do not respond to acute CORT in isolation, but likely rely on input from another cell type in the neurogenic niche. A growing body of work indicates that astrocytes can strongly regulate NPC dynamics through secreted factors (<a href=\"#bib52\">Song et al., 2002</a>), so we next tested whether astrocytes might participate in the regulation of NPCs in response to CORT. We treated primary hippocampal astrocytes cultured as described in (<a href=\"#bib38\">McCarthy and de Vellis, 1980</a>) with 1 \u03bcM CORT or EtOH vehicle for 3 hr then extracted astrocyte conditioned media (ACM). When administered to isolated NPCs, CORT-treated ACM increased the percent of BrdU+ NPCs significantly over EtOH-treated coculture media (CoC) control by 1.52-fold (29.56 \u00b1 2.81 CoC-EtOH vs 44.93 \u00b1 2.82 ACM-1 \u03bcM CORT; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>).

Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bhatnagar et al., 1997</a>), FGF2-immunoreactive cells were found throughout the DG and the hilus, with staining primarily in the cell body and nucleus. The DG is primarily composed of granule neurons and while almost every cell expressed FGF2, we found very few GFAP+ cells within the DG as expected. Mean optical density (with background correction) throughout the Z-stack of FGF2 expression in the DG revealed no effect of stress or CORT injection on DG FGF2 expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,D</a>). In the hilus, a mixture of GFAP+ and GFAP- cells was found, with almost all GFAP+ cells being FGF2+. By quantifying integrated optical density of individual FGF2+ cells that were either GFAP+ or GFAP\u2212, we found that both immobilization and 40 mg/kg CORT injection increased FGF2 signal in GFAP+ cells significantly over their respective control groups (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,D</a>). No effect of immobilization or CORT was observed in GFAP\u2212 cells in the hilus (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>).

Consistent with previous work (<a href=\"#bib14\">Forget et al., 2006</a>), media from untreated astrocytes showed no detectable FGF2 (0.12 \u00b1 0.46 pg/ml). In contrast, astrocytes treated with 1 \u03bcM CORT for 3 hr secreted 3.5 \u00b1 0.68 pg/ml FGF2 protein (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). We next tested whether levels of FGF2 as low as 4 pg/ml were sufficient to stimulate NPC proliferation. Treating with 4 pg/ml rat recombinant FGF2 caused a significant 1.39-fold increase in BrdU labeling compared to vehicle (0 pg/ml FGF2), suggesting that the levels of FGF2 present in CORT-ACM were sufficient to stimulate NPC proliferation (11.95 \u00b1 1.22% BrdU+, 0 pg/ml; 16.65 \u00b1 1.72% BrdU+, 4 pg/ml, p=0.04). We next investigated whether blocking FGF2 function could prevent acute stress-induced enhancement of NPC proliferation using a neutralizing antibody against FGF2 (nAb). An ELISA for rat FGF2 revealed that the nAb decreased available FGF2 over a wide range of concentrations (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). The nAb did not, however, affect the availability of FGF1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>), a closely related member of the FGF family. When tested in vitro, we found that FGF2 neutralization blocked FGF2-induced stimulation of NPC proliferation without affecting proliferation in FGF2-free conditions (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). These findings suggest that the nAb blocks FGF2 signaling specifically and does not have nonspecific toxic effects on NPC growth. We then pretreated ACM from EtOH- or CORT-treated astrocytes with FGF2 nAb before exposing NPCs to the treated media. Pretreatment with the FGF2 nAb blocked the CORT-ACM induced increase in NPC proliferation (30.67 \u00b1 3.44% BrdU positive in EtOH, no nAb vs 30.33 \u00b1 2.59% BrdU positive in 1 \u03bcM CORT with nAb; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>), suggesting that increased astrocytic FGF2 is the driving signal for CORT-ACM-induced proliferation of adult hippocampal NPCs."

However, newborn neurons in the adult rat require two or more weeks to mature and become physiologically active (<a href=\"#bib51\">Snyder et al., 2009</a>), implying that the enhancement in neurogenesis we observed following acute stress should require several weeks to influence behavior. We therefore assessed hippocampal memory using a fear conditioning task either 2 days or 2 weeks after acute stress. Immobilized and control rats were given 10 unsignaled, 1 s, 1 mA shocks in a fear conditioning chamber. The next day, they received five 10 min extinction trials where they were exposed to the fear conditioning chamber without shock. On the third day of testing, they received a single 10 min extinction probe trial without shock. When rats were tested 2 days after immobilization, control and immobilized rats showed similar freezing behavior during training, extinction and the 24 hr extinction probe (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013C</a>). When rats were tested 2 weeks after immobilization, immobilized rats did not differ from controls in percent time freezing during training or during the five extinction trials (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D,E</a>). During the extinction probe, however, immobilized rats froze significantly less than control rats, indicating better retention of the fear extinction (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10F</a>). These results suggest that an incubation time is necessary for acute immobilization to improve fear memory and demonstrate enhanced hippocampal memory at a time when newborn neurons are highly plastic and sensitive to environmental input."

This increase in proliferation is correlated with selective activation of the hyper-plastic newborn neurons and enhanced retention of fear extinction 2 weeks after the stressor. Taken together, these findings suggest a beneficial role for acute stress on hippocampal plasticity. Consistent with our findings, previous studies using similar stress paradigms show stress-induced enhancements in memory consolidation and growth factor expression (<a href=\"#bib47\">Roozendaal et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Molteni et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Roozendaal et al., 2009b</a>). Acute stress may also support hippocampal LTP, another factor implicated in stimulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Korz and Frey, 2005</a>). Notably, other manipulations that increase stress hormone secretion, such as exercise, sexual experience and mild immune challenge, similarly stimulate adult neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kronenberg et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wolf et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Leuner et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Buwalda et al., 2012</a>). Recent work in adult squirrel monkeys also shows that coping with intermittent social stress through multiple pair separations and new pair formations both stimulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis and improves hippocampal memory (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lyons et al., 2010</a>). These studies, along with our findings, evoke the interesting possibility that acute stress may be beneficial for brain health in general and hippocampal plasticity in particular."

While some initial work suggested that acute stress causes a decrease in NPC proliferation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cameron and Gould, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gould et al., 1997</a>), more recent publications have not replicated these findings (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thomas et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Thomas et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dagyte et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hanson et al., 2011</a>). Notably, while we found that acute CORT enhanced proliferation in well-handled, habituated rats, we did not find any effect of acute CORT on neurogenesis in rats that were not habituated to injection. Our findings therefore demonstrate that factors present before the stressor begins may alter the effect of acute stress, perhaps by changing the susceptibility of controls or stressed animals to manipulation. Not surprisingly, a rich literature exists regarding the role of handling on altering the rodent stress response (<a href=\"#bib27\">Korosi and Baram, 2010</a>). Such experimental differences could explain discrepancies in the literature."

However, if any one of the three components of this stressor protocol are eliminated, deficits are no longer evident (<a href=\"#bib25\">Knox et al., 2012a</a>), suggesting that stressor effects depend on the severity and length of the stressor, perhaps following the inverted U function previously described (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lupien and McEwen, 1997</a>)."

In multiple non-human primate species, for example, mild early life stress can lead to resilience against stress later in life, a phenomenon referred to as stress inoculation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lyons and Parker, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Katz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Parker and Maestripiero, 2011</a>). In contrast, more severe early life stress can have the opposite outcome, increasing stress vulnerability later in adulthood. When combined with our current findings, these studies fit well with the proposed inverted U function for stress effects on brain health (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lupien and McEwen, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Salehi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Luksys and Sandi, 2011</a>). At high, traumatic levels, acute stress may result in maladaptive pathology (e.g., PTSD-like symptoms in the single prolonged stress model). At more moderate levels, though, such as immobilization in well-handled rats, acute stress may actually enhance function. Future research will be needed to more precisely define the limits of stimulating vs detrimental acute stress."

We have recently reported that hippocampal cell proliferation and the activation of the newborn neurons in a fear-conditioning paradigm both depend on BLA neural input (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kirby et al., 2012b</a>). In the current study, we found that while BLA lesion suppressed hippocampal cell proliferation as we have shown before, it did not affect the acute stress-induced increase in neurogenesis. These findings imply that acute stress regulation of neurogenesis may not rely on the same systems-level in vivo circuitry that mediates acute stress regulation of memory consolidation and LTP. In support of this hypothesis, we were able to model CORT-induced NPC proliferation in isolated NPCs. We found that while NPCs did not respond to acute CORT treatment independently in vitro, they did proliferate more in response to conditioned media from CORT-treated primary astrocytes, suggesting a role for secreted factors from local astrocytes in mediating stress effects on NPCs."

Astrocytes express the glucocorticoid receptor, GR, and when they are exposed to high levels of GCs, GC-bound GR translocates to the nucleus and enhances FGF2 gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib43\">Molteni et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gubba et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Unemura et al., 2012</a>). FGF2 is a potent and necessary proliferative factor in adult NPCs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chipperfield et al., 2002</a>). We found that acute stress stimulated FGF2 expression in the dorsal hippocampus and in primary hippocampal astrocytes. We further showed that in the DG and hilus, the enhancement in FGF2 levels following stress is largely restricted to GFAP+ astrocytes. Notably, changes in FGF2 protein levels following acute stress closely paralleled the neurogenic response; that is, FGF2 levels were increased only in stress conditions that also stimulated neurogenesis. Neutralizing the astrocyte-secreted FGF2 prevented enhanced proliferation in cultured NPCs. These findings suggest a novel role for astrocytes in supporting hippocampal plasticity in response to an environmental stressor through secreted FGF2. Further research will be required to fully dissect the molecular mechanisms by which stress induces FGF2 secretion from astrocytes."

Sahay et al. have further shown that prolonging survival of newly-born neurons through targeted knockdown of apoptotic pathways enhances discrimination between similar contexts in a fear conditioning task (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sahay et al., 2011</a>). We found that 2 weeks, but not 2 days, after acute stress, immobilized rats showed enhanced contextual fear extinction retention compared to controls. We also found that immobilized rats had greater activation of newly born neurons in response to fear extinction recall. This time window coincides with the period in which the newborn cells are hyper-plastic and more likely to be recruited to active circuitry (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kee et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Deng et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kirby et al., 2012b</a>).

Briefly, hippocampi were dissected in ice-cold media, chopped and digested using papain from papaya latex extract (Sigma) in HBSS (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. Papain was inactivated using 10% horse serum, cells were centrifuged for 1 min at 350\u00d7<i>g</i> and resuspended in HBSS and triturated by passing through serological and flame-polished pipettes of progressively smaller bores. Cells were then plated in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Axenia BioLogix, Dixon, CA) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen) at a density of 3 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> in T75 flasks. After reaching confluency, flasks were shaken on an orbital shaker at 225 rpm for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then washed 5\u00d7 with warm PBS to remove suspended microglia. Astrocytes were then trypsinized and re-plated in 100 mm dishes. 24 hr after plating, astrocytes were treated with 1 \u00b5M CORT or equivalent volume of EtOH vehicle for 3 hr. ACM was then collected, filtered with a 0.2 \u00b5m sterile filter and stored at \u221220\u00b0C."

Z-stacks of the dentate gyrus and hilus were acquired using confocal microscopy, and used to identify GFAP+ vs GFAP- cells. The dentate gyrus is primarily composed of dentate granule neurons and while almost every cell expressed FGF2, we found very few GFAP+ cells within the DG, as expected. Given the ubiquitous and closely-packed FGF2 immunoreactivity in the DG, we had to measure mean optical density (with background correction) throughout the Z-stack of FGF2 expression in the DG (rather than in individual cells). No effect of stress or CORT injection on DG FGF2 expression was found using this measure."

Given the mixed cell population but ubiquitous presence of FGF2 in GFAP+ cells, we measured integrated optical density of individual FGF2+ cells that were either GFAP+ or GFAP-. We found increased FGF2 signal in GFAP+ but not GFAP- cells in the hilus following both immobilization and 40 mg/kg CORT injection. These findings suggest that the FGF2 increase seen in whole hippocampal lysates by real time quantitative PCR and western blot (Figure 6) are most likely due to astrocytic FGF2 secretion. Moreover, while other cell types in other hippocampal subregions not quantified here could contribute to overall changes in FGF2, the DG and hilus are the regions flanking the neurogenic niche in the subgranular zone, and are therefore the most likely sources of growth factor changes that influence neurogenesis. These data are presented in the Results section following the section describing Figure 6. The relevant methods have also been added to the Materials and methods section where appropriate."

It is also one of the few FGFs known to be predominantly secreted by astrocytes (as opposed to neurons) [2] in the adult CNS. However, FGF1 has been reported to both stimulate NPCs [3] and be secreted from adult CNS astrocytes [4]. Previous work using the FGF2 nAb that we used in the present studies confirm that the nAb does not cross react with bovine or human FGF1 [5\u20137]. To confirm that the nAb does not neutralize rat FGF1, we performed ELISAs with either rat FGF2 or rat FGF1 and compared standard curves of protein dilutions with or without preincubation with the nAb. We found that while FGF2 was significantly neutralized at all concentrations tested, FGF1 availability in the assay was not significantly affected by the nAb. These data are now presented in Figure 9B,C. Given these specificity data and the prominent, nearly exclusive role of FGF2 in adult NPC proliferation, we feel relatively confident that the effects of this FGF2 nAb are specific to FGF2 neutralization in these studies."

To confirm that FGF2 at concentrations in this range were sufficient to stimulate NPC proliferation, we treated adult rat NPCs with 0 and 4 pg/ml rat recombinant FGF2 for 3h, pulsed with BrdU and then fixed the cells 2h later (design in Figure 5A). We found that as little as 4 pg/ml rat rFGF2 increased the percent of BrdU+ NPCs (reported in the text of the results section for Figure 9). These data demonstrate that the levels of FGF2 found in ACM after CORT stimulation are sufficient to enhance NPC proliferation."

Adult NPCs require 2\u20134 weeks to mature and become physiologically active in the adult rat [9]. Therefore, the relevance of an enhancement in proliferation immediately after stress is questionable without some longer-term effects. Since we do not see more new neurons persisting in immobilized rats two weeks after the stressor (Figure 10G,H), it might seem that the effect of acute stress does not have any functional output."

Including behavioral and neuron activation data such as this is a common practice in the adult neurogenesis literature [10\u201312]. We therefore request to keep these data in the manuscript as we feel many researchers in the adult neurogenesis field will find them helpful in interpreting our data and integrating it into their understanding of how both stress and adult neurogenesis relate to memory and hippocampal function. We have added some additional explanation to the Figure 10 results sections to emphasize these points."
