We have developed a Robust Activity Marking (RAM) system that allows for the identification and interrogation of ensembles of neurons. The RAM system provides unprecedented high sensitivity and selectivity through the use of an optimized synthetic activity-regulated promoter that is strongly induced by neuronal activity and a modified Tet-Off system that achieves improved temporal control. Due to its compact design, RAM can be packaged into a single adeno-associated virus (AAV), providing great versatility and ease of use, including application to mice, rats, flies, and potentially many other species. Cre-dependent RAM, CRAM, allows for the study of active ensembles of a specific cell type and anatomical connectivity, further expanding the RAM system\u2019s versatility."

We have developed a Robust Activity Marking (RAM) system that allows for the identification and interrogation of ensembles of neurons. The RAM system provides unprecedented high sensitivity and selectivity through the use of an optimized synthetic activity-regulated promoter that is strongly induced by neuronal activity and a modified Tet-Off system that achieves improved temporal control. Due to its compact design, RAM can be packaged into a single adeno-associated virus (AAV), providing great versatility and ease of use, including application to mice, rats, flies, and potentially many other species. Cre-dependent RAM, CRAM, allows for the study of active ensembles of a specific cell type and anatomical connectivity, further expanding the RAM system\u2019s versatility."

Identifying these ensembles is key to deciphering how the brain represents experiences and stores them in memory. The most commonly used method for doing so at present relies upon a class of genes called immediate early genes (or IEGs for short). Whenever a neuron becomes active, it switches on its IEGs. By genetically modifying animals to use this mechanism to drive the production of protein markers \u2013 such as a fluorescent protein \u2013 it is possible to visualize and control the neurons that become activated in response to a stimulus."

This is useful for identifying those neurons that become active in response to one particular sensory stimulus."

Experience-dependent transcription events thus present a promising way to genetically identify neurons responsible for encoding learned experiences in vivo.

Immediate early genes (IEGs) such as <i>Fos, Arc</i> and <i>Egr1</i> meet these criteria quite well (<a href=\"#bib19\">Guzowski et al., 2001</a>), and their promoters have been used to control the expression of effector genes such as fluorescent proteins and opsins in genetically engineered mouse lines, allowing active ensemble labeling and functional perturbation, respectively (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barth et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Guenthner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Koya et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Reijmers et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Smeyne et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Eguchi and Yamaguchi, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Denny et al., 2014</a>).

Therefore, to address the problem of background labeling, we wanted to develop an IEG-sensitive promoter with an optimized activity-dependent induction profile and incorporate it into a platform with improved temporal control of effector gene expression."

Animals were kept on Dox chow for at least 1 week after viral injection, switched to Dox-free chow 48 hr before CFC, and sacrificed 24 hr after CFC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). First we virally targeted the dentate gyrus (DG) sub-region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>), which is known to express IEGs after CFC (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Each cohort of animals was divided into the following five treatment groups: (1) left unperturbed in the home cage (HC), (2) CFC, (3) exposed to the novel context only without shock (Context Only) and (4) exposed to immediate shocks (Shock Only) and (5) kainic acid-induced seizure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c\u2013d</a>). We quantified the percentage of EGFP+ cells that were RAM+ (labeled with NLS-mKate2) in each treatment group. We found a significant increase in RAM+ cells in both the CFC and Context Only group, compared to the HC animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Importantly, RAM labeled a very similar number of DG neurons in animals exposed to Context Only as in those that underwent CFC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>), which is consistent with published studies showing that the hippocampus forms contextual representations independent of shock delivery (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rudy and O'Reilly, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fanselow, 2000</a>) and that similar levels of IEG induction occur for these two conditions (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ramamoorthi et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, the Shock Only condition did not induce RAM activation at all (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>), suggesting that RAM labeling was specific to neuronal ensembles involved in contextual learning. Interestingly, such learning-specific induction is one of the unique properties of <i>Npas4</i> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ramamoorthi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sun and Lin, 2016</a>). These results suggest that the RAM system labels an active population of cells in an experience-dependent manner. Importantly, mice that were kept on Dox chow throughout CFC treatment showed a complete lack of RAM+ cells in the DG (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013b</a>)."

If RAM specifically labels the neuronal ensemble encoding a particular context, we would expect to see more overlap after repeat exposure to the same context than after subsequent exposure to a new context. Indeed, the percentage overlap between RAM+ and either FOS+ or NPAS4+ granule cells (GCs) was significantly higher in animals re-exposed to the same context A than in those subsequently exposed to the new context B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c\u2013f,h\u2013i</a>). This suggests that RAM accurately labels neurons that are involved in processing specific context information. Additionally, the absolute percentage of RAM+ or IEG+ GCs was in the 2\u20134% range (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h\u2013i</a>), similar to previous results for this brain region following context exposure (<a href=\"#bib15\">Garner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ramirez et al., 2013</a>). These results indicate that the RAM system labels an active neuronal population similar to that identified by traditional IEG staining. Furthermore, the overlap percentage between RAM+ and IEG+ GCs for context A-A exposed animals was either on par with or significantly higher than overlap percentages shown in equivalent experiments from previously published studies. Furthermore, the roughly two-fold increase in overlap percentage between context A\u2212A and context A\u2212B exposed animals is also on par with previously published studies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Denny et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ramirez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Deng et al., 2013</a>).

We injected AAV-RAM-NLS-mKate2 and AAV-Ef1\u03b1-EGFP into the lateral section (LA) of the basolateral amygdala (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013b</a>), which is the main input locus of the amygdala for auditory afferents. We examined RAM labeling in this region in animals subjected to tone-fear conditioning (TFC), a form of cued associative learning known to require the amygdala (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pare and Duvarci, 2012</a>). Each cohort of animals was divided into the following four treatment groups: (1) left unperturbed in the home cage (HC), (2) TFC, (3) exposed to the tone alone without shock (Tone) and (4) received the immediate shock alone and removed from the testing chamber right away (Shock). Compared to HC controls, TFC led to a dramatic increase in the number of RAM+ neurons in the LA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,f</a>). Interestingly, neither Tone nor Shock treatment alone resulted in RAM labeling significantly above the HC level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,f</a>). The relative levels of RAM labeling in LA under each condition were very similar to those of IEG staining reported in published studies (<a href=\"#bib55\">Senn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Liu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Radulovic et al., 1998</a>). Furthermore, long-term synaptic plasticity is known to occur in the LA following TFC to allow the formation of the tone-associated fear memory, while tone or shock alone does not result in long-term behavioral or synaptic changes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rogan et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rogan and LeDoux, 1995</a>). Our result (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,f</a>) therefore suggests that the neuronal ensembles labeled by RAM are likely involved in fear memory formation."

We first sought to confirm that the RAM system works well in GABAergic neurons, which was implied by RAM labeling of neurons in CeA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5g\u2013i</a>), a region comprised of 95% GABAergic neurons. We injected rats with AAV-RAM-NLS-mKate2 and AAV-Ef1\u03b1-EGFP into mPFC and subjected the animals to the IS paradigm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a\u2013b</a>). Indeed, we found that the number of GAD67-labeled GABAergic neurons that were RAM+ was significantly higher in animals subjected to IS than the HC controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c\u2013d</a>). A small fraction of these induced RAM+ GABAergic neurons were parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013d</a>). In mice, CFC treatment resulted in RAM labeling in a substantial number of somatostatin-positive GABAergic neurons in the hilus of the DG (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2a\u2013f</a>). Additionally, using the Cre-dependent FLEX system and luciferase assay, we confirmed that P<sub>RAM</sub> was induced by KCl stimulation in cultured cortical neurons derived from Gad2-Cre mice wherein Cre is expressed exclusively in neurons expressing the GABAergic neuron marker Gad65 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7e\u2013g</a>). These results confirm that the RAM system achieves robust activity-dependent labeling of GABAergic neurons."

Compared to existing methods used to gain access to recently active neuronal ensembles (<a href=\"#bib18\">Guenthner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Reijmers et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Smeyne et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Eguchi and Yamaguchi, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kawashima et al., 2013</a>), the RAM system delivers unprecedented versatility and much improved selectivity. Additionally, the system showcases a novel, informatics-based approach to constructing small synthetic IEG-sensitive promoters. We believe that this approach could be used to generate other small yet highly sensitive promoters that, when combined with the RAM platform, would allow in vivo\u00a0interrogation of specific activity-dependent genetic programs."

RAM achieves exceptionally high selectivity and sensitivity through the use of an optimized activity-dependent promoter with the highest fold induction we have observed among existing small activity-regulated promoters, paired with an improved version of the Tet-Off system. In vivo\u00a0RAM achieved 37-fold and five-fold increases in labeling after CFC, compared to HC controls, in CA3 and DG, respectively. This is significantly greater than the two\u2013three-fold induction achieved using existing technologies (<a href=\"#bib18\">Guenthner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ramirez et al., 2013</a>). The five\u201337-fold induction achieved with the RAM system implies that 80\u201397% of the labeled neurons are truly associated with the specific experience, compared to 50\u201367% with existing technologies, representing a dramatic improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. This improvement alone means that the RAM system can be used in many brain regions and behavioral applications where existing methods will not work."

Based on the robust results we obtained by applying RAM to label ensembles in several brain regions (DG, CA3, amygdala and mPFC) using appropriate behavioral paradigms (CFC, TFC and IS), we anticipate that RAM can be readily used to investigate neuronal ensembles in other brain regions, such as CA1, striatum, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, etc., for a variety of behavioral manipulations in the future."

Enrichment for each 10mer was calculated as the total number of occurrences in the four central bins (i.e. the \u221280 to +80 region) divided by the total number of occurrences in the eight furthest bins on each flank (\u22121000 to \u2212681 and +681 to +1000). The larger flanking regions were used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the fold enrichment at the enhancer center relative to the flanks. The enrichment factor, E, adjusted for the larger size of the flanking bins, was defined as E = 4*C/F, where C is the number of hits in the central bins and F is the number of hits in the flanks. The significance of finding each motif was calculated using a binomial test (in MATLAB) under the null hypothesis that the hits should be equally distributed between the center and flanks. The p-value is given by p=1-CDF\u00a0(4*C, 4*C + F, 0.5), where CDF (n, N, 0.5) is the cumulative distribution function of finding n elements from a binomial distribution with parameters N and 0.5. If there were no hits in either the center bins or the flanks, the p-value was set to 0.5, and the motif was not considered further. The motifs were ranked by their enrichment factors. Motifs that did not have a Bonferroni corrected p-value&lt;0.05 were excluded from further analysis. A full list of 10mers containing the AP-1 consensus site, ranked by their enrichment factors, can be found in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>.

This is the ratio of the relative luciferase values between stimulated and unstimulated conditions and represents the activity-dependence and selectivity of the promoter. A secondary criterion was the absolute expression level after stimulation, which is the absolute luciferase value normalized against an internal control and reflects the absolute transcriptional strength of the promoter. It is possible for a weak promoter to have high fold induction, due to extremely low activity under basal unstimulated conditions, but to only drive transcription modestly, which will limit its ability to drive the expression of an effector gene to sufficient levels to achieve the required effects."

At the 5\u2019-ITR site, the TRE promoter followed by a multiple cloning site (MCS), WPRE and bGH poly(A) signal was inserted as one expression cassette in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction. In the same orientation, the second expression cassette, consisting of P<sub>RAM</sub> driving d2tTA followed by a SV40 poly(A) signal, was inserted downstream of the first cassette and terminated by the 3\u2019-ITR. The two expression cassettes were insulated by incorporation of synthetic poly(A) and RNA polymerase II transcriptional pause signals (both derived from pGL4.11) between the two cassettes. Fluorescent proteins, including tdTomato and mKate2, and the two opsins, Channelrhodopsin (ChR2, a kind gift from Gloria Choi) and Archaerhodopsin (ArchT, a kind gift from Ed Boyden), were inserted into the MCS.

We also generated homemade AAVs using a FuGene6 (Promega) mediated triple plasmid co-transfection method in HEK293t cells. Three days after transfection, cells were harvested and virus was purified using an adapted Iodixanol gradient purification protocol (<a href=\"#bib37\">Matsui et al., 2012</a>).

For a subset of luciferase experiments, we produced AAV viruses (mixed AAV2/8 serotype) of pAAV-TK-FLEX-Renilla-WPRE-pA (7.36E12 vg/mL) and pAAV-RAM-FLEX-luc2p-WPRE-pA (5.13E12 vg/mL).

Twenty-four hours later, the mice were divided into two cohorts and were either re-exposed to the initial conditioning context, or exposed to a novel context, and were then sacrificed 1.5 hr later. Alternating 50\u00a0\u00b5m brain slices were stained for NPAS4 or FOS. Coronal sections were imaged using an Olympus Fluoview\u00a0FV1000 confocal microscope with a 60X oil objective and Fluoview imaging software. Images were only taken in regions of maximum viral infectivity as mentioned previously. For each animal (n = 4\u20135 per condition), 7\u201310 images were taken of the granule cell (GC) layer of the dorsal dentate gyrus, focusing on the apex of stratum granulosum. Each image was acquired as a Z-stack 20\u201335 \u00b5m thick, with a step size of 2.5 \u00b5m (slice thickness = 0.884 \u00b5m). After acquisition, RAM+, IEG+ and RAM+/IEG+ cells were confirmed to be DAPI positive and were manually counted for each stack in Fluoview. Overlap was defined as the percentage of RAM+ cells that were also IEG+. We estimated the total number of GCs per image as follows. High-resolution cubes (n = 18) of 35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 10 \u00b5m were imaged in the DAPI channel with a 1 \u00b5m step size. We estimated the diameter of each DAPI labeled GC nuclei to be 7.5 \u00b5m. For the entire cube, DAPI cells were counted, excluding those touching 3 of the 6 image faces, and the count was divided by the total cube volume to get a GC density estimate. Our overall GC density was calculated to be 1.35 \u00b1 0.06 cells/1000 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>, slightly higher than previously published estimates (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deng et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kempermann et al., 1998</a>). For each slice, total DG granule cell layer area was measured in Fluoview and multiplied by the stack thickness to get a GC volume.

A short sequence coding for a poly-glycine run was placed downstream of the second FRT site and arranged so that it was in the same reading frame as the ATG start codon, regardless of which FRT site remained after site-specific recombination. The luciferase-coding region (minus its normal ATG start codon) was placed downstream and in frame with the poly-glycine run. In the absence of the flippase (FLP), the transgene would produce no luciferase protein. After FLP-mediated recombination, a fusion protein would be expressed that contains amino acids from the FRT sequence and a poly-glycine run, all fused to luciferase. Reporter constructs were inserted at the NotI/XhoI sites of pCaSper5. Standard methods were used to generate transgenic flies (BestGene). The specificity of the RAM-luc to Flp recombinase was tested using a UAS-Gal4 system, in which Flp recombinase expression is under the control of a heat-shock (hs) promoter (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e\u2013f</a>)."

This looks to be superior to previous methods and so represents an important advance. I was surprised that there is a relatively small difference in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> between A-A and A-B. This may make people worry that it is not really identifying behaviorally linked networks. I wonder why the authors did not look at CA1 neurons in a place field paradigm where the percentage of active neurons and network specificity is well established. Might the threshold activity required to induce the system be relatively high compared to Arc for example. If so, this should be mentioned in the manuscript. The strategy to confer Cre dependence presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> is very nice. Did you ever see expression in parvalbumin neurons? Comment?"

The authors provide two such examples: incorporating P<sub>RAM</sub> with a destabilized tTA in a tet-off system into a single AAV vector that can be used in vertebrate brains and using P<sub>RAM</sub> to drive reporter expression in a Gal4 and Flp dependent manner in <i>D. melanogaster</i>. I think this system is likely to be widely used, and I am supportive of publication in <i>eLife</i>. In general the experiments are elegantly designed and executed, but I have a few concerns relating to the sensitivity and specificity of labeling of active neurons."

These may well be true, but it would nice to know how sensitive their system is in terms of detecting changes in neuronal activation. For example, what is the minimal percent increase in firing from baseline that is reliably reported by P<sub>RAM</sub> ? A measure of sensitivity would also provide estimates of how much noisy fluctuations in firing will elicit P<sub>RAM</sub> driven transcriptional activity. At the very least this should be discussed. The authors could also potentially test this in their primary neuronal cultures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), ideally with channelrhodopsin mediated control of firing. Alternatively, rather than just testing P<sub>RAM</sub> activity with 35mM KCl for 6 hours, a time course (say 2 and 4 hours) and a dose response to KCl would be informative. In these studies, it would be valuable to perform immunolabeling for c-Fos in parallel to compare this new approach to one that is familiar to most neuroscientists."

However, there is some ambiguity here because in the rat model, the dox was excluded and low background was apparently maintained. The use of dox appears to be important for the use of this tool, but the necessity of this component needs to be more explicitly expanded upon so that a future user is well-positioned to understand its importance. In addition, further explanation is required for the modest colocalization of Fos (note Fos, not c-Fos, is the MGI protein abbreviation) with mKate2 in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> for the A-A conditions (only about 20%). Although this colocalization is significantly greater than the context A-B, there is no explanation why the colocalization is not higher. Because the expectation is that expression off of this promoter reflects IEG expression in neurons, this discrepancy is especially concerning as it is an essential aspect for application of this tool. Further examination or explanation of this issue is required."

Since the behavioral manipulations involved vary considerably, the IEGs used for these experiments are not the same, and the quantification methods and statistical analyses also vary significantly, it is extremely difficult to directly compare numbers between studies. Nevertheless, we tried our best to compare our data to studies done in dentate gyrus using contextual fear conditioning. We found our results to be either comparable to or even more impressive than published studies. For example, a study from the Gage lab (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> in Deng et al. <i>eLife</i> 2013;2:e00312) reported a ~6% overlap between Fos reporter (Fos-tTA::<i>tetO-tau-lacZ:tTA*</i>) positive and Fos+ neurons for A-A exposure. Another study from Dr. Rene Hen\u2019s lab (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> in Denny et al. Neuron 83, 2014) showed a 5% or 4% overlap between the Arc-CreER reporter positive neurons and Fos+ or Arc+ neurons for A-A exposure, respectively. While the Gage study didn\u2019t detect a difference in overlapping population between A-A and A-B, the Hen study showed a significant difference between A-A (~4%) and A-B (~2%) conditions. Our data are perhaps best aligned with the study from the Tonegawa lab (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> in Ramirez et al. Science 341, 2013), in which they reported, using a very different quantification method, ~1.8% vs. ~0.9% DAPI+ cells being doubly labeled by the Fos-tTA reporter and Fos antibody under A-A vs. A-B conditions. Assuming the Fos-tTA reporter labeled ~6% neurons following CFC (based on another study from the Tonegawa lab, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> in Liu et al. Nature 484, 2012), for the Ramirez study we can estimate that ~30% and 15% of cells labeled by Fos-tTA were also Fos+ for A-A and A-B conditions respectively. This is comparable to our study. Critically, although the overall number of overlapping neurons varied wildly between studies, the trend is a roughly 2-fold increase in overlap between A-A and A-B conditions. In this respect, our data falls in line with the published literature. We have emphasized this point in the revised manuscript."

However, there is some ambiguity here because in the rat model, the dox was excluded and low background was apparently maintained. The use of dox appears to be important for the use of this tool, but the necessity of this component needs to be more explicitly expanded upon so that a future user is well-positioned to understand its importance. In addition, further explanation is required for the modest colocalization of Fos (note Fos, not c-Fos, is the MGI protein abbreviation) with mKate2 in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> for the A-A conditions (only about 20%). Although this colocalization is significantly greater than the context A-B, there is no explanation why the colocalization is not higher. Because the expectation is that expression off of this promoter reflects IEG expression in neurons, this discrepancy is especially concerning as it is an essential aspect for application of this tool. Further examination or explanation of this issue is required.</i> "

Although not included in the initial submission, we have also used Dox to control RAM expression in the rat, which yielded much more impressive labeling specificity.
