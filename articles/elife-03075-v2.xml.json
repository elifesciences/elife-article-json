These \u2018head direction\u2019 cells are largely confined to a closely-connected network of sites. We describe, for the first time, a population of head direction cells in nucleus reuniens of the thalamus in the freely-moving rat. This novel subcortical head direction signal potentially modulates the hippocampal CA fields directly and, thus, informs spatial processing and memory."

These \u2018head direction\u2019 cells are largely confined to a closely-connected network of sites. We describe, for the first time, a population of head direction cells in nucleus reuniens of the thalamus in the freely-moving rat. This novel subcortical head direction signal potentially modulates the hippocampal CA fields directly and, thus, informs spatial processing and memory."

Its functions are not well-understood, but it has been suggested that, via these connections, NRe influences memory consolidation for spatial learning and generalisation of fear conditioning (<a href=\"#bib5\">Eleore et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Loureiro et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Xu and Sudhof, 2013</a>). To elucidate its functions open-field single-unit recordings in NRe of freely-moving rats were made (<a href=\"#bib9\">Mink et al., 1983</a>). We have found an unexpected population of NRe cells signalling head direction (HD) in the horizontal plane, independent of location within the test arena. These cells resemble HD cells in the anterodorsal and anteroventral thalamic nuclei (<a href=\"#bib12\">Shinder and Taube, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Tsanov et al., 2011</a>), the lateral mammillary nucleus (<a href=\"#bib16\">Taube, 2007</a>), and certain parahippocampal regions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cassel et al., 2013</a>). NRe cells maintain head directionality during light\u2013dark transitions, and in environments of different shape. These cells establish directionality rapidly upon first entering an environment. NRe has not, to date, been part of the traditional HD circuit, which largely originates in the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden and the lateral mammillary nucleus (<a href=\"#bib16\">Taube, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cassel et al., 2013</a>). Subsequent processing is via the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, dorsal presubiculum, entorhinal cortex and to the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib14\">Su and Bentivoglio, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Vertes et al., 2007</a>). Our findings, therefore, reveal a novel head direction signal potentially modulating the hippocampal CA fields and, therefore, hippocampal spatial processing (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brandon et al., 2013</a>)."

The HD cells in NRe share many characteristics of other HD cells, such as those in the anterodorsal and anteroventral thalamic nuclei, the dorsal presubiculum and retrosplenial cortex (<a href=\"#bib16\">Taube, 2007</a>). Current theoretical models of HD information suggest that the HD signal derives, in part, from the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden and the lateral mammillary nuclei (<a href=\"#bib16\">Taube, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cassel et al., 2013</a>). In addition to projecting to the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, the lateral mammillary nucleus innervates NRe (<a href=\"#bib8\">McKenna and Vertes, 2004</a>). NRe also receives inputs from presubiculum (postsubiculum) and retrosplenial cortex, other sites containing HD cells. This pattern of connectivity suggests various potential sources for the heading information found in NRe. The presence of spatial cells in NRe is highly significant, as it is the major source of direct thalamic projections to the CA fields of the rat hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib14\">Su and Bentivoglio, 1990</a>). NRe also receives widespread cortical and limbic inputs, involving both interoceptive and exteroceptive information. This nucleus has a notable role linking medial prefrontal cortex with the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib11\">Prasad and Chudasama, 2013</a>). These NRe HD cells are, therefore, pivotally positioned to influence hippocampal spatial processing directly because of its dense, direct connections with both the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib19\">Vertes, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Prasad and Chudasama, 2013</a>). Finally, the theta-skipping cells may provide a pace-maker like function for synchronising some early components of the HD system."

Briefly, rats were implanted with tetrodes of either four or eight bundles of \u00f8 25 \u00b5m platinum\u2013iridium wires (California Fine Wire Ltd., USA) mounted onto small driveable microdrives (Axona Ltd., UK) at the following coordinates targeted at the nucleus reuniens (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> for histological verification): \u22121.60 mm posterior to bregma, \u22121.20 mm lateral to the midline and at angle of about 5.5\u00b0. Depth varied depending on the target structure and ranged from 4.8 to 5.6 mm below the brain surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Paxinos and Watson, 2005</a>). Rats were allowed at least 1 week of recovery post-surgery. Tetrodes were lowered slowly through the brain (maximal rates 25\u201350 \u00b5m/day), typically over a period of weeks to prevent tissue damage and to ensure successful NRe electrode targeting and penetration. Based on the daily record of the electrode position and post-mortem histological verification, each recording could be located along the tetrode trace. The recording sessions took place in arenas located in the centre of the test room, which contained multiple, large visual cues made salient to allow the animals to orient themselves in the environment.

Furthermore, units had to demonstrate a clean refractory period (&gt;2 ms) in the inter-spike interval (ISI) histogram. Units were sorted using conventional cluster-cutting techniques and classified by the environmental manipulation to which they were exposed. Once well-defined neuronal signals were isolated and the rats explored the arena sufficiently (rats had to explore at least 90% of the open field in either session to be included in analysis to allow reliable calculation of spatial characteristics), recording commenced."

After post-mortem histological verification, 483 cells were assigned to NRe. To select animals for analysis we set following criteria: histologically-verified electrodes should be placed in the lateral part of nucleus reuniens, therefore bypassing laterally the Rhomboid nucleus, avoiding the possibility that by mistake some cells would be wrongly assigned to NRe or the Rhomboid nucleus. Further, an observed electrophysiological criterion required co-localised HD cells and theta skipping cells in NRe. We did recordings in many animals in surrounding nuclei but as described in the present paper theta skipping cells are characteristic only for NRe, are electrophysiologically colocalised with HD cells therefore can serve as an electrophysiological marker of lateral part of NRe. Electrode tracks were localised predominantly in the lateral portion of NRe. The numbers and percentages of cells recorded in NRe were: 42 HD cells (8.7%); 19 theta cycle skipping cells (3.9%; these cells characteristically appeared in NRe, electrophysiologically co-localised with HD cells); 55 other theta modulated cells (11.3%); 23 fast firing cells (4.7%); 21 weakly-theta modulated cells (4.3%); 13 other spatially-tuned cells (2.2%). 309 cells (63.9%) were classified as unidentified low firing units\u2013cells that did not exhibit any particular temporal or spatial properties or formed groups smaller than four cells with similar phenotype.

The rat's HD was calculated for each tracker sample from the projection of the relative position of the LEDs onto the horizontal plane. The directional tuning function for each cell was obtained by plotting the firing rate as a function of the rat's directional heading, divided into bins of 5\u00b0. The firing rate was computed based on the total number of spikes divided by the total time in that bin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Taube et al., 1990</a>). To restrict the influence of inhomogeneous sampling on directional tuning, we accepted data only if all directional bins were sampled by the rat. The directionality of the HD units in the horizontal plane (measured in degrees) was normalized for comparison of the HD firing rate properties. The peak firing rate of cells that respond to different direction of heading was aligned to a HD of 180\u00b0 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bassett et al., 2005</a>). The firing rate was normalized (with values between 0 and 1) with respect to the peak firing rate for each unit (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bassett et al., 2005</a>). The firing rate is calculated by dividing the number of spikes by the number of visits at a particular head direction bin. The CW/CCW separation was calculated by considering a particular angular head velocity threshold (120\u00b0/s). When the rat moves at +120\u00b0/s, it was placed into the CW head direction category (similarly, for CCW, \u2212120\u00b0/s). If it coincidentally happens that spikes occur at a lower rate during slower head movements, the visit count will increase in the non-separating case, the spike count will be relatively decreased (causing a decrease in the firing rate compared to the CW/CCW separation)."

Average frequency is the total number of spikes divided by the total recording time and is expressed in Hz. Where recordings were conducted on successive days, units were matched based on their spike amplitude, height, and spike duration with the respective units from the control recording.

We did not find any negative TSs (as can be seen in the raw autocorrelograms; see supplementary figures).

A jump factor &gt;0.5 means the contribution of the slow varying interfering oscillation in the jump is greater than the theta-range oscillation. If the frequency ratio follows a 2:1 ratio (or closer), then the mathematical basis of using two cosine functions of different frequency ranges to obtain consecutive in-phase or anti-phase superposition to yield lower and higher peaks respectively, is verified."

The electrodes often caused tissue distortion and this was carefully allowed for in the position calculations. Positions of recorded cells were estimated as follows: theoretical positions of electrodes tips and NRe borderlines were estimated by reference to atlas (<a href=\"#bib10\">Paxinos and Watson, 2005</a>) and reconstructed histological specimens. The electrodes sometimes caused tissue distortion even with very slow penetrations, and this was allowed for in the position calculations. The position of electrodes below brain surface was known for each recording session and expressed in \u00b5m, thereby allowing estimates of each cell position to be derived."

Their conclusion is that, because this thalamic nucleus is in a strategic position between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus, these HD cells might provide the hippocampus with directional information that orients the hippocampal map. This is therefore an original and important finding. The paper is concise and provides most of the information required to understand and interpret the main results. It is clearly accessible and should be of interest to researchers studying the neural circuits of spatial information processing."

Each individual circle in the outer ring of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> shows the firing intensity map at the corresponding head direction. If the cell is HDxPlace, then the firing intensity map would/should show focused activity at particular directions that would vary systematically, instead of showing distributed activity (Cho and Sharp 2001, Sharp 1996). As the cell fires only in a range of directions, the firing map shows the activity in the entire arena/or most of it only at that direction range. Other places remain mostly inactive, and thus we conclude that these cells are almost purely HD cells. Furthermore these cells do not form place fields in the standard analysis \u2013 as described in the Methods section. We have checked Cacucci et al., 2004, J Neurosci, <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/38/8265.full.pdf\">http://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/38/8265.full.pdf</a>); they used the same analysis but their results appear to differ to ours - there is constant place representation.
