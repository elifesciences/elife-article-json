However, neither the extent to which this occurs, nor the mechanisms involved are known. Here we investigate DNA methylation variation in Swedish <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> accessions grown at two different temperatures. Environmental effects were limited to transposons, where CHH methylation was found to increase with temperature. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed that the extensive CHH methylation variation was strongly associated with genetic variants in both <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i>, including a major <i>trans</i>-association close to the DNA methyltransferase CMT2. Unlike CHH methylation, CpG gene body methylation (GBM) was not affected by growth temperature, but was instead correlated with the latitude of origin. Accessions from colder regions had higher levels of GBM for a significant fraction of the genome, and this was associated with increased transcription for the genes affected. GWAS revealed that this effect was largely due to <i>trans</i>-acting loci, many of which showed evidence of local adaptation."

However, neither the extent to which this occurs, nor the mechanisms involved are known. Here we investigate DNA methylation variation in Swedish <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> accessions grown at two different temperatures. Environmental effects were limited to transposons, where CHH methylation was found to increase with temperature. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed that the extensive CHH methylation variation was strongly associated with genetic variants in both <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i>, including a major <i>trans</i>-association close to the DNA methyltransferase CMT2. Unlike CHH methylation, CpG gene body methylation (GBM) was not affected by growth temperature, but was instead correlated with the latitude of origin. Accessions from colder regions had higher levels of GBM for a significant fraction of the genome, and this was associated with increased transcription for the genes affected. GWAS revealed that this effect was largely due to <i>trans</i>-acting loci, many of which showed evidence of local adaptation."

There was a lot of variety in the levels of this DNA methylation in the different plants, and some of it was shown to be associated with variation in a gene that is involved in DNA methylation."

As expected under the assumption that CMT2 is responsible for the massive GWAS peak on chromosome 4, the GWAS peak at this locus remains if we consider only the CMT2-dependent DMRs, but not for DCL3-dependent DMRs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, while CHH methylation varied with temperature at both DCL3- and CMT2-dependent DMRs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), DCL3-dependent DMRs were much more strongly associated with previously identified temperature DMRs (4703 out of 10,138 DCL3-dependent DMRs, or 46%, overlapped temperature-sensitive DMRs, whereas the corresponding numbers for CMT2-dependent DMRs were 2299 out of 33,422, or 7%; Fisher's exact p-value &lt; 2.2e-16), suggesting that much of the temperature variation in CHH methylation is due to components of the RdDM pathway. This result is consistent with previous findings showing that RNA silencing is less active at lower temperatures (<a href=\"#bib31\">Romon et al., 2013</a>)."

Further investigation suggested that it has a deletion or rearrangement in CMT2, as we were unable to map reads between positions 2813 and 4944 (intron 7 to exon 16, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Sanger-sequencing indicates the insertion of a stretch of TC dinucleotide repeats of at least 330 bp. The same deletion appears to be present in three more accessions from northern Sweden (TAA-14, TAA-18, and Gro-3) a situation reminiscent of the homologous CMT1 gene, which seems to be non-functional in most <i>Arabidopsis</i> accessions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Henikoff and Comai, 1998</a>). Although CMT2 null alleles have no obvious phenotype, the gene is highly conserved in plants (with the exception of maize; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zemach et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">West et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "It has recently been suggested that natural variation in CMT2 is associated with adaptation to climate (<a href=\"#bib36\">Shen et al., 2014</a>), although the alleles identified in that study do not overlap with the ones identified here. Given the sensitivity of CHH methylation to growth temperature observed here, we next investigated the correlation between DNA methylation and the climate of origin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hancock et al., 2011</a>). While CHH methylation was moderately correlated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in spring (Pearson's r = 0.38), and CHG showed correlation with aridity (r = 0.35) and the number of frost-free days (Pearson's r = 0.30), by far the strongest signal was a strong positive correlation between CG methylation and latitude (Pearson's r = 0.70), as well as with a number of environmental variables that co-vary with latitude in our sample, such as minimum temperature and daytime length (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). As a result of the strong latitudinal correlation, accessions originating from northern Sweden (minimum temperature below \u221210\u00b0C) had on average 11% higher global CG methylation compared to those from the south (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The correlation appears to be driven by gene body methylation (GBM): as the correlation for CG methylation on transposons was much weaker (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Because the methylation variation observed for genes with average CG methylation below 5% appeared mostly to be noise (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, see also the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section), we classified genes into \u2018unmethylated\u2019 and \u2018having GBM\u2019 using this as a cutoff (5%). We also eliminated genes showing a transposon-like pattern of methylation in which not only CG, but also the CHH and CHG contexts are highly methylated (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zemach et al., 2013</a>). In what follows, we use GBM to refer only to gene body CG methylation for this filtered set. In order to better understand the observed variation in GBM, we examined CG methylation at the single nucleotide resolution within GBM containing genes. Although methylation was detectable (using a cut-off of 1%) at a similar number of sites in the north and south (1085292 vs 1079443 CG sites), those in the north showed a distinct skew towards higher methylation levels (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Likewise when the difference between average methylation levels in the north and south was calculated individually for each of the cytosines, the majority of cytosines showed a small increase in the north compared to the south (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). From this we concluded that there is a general small increase in methylation of most CG dinucleotides in GBM genes, rather than large changes in a specific subset. GBM primarily occurs on long, evolutionary conserved genes that tend to be moderately-to-highly expressed, and is positively correlated with gene expression (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zilberman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Takuno and Gaut, 2012</a>). Genes with higher GBM tended to be more highly expressed in our data as well, and\u2014more interestingly\u2014accessions with higher average GBM showed slightly higher average expression of methylated genes (although the correlation was weak, <a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Given that northern accessions had higher GBM, this meant that genes with GBM were on average more highly expressed in northern than in southern accessions, while unmethylated genes showed little difference (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). GBM has previously been shown to be anti-correlated with temperature-dependent gene expression (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kumar and Wigge, 2010</a>). While no large-scale north-south expression differences were observed between 10\u00b0C and 16\u00b0C in our data, northern accessions showed considerably less variation in expression between the two temperatures for genes with GBM (Wilcoxon p-value = 1.2e-05), while no such difference was observed for genes without it (<a href=\"#fig6s6\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 6</a>)."

The results were dramatically different: relative to CHH methylation, the <i>trans</i> effects for GBM are massive, and the environment appears to have no effect (in agreement with the observation that only CHH methylation levels vary with temperature, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To identify the genes responsible, we also performed GWAS for each gene with GBM (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). A total of 3241 significant associations were found for 2315 genes. 43% of these genes had a significant <i>cis</i>-association (within 100 kb of the gene of interest), which could represent local variants affecting methylation directly, or indirectly by affecting gene expression (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gutierrez-Arcelus et al., 2013</a>). No evidence for major <i>trans</i>-acting loci like <i>CMT2</i> was found, but 69% of all significant associations were in <i>trans</i>. A comparison of the direction of the effect of GBM-associated SNPs in <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> revealed a striking pattern (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). While the non-reference alleles of <i>cis</i>-SNPs were 1.18 times more likely to be associated with decreased rather than increased GBM (p = 2.01e-04), the non-reference alleles of <i>trans</i>-SNPs were 3.48 times more likely to be associated with increased GBM (p = 2.2e-16), and the non-reference alleles at the 15 <i>trans</i>-SNPs that were associated with GBM at five or more genes were always positively correlated (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Furthermore, while <i>cis</i>-SNPs showed a wide distribution of allele frequencies similar to random SNPs, <i>trans</i>-SNPs showed a much more limited distribution of frequencies (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) and were also much more strongly correlated with latitude (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). The correlation between GBM and latitude thus appears mostly to be due to <i>trans</i>-acting SNPs."

The candidate regions show an overrepresentation of genes involved in transcriptional processes. We also found that CHH methylation of TEs is temperature sensitive, and identified a major <i>trans</i>-acting controller, <i>CMT2</i>. Taken together, these observations suggest that local adaptation in <i>A. thaliana</i> involves genome-wide changes in fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation, perhaps as a form of temperature compensation."

Two different sources of variants were used: (1) single nucleotide variants (SNV) and structural variants (SV) from genome sequencing (2.1) and (2) SNVs and SVs called in an initial alignment round of the RNA-Seq reads to the TAIR10 reference genome with PALMapper (relevant parameters: -M 4 -G 4 -E 6 -I 25000 -NI 1 -S). For both sources of variants we applied stringent filter criteria to reduce false calls: (1) genome variants had to appear in at least 40 strains with a minor allele count of at least 5 strains, (2) RNA-Seq variants had to be confirmed by at least 2 alignments within the same strain and had to have less than factor 2 many non-confirming alignments within the same strain. Variants from both sources were integrated into one file that was used for a second, variant-aware alignment round with PALMapper (relevant parameters: -M 2 -G 0 -E 2 -I 5000 -NI 0 -S). In variant-aware alignment mode, PALMapper builds an implicit representation of the reference genome that reflects all possible variant combinations that exist for a genomic region. The output is automatically projected to the TAIR10 coordinate system. To account for reads ambiguously mapping to multiple locations in the genome, we used a custom python script (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>) to remove all reads that showed at least one mapping additional to the best hit with the same edit distance. Additional hits were only counted as ambiguous, if they differed at least 3 nt in start and stop coordinates to the best hit. On average, 5.7 M reads were mapped per sample after removal of ambiguous reads. Low complexity libraries with less than 30% of mappable reads or samples with less than 800,000 mappable reads (6 in total) where excluded from further analysis."

In other data, the variation in GBM between north and south is associated with differences in the level as well as variance of expression and is also strongly correlated with climate. It maps to loci that have previously been shown to be involved in local adaptation to climate. To strengthen this further, we have added an FstQst analysis that demonstrates that the trait is under divergent selection. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved will have to await the cloning and characterization of the transacting loci affecting GBM."

That said, natural variation in chromatin compaction clearly does exist, at least in the Cvi accession (Tessodori, 2009) and we have mentioned the possibility. Future studies should investigate this."

Furthermore, several investigations have shown that CG gene body methylation is very highly conserved between different organs (root, shoot, rosette, cauline leaf etc\u037e ColemanDerr &amp; Zilberman, 2012\u037e Seymore DK, 2014). Given that our samples were all rosettes sampled at the same developmental stage, cell type should have very little if any affect on GBM. We have expanded our analysis to demonstrate that roughly the same number of CG sites are methylated in north and south, with the difference being a skew towards higher values in the north (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 4</a>)."

It is certainly correct that we have no evidence that DNA methylation is somehow important for adaptation independent of genetic variation, and indeed we show that it has a strong genetic basis. However, it is wrong to say that there is no evidence for selection. The variants affecting GBM are strongly overrepresented in sweep regions, and show precisely the kinds of climate associations that would be expected if they were involved in local adaption. Furthermore, the northsouth divergence in GBM is far too great to be due to genetic drift (we have added an FstQst analysis to make this clearer). Of course the evidence is all indirect, and of course all these analyses come with significant caveats, but this is usually the case in population genetics. Generating direct evidence of fitness differences is extremely difficult and time consuming."
