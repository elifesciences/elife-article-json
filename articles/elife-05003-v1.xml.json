We combined transcriptomics and systematic imaging to determine the tissue-specific expression and subcellular distribution of 5862 mRNAs during <i>Drosophila</i> oogenesis. mRNA localization is widespread in the ovary and detectable in all of its cell types\u2014the somatic epithelial, the nurse cells, and the oocyte. Genes defined by a common RNA localization share distinct gene features and differ in expression level, 3\u2032UTR length and sequence conservation from unlocalized mRNAs. Comparison of mRNA localizations in different contexts revealed that localization of individual mRNAs changes over time in the oocyte and between ovarian and embryonic cell types. This genome scale image-based resource (Dresden Ovary Table, DOT, <a href=\"http://tomancak-srv1.mpi-cbg.de/DOT/main.html\">http://tomancak-srv1.mpi-cbg.de/DOT/main.html</a>) enables the transition from mechanistic dissection of singular mRNA localization events towards global understanding of how mRNAs transcribed in the nucleus distribute in cells."

We combined transcriptomics and systematic imaging to determine the tissue-specific expression and subcellular distribution of 5862 mRNAs during <i>Drosophila</i> oogenesis. mRNA localization is widespread in the ovary and detectable in all of its cell types\u2014the somatic epithelial, the nurse cells, and the oocyte. Genes defined by a common RNA localization share distinct gene features and differ in expression level, 3\u2032UTR length and sequence conservation from unlocalized mRNAs. Comparison of mRNA localizations in different contexts revealed that localization of individual mRNAs changes over time in the oocyte and between ovarian and embryonic cell types. This genome scale image-based resource (Dresden Ovary Table, DOT, <a href=\"http://tomancak-srv1.mpi-cbg.de/DOT/main.html\">http://tomancak-srv1.mpi-cbg.de/DOT/main.html</a>) enables the transition from mechanistic dissection of singular mRNA localization events towards global understanding of how mRNAs transcribed in the nucleus distribute in cells."

How a cell distinguishes localized from ubiquitous transcripts and orchestrates transport of many mRNAs remains enigmatic. It is conceivable that each localized mRNA carries its own zipcode sequence that directs it to a specific subcellular location. However, despite wealth of data on co-localized transcripts, computational methods thus far fail to detect such signals in a reliable manner. Alternatively co-packaging of several mRNA species, only one of which carries specific localization signal, has been shown in at least two cases (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lange et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jambor et al., 2011</a>).

Comparing mRNA localizations across the sampled time-points showed that the localization status of the majority of mRNAs changes in the oocyte as oogenesis progresses. These changing localizations are not due to alternative gene expression since the germline cells of the <i>Drosophila</i> ovary show only little transcriptional change. Integrative analysis of ovary localization data together with similar data from embryos (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lecuyer et al., 2007</a>) also revealed that mRNA localizations differ across cell types. Therefore, mRNA localization is widespread in cells and is highly regulated."

The following oogenesis gene sets are shown: ubiquitous, nuclear, cellular, subcellular, no signal, nurse cells perinuclear, oocyte-enriched, oocyte anterior and oocyte posterior and apical in epithelial cells. Genes expressed ubiquitously in the ovary mostly remained ubiquitous in the embryo and were additionally enriched in meso- and endoderm; genes of the cellular gene set are enriched in ectoderm/epidermis cells of the late embryo; subcellular genes were highly expressed in the ectoderm and nervous system of the embryo.

The posterior gene set further showed longer gene structures, longer 5\u2032UTRs, longer exons and introns, a higher number of exons and introns, and a higher intron proportion compared to ubiquitous and anterior mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013H</a>). Consistent with the observation that localized mRNAs are enriched in non-coding portions, the exon proportion was the highest in the ubiquitous gene set (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2I</a>). The high intron proportion of posterior genes is particularly interesting in light of the recent finding that the stable deposition of the exon junction complex, required for posterior <i>oskar</i> mRNA localization, is correlated with long intron-containing genes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ashton-Beaucage et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ghosh et al., 2012</a>).

Transport of known mRNAs towards the anterior and the posterior pole of the oocyte requires an intact microtubule cytoskeleton (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib58\">Steinhauer and Kalderon, 2006</a>). We observed that the localization of all new anterior and posterior candidate mRNAs is lost in colchicine-treated egg-chambers, while ubiquitously distributed mRNAs or RNA foci in the nucleoplasm, that lacks a microtubule cytoskeleton, were unaffected by the colchicine treatment (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 8</a>)."

In these Oskar protein deficient egg-chambers <i>oskar</i> mRNA is initially localized at the posterior pole at stage 9.

By comparing exemplary mRNAs across oogenesis time points (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A'</a>), we observed that after being oocyte-enriched mRNAs could enrich at either anterior (<i>Dok</i>) or posterior pole (<i>ZnT35C</i>), but also de-localize and show ubiquitous distribution (<i>exu</i>).

Also the expression levels across time points were highly correlated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), suggesting that the transcriptome remained constant throughout oogenesis.

Across the entire oogenesis, we also could not detect shortening or lengthening of the 3\u2032UTRs, changes in the number of transcript ends and while 55% of genes were expressed in alternative isoforms, the vast majority (&gt;99%) of genes showed no change in isoform expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013J</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary files 5\u20137</a>). Furthermore, the ubiquitous gene set showed similar transcript diversity as subcellular genes. Therefore, changing expression levels, isoform expression, and alternative polyadenylation cannot explain the changing localization of the majority of mRNAs. The stability of the transcriptome from egg chamber formation until the onset of zygotic transcription also suggests that oogenesis is not dependent on transcriptional changes but rather on post-transcriptional regulation of the expressed transcripts, in particular through mRNA localization."

Given that the transcriptome is rather stable yet individual mRNAs show changing localizations across oogenesis, we next analysed mRNA localizations during this period globally. Within one cell, the oocyte, only few mRNAs are localized at all time points, while the majority of localizations is temporary with intermittent ubiquitous phases (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The oocyte has a highly polarized microtubule cytoskeleton that undergoes dramatic re-polarizations across oogenesis (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib58\">Steinhauer and Kalderon, 2006</a>). All mRNA localizations we observed were at sites that are known to enrich for microtubule plus or minus ends. Microtubule orientation is a hallmark of cell polarity. In order to compare localizations across oogenesis stages, we categorized the localized mRNAs as being in proximity to microtubule minus- or plus- ends (<i>plus and minus category</i> <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, inset). We do not show direct association of all localised mRNAs with microtubules. However, microtubule cytoskeleton is required for RNA localization (<a href=\"#bib58\">Steinhauer and Kalderon, 2006</a>) and the oocyte enriched, anterior and posterior localizations categories correspond to where the microtubule minus and plus ends are enriched (<a href=\"#bib60\">Theurkauf et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Januschke et al., 2006</a>)."

Using the localization dendrogram, we observed several groups: mRNAs that remained in the minus category at all time points, mRNAs that switched from minus category to ubiquitous distribution (this was by far the biggest category), mRNAs that switch from minus to plus category (with and without intermittent ubiquitous distribution) and ubiquitous mRNAs that become localized and affiliated with the plus category. It is noteworthy that such de novo localization of an initially ubiquitous transcript was not observed for the minus category. The dendrogram also revealed that such changes in localization occurred at all time points of oogenesis: mRNAs could switch from minus category to ubiquitous distribution at stage 8, 9 or 10 or enrich in the plus category, that is, adopt posterior localization at stage 9 or 10 of oogenesis.

Indeed, we observed mRNAs that were oocyte enriched and apical in epithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B'</a> <i>Sdc</i>). How general is this phenomenon? Does the majority of mRNAs localize to equivalent sites in different cell types or is it a property of singular mRNAs? To address these questions, we use again the microtubule polarity as a universal proxy of cell polarity that enables comparison of equivalent localization sites across tissues. This allows us to extend the minus and plus categories in ovaries to include data from embryos (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lecuyer et al., 2007</a>). Minus category includes additionally apical sets from embryo and plus category includes pole plasm and basal embryonic enrichment categories (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We do not include pole cell annotations in the plus category since this is not a subcellular localization but rather a cell-specific expression pattern. The posterior pole plasm and anterior embryo categories reflect the polarity of embryonic body axis and do not imply any microtubule-related localization mechanism. It is for instance known that some RNAs become restricted to the posterior pole by selective degradation protection mechanism (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib42\">Lipshitz and Smibert, 2000</a>).

Strikingly, the data also show that with respect to microtubule polarity, only three mRNAs were in each cell type localized to the side where also microtubule minus ends are enriched (<i>Dok, Sdc, CG12006;</i> <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Other types of localization, for example, nuclear RNA enrichment, had similarly minimal overlap across cell types (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

Although they are not by themselves predictive of the localization status of individual mRNAs, it will be interesting to examine these properties in other cellular and developmental contexts.

In contrast to the embryo system (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lecuyer et al., 2007</a>), ovarian cells displayed more homogenous subcellular enrichments. With few exceptions, the candidate mRNAs localized at sites known to be enriched for either microtubule minus or plus ends. Curiously, we observed that the ovarian localized mRNAs themselves are strongly enriched for genes with cytoskeletal functions, as were localized mRNAs in the embryo (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lecuyer et al., 2007</a>). This is particularly interesting in light of a recent model suggesting a self-organizing principle for the polarized cytoskeleton in mouse neurites through localized mRNAs and localized translation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Preitner et al., 2014</a>). A local source of cytoskeletal proteins, for example, in the early oocyte could be beneficial to allow the rapid re-organization and growth of the cytoskeleton at the transition from early to mid-oogenesis. Next to cytoskeletal regulating factors, anterior mRNAs that localize in proximity to the meiotic oocyte nucleus were enriched for terms assigning a cell cycle regulating function. It will be interesting to investigate whether anterior mRNA localization affects meiosis, a process shown to be regulated through translational control (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tadros et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Benoit et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cui et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kronja et al., 2014</a>). Curiously at stage 9 and 10, we also identified mRNAs enriched in the nuclei of the oocyte. These mRNAs could either be nurse cell transcripts imported into the meiotic oocyte nucleus or else the controversial instances of transcription from the meiotic nucleus (<a href=\"#bib50\">Saunders and Cohen, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">C\u00e1ceres and Nilson, 2005</a>)."

Considering that the transcriptome appears stable, we find it surprising that the same mRNA isoforms and thus the same primary sequences show such differential localizations during oogenesis. Such pervasive changes in localization status of mRNAs contradict the model that mRNAs localize through sequence encoded mRNA zipcodes (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib44\">Medioni et al., 2012</a>) and that the general localization machinery is active in all cell types analysed (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bullock and Ish-Horowicz, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jambor et al., 2014</a>). It will therefore be interesting to investigate whether specificity of mRNA localization is based on selective, cell-type-specific mRNA regulation machinery or a zipcode signal that is under specific temporal control. mRNAs can, for example, harbour two consecutively acting localization signals that direct mRNAs sequentially to opposing microtubule ends (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ghosh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jambor et al., 2014</a>). However, how one signal is de-activated and the other activated is yet unknown. Alternatively, only few mRNAs could have a zipcode for their localization and the vast majority would be co-transported with these regulated mRNAs in large transport granules. Finally, it is also conceivable that subcellular mRNAs could be locally trapped by unidentified physical properties of subcellular cytoplasmic domains or that similarly to the early embryo, some localization patterns result from protection from general cytoplasmic degradation (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib42\">Lipshitz and Smibert, 2000</a>). All these mechanisms could be active consecutively or in combination during development, which could result in the observed diversity in mRNA localization."

Our resource enables the transition from deep mechanistic dissection of singular mRNA localization events towards systemic examination of how mRNAs transcribed in the nucleus distribute in cells and how this affects cellular architecture and cell behaviour in development."

Additionally, RNA from 0 to 2 hr embryos was isolated. We used two complementary mRNA sequencing approaches; standard whole mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) and a sequencing method, 3Pseq, that captures specifically the sequence adjacent to the poly(A) tail. Our 3Pseq protocol is similar to the SAPAS method described previously (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fu et al., 2011</a>). In contrast to SAPAS, total mRNA was fragmented chemically, resulting in 200 nucleotide long molecules. cDNA was generated and amplified using a polyT primer terminating with a dinucleotide made of non-T followed by a random base and a 5\u2032 template switch primer; both primers containing Illumina adaptors. This allowed us to capture each expressed polyadenylated mRNA once and thereby precisely quantify expression level (Vineeth Surendranath and Andreas Dahl, personal communication). Of the \u223c50 million (3Pseq) and 100 million (RNAseq) Illumina reads, we mapped 70% (3Pseq) and 90% (RNAseq) to the <i>D. melanogaster</i> release 5.52 genome with Bowtie. Quantification was done using HTSeq (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anders and Huber, 2010</a>). Normalization and differential expression was done using DESeq (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anders and Huber, 2010</a>). Noise thresholds of 70 and 50 counts, for RNAseq and 3Pseq respectively, were derived from observing the distributions of normalized counts. 3\u2032UTR forms were assigned by overlaying annotated Flybase UTR forms with 3Pseq reads lying within 200 nucleotides of the annotated 3\u2032UTR end. Alternate Polyadenylation events were called by calculating the mean-weighted UTR length (<a href=\"#bib63\">Ulitsky et al., 2012</a>), a difference of 200 nucleotides in the mean-weighted lengths corresponding to two biological stages resulted in the gene being considered as undergoing Alternate Polyadenylation."

Experiments showing no detectable FISH signal were classified as \u2018no signal at all stages\u2019, while experiments resulting in a homogeneous signal throughout oogenesis were classified as \u2018ubiquitous signal at all stages\u2019. Gene expression patterns were imaged up to stage 10B of oogenesis after which cuticle deposition prevents probe penetration. Each pattern that did not fall in the above-mentioned classes was imaged at all stages of oogenesis in several individual egg-chambers per time point. We collected 3D images and used custom scripts in FIJI (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a>) to manually select and orient representative 2D images that were uploaded to the Dresden Ovarian-expression Table (DOT) (<a href=\"http://tomancak-srv1.mpi-cbg.de/DOT/main\">http://tomancak-srv1.mpi-cbg.de/DOT/main</a>). The 2D images remain linked to the original image stacks and all the raw stacks that were used to create an exemplary 2D image are available for interactive inspection using a simple image browsing cgi script. Thus, the record of each in situ experiment for a given gene consists of a set of 2D images assigned to a specific oogenesis stage and described using annotation terms selected from the controlled vocabulary.

This and the bioinformatics analysis was a great endeavor and given their imaging expertise, the Tomancak lab is perfectly suited to tackle this project. However, it is not clear whether the authors provided any new insights into the biology of the mRNA localization. Additionally, in some places the authors oversimplify or over interpret the data (see below). Thus, the value of this manuscript beyond its value as a resource is not tangible. After correction of some of the misstated and misleading interpretations, this article could be suited as a \u201cResource\u201d rather than the \u201cArticle\u201d format. Irrespective where this will be published, the following points need to be addressed: 1) What criteria did the authors use to determine the minus and/or plus end microtubule localization? For example, in the subsection headed \u201cChanging mRNA localization during development\u201c, the authors state that 591 mRNAs co-localized with the microtubules minus ends during oogenesis. In the same subsection, they mention that \u201cminus-end accumulation only re-emerged after initiation of transcription\u2026\u201d. How did the authors test this localization with the microtubules? The authors should clearly write whether this type of co-localization was assumed for the mRNAs tested based on previous reports or provide data showing this finding. Would it not be better and less confusing to call the localization as \u201canterior\u201d or \u201cposterior\u201d? It would tell the same story without implying additional mechanisms of localization, which were not tested at all."

This Figure is misinterpreted as the authors neglect the fact that approximately 60% of the maternally-deposited genome is degraded in the embryo while the germ plasm enriched mRNAs are protected from degradation and remain enriched at the posterior. Thus, in this case degradation will affect the statistics in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1D</a> and the conclusion that there is a link between transcription and minus-end localization will not be valid. For example, the localization of Hsp83 mRNA at the posterior pole becomes apparent only after the activation of zygotic genome due to the degradation of un-localized Hsp83 elsewhere in the embryo. Did the authors find Hsp83 as \u201cminus-end\u201d localized in the stage 3\u20135 embryos? There are many mRNAs that localize to the posterior in a manner like Hsp83 and thus for them too this link between the minus end localization and transcription would be invalid. The authors should correct this error. Since the authors cannot account for the changes in mRNA levels due to mRNA degradation in the embryo this Figure is inherently difficult to interpret and should perhaps be removed from the manuscript."

However, instead of interpreting this finding as an indication that Oskar protein and other germ plasm components are required for the posterior localization of these RNAs, the authors interpret this finding that these novel mRNAs hitchhiked with osk mRNA to the posterior or that oskar mRNA could recruit and stabilize minus ends at the posterior thereby enabling localization of these novel mRNAs. It would have been very exciting if the authors had identified another RNA besides osk itself that could hitchhike with osk or identified a new posteriorly localized RNA that directly, and independently of Oskar protein, requires microtubules for its localization. However, apparently none of their RNAs fit this interpretation, as judged by <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, where the authors show that localization of all RNAs tested is affected in <i>osk84/Df</i>, where, as the authors also show, osk RNA is properly localized. More stringent experiments would have been to determine this question in an <i>osk166</i> allele, a missense mutation (rather than the 84 nonsense allele) that affects germ plasm assembly, or other mutations downstream of Oskar that act in the germ plasm assembly pathway (Vasa, Tudor). The most definitive experiment would have been to ask whether these posteriorly localized RNAs localize to the anterior pole in oocytes and embryos expressing osk-bcd3'UTR, since in this case osk RNA localization is clearly separated from its function in germ plasm assembly."

Furthermore, there is to my knowledge no published report that suggests that Oskar has a direct an effect on microtubule polarization. Thus the fact that localization of all RNAs is affected in the oskar RNA and protein null mutants, where microtubule polarity is normal, strongly suggests that these RNAs are not directly localized by microtubule mediated transport. Failure to localize after colcemide treatment is likely a function of loss of oskar localization. It is thus misleading by the authors to interpret the defect in RNA localization after colcemide treatment as evidence for a direct role of microtubules in localization of these RNAs. The authors need to correct this misinterpretation of the data. Additional experiments such as careful analysis of the timing of RNA localization and disruption of the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton at different time points during oogenesis (see Curr Biol. 2003 July 15;13(14):1159-68) would be required to make any conclusions about the mechanisms of localization employed by the described RNAs. As these experiments are likely beyond the scope of the present analysis, the authors should avoid misleading readers."

And the further increase in plus-end localization during embryogenesis does not result from a favoring of plus-end accumulation over minus-end accumulation in the embryo, but rather from the well-documented protection from degradation afforded by the germ plasm."

Since the in situ in the ovaries gave no signal, the gene is entirely eliminated from the comparison of mRNAs across development. mRNA degradation of maternal transcripts occurs in two phases (Bashirullah, LIpshitz, 1999), one in the late oocytes during oocyte activation and a second phase during early embryogenesis at stage 2\u20133. The latter degradation pathway is mediated by SMG and does affect for example Hsp83 mRNA (Semotok, Smibert, 2005). To investigate how the many SMG-bound mRNAs (Chen, 2014) relate to oocyte localized mRNAs is very interesting. Due to the degradation/protection-from-degradation these mRNAs are enriched in the pole cells; this is an asymmetric distribution of the mRNA along the embryo, but not strictly a subcellular localization since the mRNAs is ubiquitous in pole cells and absent from the rest of the embryo.

We would speculate that these RNAs do require factors present in the germ plasm. However, to understand if <i>oskar</i>-RNA mediated localization at stage 9 is direct or indirect the experiment would be difficult to interpret. <i>osk-bcd</i> is expressed as a transgene in the presence of wild-type <i>oskar</i> mRNA. Thus the egg-chambers will have <i>oskar</i> mRNA at both poles. Depending on which portion of the oskar mRNA would mediate the interaction with the candidate mRNAs, they would be recruited to the both poles (motif in the CDS) or just the posterior pole (motif in the UTR, as shown for <i>osk\u2013osk</i> hitchhiking). Finally, genetic evidence suggests that <i>osk</i> mRNA is able to recruit Par1 protein and in <i>osk-bcd</i> egg-chambers indeed Par1 accumulates at both poles of the oocyte (Shulman, 2000). This strongly influences the polarity of the entire egg-chamber and would make interpretation of the results difficult. In fact, a positive feedback loop between oskar mRNA/Oskar, Par1 and microtubule plus ends was previously shown (Zimyanin, 2007). In Btz and Khc mutants that are unable to promote <i>oskar</i> mRNA localization to the posterior pole this leads to a complete loss of posterior Kinesin-beta-Gal. Conversely, ectopic localization of <i>oskar</i> mRNA ultimately results in ectopic accumulation of Par1 and also microtubule plus ends, this was shown by Zimyanin et al., 2007 (Curr Biol. 2007 February 20;17(4):353-9.)."

Only for one mRNA, <i>oskar,</i> the mRNA regions directing opposing microtubule localization is understood in more detail (Ghosh, 2012; Jambor, 2014). To our knowledge, however, there is no study yet showing that mRNAs do change their specific subcellular localizations to the dramatic extent that we observed. In contrast, it is generally believed that mRNAs have cis-regulatory localization signals (zipcodes) that dictate their intracellular transport. Previous studies showed that specifically the cell types compared in this study express the machinery required for mRNA localization and can localize a zipcode-containing reporter to equivalent subcellular sites (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bullock, 2001</a>; Jambor, 2014). Zipcodes are sequences and integral parts of the mRNAs, similar to domains in a protein. Thus once an mRNA is expressed and the machinery is present, the zipcode should be recognized and the mRNA transported. We show that the mRNAs expressed in the oocyte show no sign of transcriptional and isoform variation during oogenesis. It follows that they should have the same motif throughout oogenesis that should promote localization. And yet, this is not the case. We were expecting to find mRNAs localized during oogenesis to show similar localization behavior in embryos. There was no published evidence that changing destinations in the cytoplasm is a global feature of mRNAs. We used the word surprising exactly once in the discussion part of our manuscript. We ask the reviewer whether disagreement on the subjective evaluation of the intuitive appeal of the data is a sound basis for dismissing a product of three years of work that generated large amounts of clearly useful data."
