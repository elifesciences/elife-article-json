The Rabex-5 GEF activity is autoinhibited by the Rabex-5 CC domain (Rabex-5CC) and activated by the Rabaptin-5 C2-1 domain (Rabaptin-5C21) with yet unknown mechanism. We report here the crystal structures of Rabex-5 in complex with the dimeric Rabaptin-5C21 (Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub>) and in complex with Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> and Rab5, along with biophysical and biochemical analyses. We show that Rabex-5CC assumes an amphipathic \u03b1-helix which binds weakly to the substrate-binding site of the GEF domain, leading to weak autoinhibition of the GEF activity. Binding of Rabaptin-5C21 to Rabex-5 displaces Rabex-5CC to yield a largely exposed substrate-binding site, leading to release of the GEF activity. In the ternary complex the substrate-binding site of Rabex-5 is completely exposed to bind and activate Rab5. Our results reveal the molecular mechanism for the regulation of the Rabex-5 GEF activity."

The Rabex-5 GEF activity is autoinhibited by the Rabex-5 CC domain (Rabex-5CC) and activated by the Rabaptin-5 C2-1 domain (Rabaptin-5C21) with yet unknown mechanism. We report here the crystal structures of Rabex-5 in complex with the dimeric Rabaptin-5C21 (Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub>) and in complex with Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> and Rab5, along with biophysical and biochemical analyses. We show that Rabex-5CC assumes an amphipathic \u03b1-helix which binds weakly to the substrate-binding site of the GEF domain, leading to weak autoinhibition of the GEF activity. Binding of Rabaptin-5C21 to Rabex-5 displaces Rabex-5CC to yield a largely exposed substrate-binding site, leading to release of the GEF activity. In the ternary complex the substrate-binding site of Rabex-5 is completely exposed to bind and activate Rab5. Our results reveal the molecular mechanism for the regulation of the Rabex-5 GEF activity."

In this process, small GTPase Rab5 functions as a master regulator of the early endosomal biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib41\">Stenmark, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mizuno-Yamasaki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zeigerer et al., 2012</a>). Rab5 is localized to early endosomal membrane via its isoprenylated C-terminus and regulates early endosomal fusion through interactions with an array of effectors including Rabaptin-5 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stenmark et al., 1995</a>), Rabenosyn-5 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nielsen et al., 2000</a>), EEA1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mills et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Simonsen et al., 1998</a>), PI3Ks (<a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Christoforidis et al., 1999</a>), and APPLs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Miaczynska et al., 2004</a>). Like other small GTPases, Rab5 exists mainly in two states, the GTP-bound active state and the GDP-bound inactive state, and requires guanosine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for activation and GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for inactivation."

The GEF domain is located in the middle and consists of a helical bundle (HB) domain and a Vps9 domain (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Besides, the N-terminal region comprises two distinct ubiquitin-binding domains, a zinc finger domain and a motif interacting with ubiquitin domain, which can interact with ubiquitinated cargoes or adaptors to recruit Rabex-5 to early endosomal membrane (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mattera et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Penengo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mattera and Bonifacino, 2008</a>) and function as an E3 ligase for Ras ubiquitination to promote Ras endosomal localization (<a href=\"#bib48\">Xu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yan et al., 2010</a>). The following membrane binding motif domain and the HB domain together compose an early endosomal targeting domain that can direct Rabex-5 to early endosomal membrane (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhu et al., 2007</a>). The C-terminal region consists of a coiled-coil (CC) domain and a proline rich region; the CC domain is involved in autoinhibition of the GEF activity and binding of Rabaptin-5 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lippe et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mattera et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Delprato and Lambright, 2007</a>). Rabaptin-5 is a key effector of Rab5 and plays an important role in both homotypic and heterotypic fusions of early endosomes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stenmark et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Stenmark, 2009</a>). It is a scaffold protein consisting of primarily four coiled-coil domains, namely C1-1, C1-2, C2-1, and C2-2 domains (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The C2-1 domain is responsible for interaction with and recruitment of Rabex-5 to early endosomal membrane to activate Rab5 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lippe et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mattera et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Delprato and Lambright, 2007</a>). Besides, the N-terminal region can mediate interactions with Rab4 and Rab8 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Vitale et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Omori et al., 2008</a>); the middle region can interact with the GAE and GAT domains of GGAs that function as effectors of the Arf family small GTPases in the tethering and fusion of trans Golgi network (TGN) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mattera et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Miller et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zhu et al., 2004a</a>); and the C-terminal region can interact with the GTP-bound Rab5 that recruits Rabaptin-5 to early endosomal membrane (<a href=\"#bib45\">Vitale et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhu et al., 2004b</a>). In addition, Rabex-5 and Rabaptin-5 have been shown to function as neoplastic tumor suppressors and are implicated in human cancers (<a href=\"#bib23\">Magnusson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Christoforides et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Thomas and Strutt, 2014</a>), and Rabex-5 has also been shown to determine the neurite localization of its substrate Rab proteins and thus plays an important role in the development of hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mori and Fukuda, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mori et al., 2013</a>)."

We were able to obtain Rabex-5 and the Rabex-5-Rabaptin-5C21 (R2) complex with high purity, stability, and homogeneity, but unfortunately failed to grow any crystals for either Rabex-5 or the R2 complex. Partial digestion of the R2 complex with trypsin shows that Rabex-5 could be proteolyzed in the linker between the GEF and CC domains (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that the linker is surface exposed with high flexibility which may prevent proper crystal packing. Thus, we constructed a series of Rabex-5 variants containing different forms of linker deletion (Rabex-5\u0394). Although none could be crystallized alone, one Rabex-5\u0394 variant (residues 132\u2013455\u0394393\u2013407) led to successful crystallization of the Rabex-5\u0394-Rabaptin-5C21 (R2\u0394) complex."

The binding regions for Rab4, Rab5, Rab8, and the GAE and GAT domains of GGAs are indicated. The C-terminal part of the C2-1 domain contains the binding site for Rabex-5. The segments of Rabex-5 and Rabaptin-5 whose structures are determined in this work are indicated with black bars. The color scheme of the domains is adopted in all the Figure in this work unless otherwise specified."

Notably, each Rabaptin-5C21 forms a long \u03b1-helix (about 125 \u00c5) and two Rabaptin-5C21 dimerize in parallel to form a twisted linear two-helix bundle, which is different from the V-shaped conformation in the R2\u0394 complex. Otherwise, two symmetry-related complexes also dimerize through the N-terminal regions of Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub>. Rabex-5CC also forms a long \u03b1-helix (52 \u00c5) and packs in parallel with the C-terminal regions of Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> to form a tight three-helix bundle. The interactions between Rabex-5CC and Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> are essentially the same as those in the R2\u0394 complex. These results confirm that Rabex-5CC assumes a stable amphipathic \u03b1-helix and tends to bury its nonpolar surface via interactions with other proteins; Rabaptin-5C21 may adopt two different conformations and forms a stable homodimer; and the interactions between Rabex-5CC and Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> are conserved in different complexes."

We first measured the in vitro GEF activity of different Rabex-5 variants and mutants. Our kinetic data show that Rabex-5 containing the GEF and CC domains possesses a basal GEF activity (0.93 \u00b1 0.03 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>); the Rabex-5 GEF domain alone exhibits a 3.2-fold higher activity (2.93 \u00b1 0.06 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>); and the R2 complex exhibits a 3.3-fold higher activity (3.07 \u00b1 0.08 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Moreover, the Rabex-5 mutants containing mutations on the nonpolar surface of Rabex-5CC exhibit relatively higher GEF activity (1.4\u20131.9 folds) compared with the wild-type Rabex-5 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These results indicate that the GEF domain itself is constitutively active; the CC domain slightly autoinhibits the GEF activity; and the binding of Rabaptin-5C21 to Rabex-5CC relieves the autoinhibition, which are largely in agreement with the previous biochemical data (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lippe et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Delprato et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Langemeyer et al., 2014</a>). However, the magnitude of the autoinhibition by Rabex-5CC is smaller than that reported by <a href=\"#bib6\">Delprato and Lambright (2007)</a>, which may be caused by differences of the assay systems, for examples, different Rab5 and Rabex-5 constructs, different concentration of the proteins, and different sensitivity of the instruments."

In agreement with the GST pull-down results, our kinetic data show that the GEF activity of the L434D, L438D, and W441A Rabex-5 mutants cannot be activated by Rabaptin-5C21, whereas that of the I439D Rabex-5 mutant can be potentiated by Rabaptin-5C21 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Similarly, the L610D, L613D, and L617D Rabaptin-5C21 mutants cannot relieve the autoinhibition of Rabex-5; whereas the I608D Rabaptin-5C21 mutant can activate the GEF activity of Rabex-5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). It is noteworthy that due to partial aggregation of Rabaptin-5C21, the GEF activity of the mixed R2 complex is only 1.6-fold higher compared with Rabex-5 which is weaker than the co-expressed and co-purified R2 complex (3.3-fold)."

To explore the functional role of this interaction, we constructed two Rabaptin-5C21 mutants containing a quadruple mutation (N568A/E572A/Q579A/E582A) and a double mutation (I608A/D623A) of the residues on the interaction interface and detected their effects on the GEF activity of the R2 complex. Our kinetic data show that the GEF activity of these mutant complexes are unaffected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating that this interaction is not essential for the activation of the Rabex-5 GEF activity. Intriguingly, when the N-terminal half of Rabaptin-5C21 (residues 552\u2013592) was removed, the GEF activity of Rabex-5 could not be activated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating that the full-length Rabaptin-5C21 is required for the function of the R2 complex in the Rab5 activation. Taken together, these data indicate that the structures of the R2\u0394 and R3\u0394 complexes are functionally relevant, and the interaction between Rabex-5 and Rabaptin-5 is important for the activation of the Rabex-5 GEF activity in Rab5 activation, which is in accord with the previous biochemical data (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lippe et al., 2001</a>)."

The GEF activity of Rabex-5 is autoinhibited by its CC domain and is activated by the binding of Rabaptin-5 via its C2-1 domain. However, the molecular mechanism is unknown. In this work, we determined the crystal structures of Rabex-5\u0394 in complex with Rabaptin-5C21 and in complex with Rabaptin-5C21 and Rab5, which are validated by biophysical and biochemical analyses."

Rabex-5CC forms a stable amphipathic \u03b1-helix that tends to bury its nonpolar surface via oligomerization or interaction with the C-terminal regions of Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub>. The nonpolar surface of Rabex-5CC has good chemical and geometrical complementarities with the nonpolar surface groove of the GEF domain and thus might be able to bind there to block the substrate binding and hence autoinhibit the GEF activity as proposed by <a href=\"#bib6\">Delprato and Lambright (2007)</a>. Nonetheless, our structural and biochemical data show that although Rabex-5CC alone exists as a stable helix in both solution and crystal structure, it cannot form a stable complex with the GEF domain as shown by both GST pull-down assay and ITC analysis (data not shown). In addition, Rabex-5 and Rabex-5\u0394 cannot be crystallized alone and Rabex-5 can be easily proteolyzed in the linker region (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results suggest that the CC domain and the linker have high flexibility. Moreover, Rabex-5 itself has a basal GEF activity which is slightly weaker (about 1/3) than that of the constitutively active GEF domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>) but is not so weak compared with some other GEFs including DSS4 (a GEF for Ypt1p) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Esters et al., 2001</a>) and MSS4 (a GEF for Rab8) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Itzen et al., 2006</a>). Mutations of the residues on the nonpolar surface of Rabex-5CC can enhance the GEF activity by 1.4\u20131.9 folds (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These results together indicate that the binding of Rabex5CC to the GEF domain is not tight, and Rabex-5 alone is not completely autoinhibited."

Meanwhile, the GEF domain folds along the three-helix bundle with a partially occupied substrate-binding site, suggesting that further conformational change is required to completely expose the substrate-binding site for Rab5 binding and activation. Indeed, in the structure of the R3\u0394 complex, although Rabex-5CC still forms a tight three-helix bundle with the C-terminal regions of Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub>, Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> forms a linear two-helix bundle which is different from the V-shaped conformation but similar to that in the Rabex-5CC-Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> complex and the GAT-Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> complex (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhu et al., 2004a</a>).

In the free-form Rabex-5, Rabex-5CC may bind weakly via the nonpolar surface to the substrate-binding site of the GEF domain, leading to the blockage of the substrate-binding site and thus a weak autoinhibition of the GEF activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, State I). As the binding of Rabex-5CC to the GEF domain is not tight, it might assume alternative conformations. The linker between the GEF and CC domains might help to modulate the conformational flexibility and/or the relative conformations of the two domains and thus plays a minor role in the autoinhibition. One plausible alternative conformation of Rabex-5CC might be similar to that observed in the R2\u0394 structure with a largely exposed substrate-binding site of the GEF domain. As the interaction of Rabex-5CC with the GEF domain via the nonpolar surface is much tighter than that via the adjacent surface, Rabex-5CC might exist mainly in the autoinhibitory conformational state and partially in the alternative conformational state. This may explain why the free-form Rabex5 exhibits some basal GEF activity. Rabaptin-5C21 might bind to the C-terminal region of the nonpolar surface of Rabex-5CC in the autoinhibitory conformational state and induce conformational change of the \u03b1-helix to transform into the conformational state as observed in the R2\u0394 structure, or directly to the exposed nonpolar surface of Rabex-5CC in the alternative conformational state, leading to the relief of the autoinhibition and the release of the GEF activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, State II)."

As the GAT-binding site is unoccupied, Rabaptin-5 may bind Rabex-5 and GGA1 simultaneously. These results demonstrate that Rabaptin-5C21 always forms a dimer which can assume either a V-shaped or a linear conformation and can bind other proteins via different regions. In addition, the dimeric Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> prefers to further dimerize to form a dimer of dimers via the regions that are not involved in the interactions with other proteins. In the context of full-length Rabaptin-5, it is possible that Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> might exist in either the V-shaped or the linear conformation depending on the functional state. The dimerization of Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> might not only avoid exposure of the hydrophobic surface and minimize the overall energy of the protein in aqueous environment, but also play some functional roles in the tethering and fusion of early endosomes and/or with other vesicles."

The mixture was incubated for 2 hr and the free mantGDP was removed by gel filtration using a HiTrap De-salting column (GE Healthcare). The mantGDP-bound Rab5 was diluted to 500 nM in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Nucleotide exchange reaction was initiated by addition of GTP to a final concentration of 1 mM and varied concentrations (50\u2013500 nM) of Rabex-5 or Rabex-5-Rabaptin-5C21. Dissociation of mantGDP was monitored by measuring the decrease of fluorescence. Samples were excited at 360 nm and the emission was monitored at 440 nm. Fluorescence data were recorded using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Agilent Technologies).

Collectively, these structures represent an important contribution to the field by defining the mode of interaction between the coiled coil regions of Rabex-5 and Rabaptin-5, identifying alternative conformational states and interactions with the substrate site that may have a functional role, and providing an overview of the quaternary organization of the active complex with a substrate Rab. The structural information is complemented by kinetic, binding, and cell morphologic analyses of the constructs used for the crystallographic studies as well as the effects of various site specific mutants. Finally, the authors also investigated whether the alternative conformations are compatible with SAXS experiments in solution."

Previous work from the Zerial lab has demonstrated synergy between Rabex-5 and rabaptin-5. A simple explanation for this would be that rabaptin-5 binding both promotes or stabilizes membrane association of Rabex-5 and stimulates its activity by relieving auto-inhibition. Such a model would fit with the modest activation of core GEF activity seen on rabaptin binding. To test this idea the localization of Rabex-5 point mutants with compromised rabaptin interaction would be informative. This should be done at low expression levels, but is not essential for publication."

The images in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> and Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 3 show Rab5 localization in BHK cells transfected with Rabex-5 constructs in the presence of the endogenous Rabex-5. 2. The experiments in 3G depend upon equal expression of Rab5 as well as the various Rabex constructs introduced and a stable Rab5 cell line would be most appropriate here. In any case, co-staining for the constructs and quantitation of expression levels would add confidence to the findings reported. Quantitations on endosome size are mentioned in the Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 3 legend text but it is not clear how such numbers could be obtained from the data presented here. The staining could be Golgi from the images presented. First, the images don't show any obvious endosome staining and also require another marker. Second, these experiments need to be done in the absence of endogenous Rabex-5. Finally, some form of functional assay for Rab5 dependent endocytic transport should be performed, for example growth factor or transferrin uptake. The best way to fix this would be to rescue cells depleted of Rabex-5 and monitor endocytosis after transfection with various rescue constructs."

Considering that the cotransfection efficiency with three (Rab5, Rabaptin-5, and Rabex-5) or four (+EGFR) plasmids is very low, this method appears to be very hard to work. In addition, for the cell morphological analyses, we have to mark the siRNA with a fluorescence label to monitor its transfection, which inevitably increases the difficulty to distinguish the siRNA signal from the fluorescence signals of the co-transfected proteins.

However, the activation of Rab5 facilitates the ligand-independent EGFR internalization (Dinneen and Ceresa, 2004a). In addition, although Rab5 can accelerate the transferrin internalization, there is no obvious difference between the wild-type and constitutively active mutant (Q79L) Rab5 (Stenmark et al, 1994). Therefore, to analyze whether the activation of Rab5 by the Rabex-5-Rabaptin-5 complex has any effect on the endocytic transport, we have performed both cell biological and biochemical experiments to detect the internalization of the unliganded EGFRs in HEK 293 cells (which do not express native EGFR) co-transfected with EGFR, Rab5, Rabex-5, and Rabaptin-5 (data not shown). Consistent with our cell biological results shown in Figure 5, the new results also showed that Rabex-5 and Rabaptin-5 can enlarge the size of early endosomes and disruption of the Rabex-5-Rabaptin-5 interaction decreases the size of early endosomes accordingly. We also observed that EGFR can colocalize well with Rab5 in each case, suggesting that the endocytic trafficking of EGFR is correlated to the function of Rab5. However, we did not observe notable difference of the EGFR internalization in the cells co-expressing the vectors and different forms of Rabex-5 and Rabaptin-5 in both the cell morphological analysis of the distribution of EGFRs and the biochemical analysis of the surface EGFRs by surface biotinylation assay (Chen et al, 2012). These results suggest that under our assay conditions, the activation of Rab5 by the Rabex-5-Rabaptin-5 complex has little effect on the internalization of EGFR but is essential for the proper function of Rab5 in the downstream processes, such as the fusion of early endosomes. Due to the indirect relevance of these results to the main topic of this paper, we decided not to include these results in the revised text."

In this case, as the GEF activity of Rabex-5 is autoinhibited by Rabex-5CC, Rabex-5 can only activate Rab5 at the basal level. In the cells, most Rabex-5 forms a stable complex with Rabaptin-5 which can be recruited to early endosomes via the binding of Rabaptin-5 through the C-terminal region to GTP-bound Rab5 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lippe et al, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhu et al, 2010</a>).

In addition, it prefers to further dimerize to form a dimer of dimers via the regions that are not involved in the interactions with other proteins. In the previous version of the manuscript, we did not discuss these issues due to space limitation. As suggested by the reviewers, in the revision, we have added a brief discussion on the oligomerization and conformational flexibility of Rabaptin-5 within the context of the full-length protein as follows: \u201cIn the GAT-Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> structure, Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> assumes a linear conformation, the N-terminal regions of Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> bind one GAT, and two symmetry-related Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> dimerize through the C-terminal regions (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhu et al, 2004a</a>) which are the binding site for Rabex-5CC. Interestingly, Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> assumes a linear conformation in the Rabex-5CC-Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> structure but a V-shaped conformation in the R2\u0394 structure, and in both structures, the C-terminal regions of Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> bind one Rabex-5CC and two symmetry-related Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> dimerize through the N-terminal regions which are the binding site for GAT. Moreover, in the R3\u0394 structure, Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> also assumes a linear conformation but two Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> dimerize through the middle regions (residues 590-600) between the GAT-binding site and the Rabex-5CC-binding site. As the GAT-binding site is unoccupied, Rabaptin5 may bind Rabex-5 and GGA1 simultaneously. These results demonstrate that Rabaptin-5C21 always forms a dimer which can assume either a V-shaped or a linear conformation and can bind other proteins via different regions. In addition, the dimeric Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> prefers to further dimerize to form a dimer of dimers via the regions that are not involved in the interactions with other proteins. In the context of full-length Rabaptin-5, it is possible that Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> might exist in either the V-shaped or the linear conformation depending on the functional state. The dimerization of Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> might not only avoid exposure of the hydrophobic surface and minimize the overall energy of the protein in aqueous environment, but also play some functional roles in the tethering and fusion of early endosomes and/or with other vesicles.\u201d"
