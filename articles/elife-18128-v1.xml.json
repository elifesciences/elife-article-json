These cells undergo cell death and replacement (turnover) throughout life in non-mammalian vertebrates. However, there is no definitive evidence that this process occurs in mammals. We used fate-mapping and other methods to demonstrate that utricular type II vestibular hair cells undergo turnover in adult mice under normal conditions. We found that supporting cells phagocytose both type I and II hair cells. <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></i>-expressing supporting cells replace type II hair cells. Type I hair cells are not restored by <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></i>-expressing supporting cells or by <i>Atoh1-CreER<sup>TM</sup></i>-expressing type II hair cells. Destruction of hair cells causes supporting cells to generate 6 times as many type II hair cells compared to normal conditions. These findings expand our understanding of sensorineural plasticity in adult vestibular organs and further elucidate the roles that supporting cells serve during homeostasis and after injury."

These cells undergo cell death and replacement (turnover) throughout life in non-mammalian vertebrates. However, there is no definitive evidence that this process occurs in mammals. We used fate-mapping and other methods to demonstrate that utricular type II vestibular hair cells undergo turnover in adult mice under normal conditions. We found that supporting cells phagocytose both type I and II hair cells. <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></i>-expressing supporting cells replace type II hair cells. Type I hair cells are not restored by <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></i>-expressing supporting cells or by <i>Atoh1-CreER<sup>TM</sup></i>-expressing type II hair cells. Destruction of hair cells causes supporting cells to generate 6 times as many type II hair cells compared to normal conditions. These findings expand our understanding of sensorineural plasticity in adult vestibular organs and further elucidate the roles that supporting cells serve during homeostasis and after injury."

The ability of adult rodents to regenerate small numbers of utricular HCs after ototoxin-induced damage is another indicator of plasticity in mammalian vestibular epithelia (<a href=\"#bib25\">Forge et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Warchol et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Forge et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kawamoto et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Golub et al., 2012</a>).

However, fate-mapping indicates that SCs replace only type II HCs, and type II HCs do not convert into type I HCs, at least over the 8-month period of adulthood we examined. When HCs are killed by a toxin, SCs transdifferentiate into 6 times as many type II HCs compared to normal HC addition within the same 4-week period. This study demonstrates that the utricle is an additional neuroepithelium in mammals capable of generating sensory receptor cells throughout adulthood and defines the lineage of new HC production in this mature tissue under normal conditions and after HC damage <i>in vivo</i>."

The utricular sensory epithelium (macula) is composed of an alternating array of SCs and two types of HCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>) and contains the processes of vestibular afferent and efferent nerves (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib22\">Eatock and Songer, 2011</a>). Type I HCs have a flask-shaped body and a nucleus located at mid-epithelial depth, and they synapse onto large calyceal afferents. Type II HCs have complex shapes, with thick necks and basal cytoplasmic processes projecting from the cell body (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Pujol et al., 2014</a>). Each type II HC nucleus is located near the lumenal surface. Type II HCs synapse onto small (bouton) afferents. SCs span the basal-to-apical extent of the epithelium, and their nuclei reside below HC nuclei, near the basal lamina. The utricle is divided into two zones: a C-shaped central region called the striola, in which specialized type I HCs are enriched, and the extrastriolar region, which surrounds the striola and occupies the remainder of the utricle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

In whole-mounted normal utricles, we detected numerous F-actin-rich structures that were basket-like or ring-shaped (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013E\u201d\u2019,G\u2013K\u201d</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), resembling phagosomes described before (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bird et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Monzack et al., 2015</a>). The vast majority of these structures was restricted to the basal compartment of the epithelium, amongst SC nuclei. We counted 48.9 \u00b1 14.8 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) phagosomes per utricle (n = 8; Figure 3A; Figure 3\u2014source data 1). Immunolabeling of myosin VIIa, a HC-specific marker (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hasson et al., 1995</a>), revealed that 21.7% \u00b1 16.1% of phagosomes per utricle were clearly associated with HCs whose cell bodies had been translocated basally to the SC nuclear layer and were therefore considered ectopic (95% confidence interval: 8.8\u201334.6%; n = 6; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013E\u201d\u2019,H\u2013K\u201d</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>).

In 55.2% (\u00b19.7%; 95% confidence interval: 47.5\u201363.0%; n = 6) of associations, phagosomes were composed of a ring-like structure that fully encircled a HC body (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013E\u2019\u201d</a>, arrowheads) and were connected to a basket-like structure devoid of HC material (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013E\u2019\u201d</a>, arrows). Most other phagosomes associated with ectopic HCs consisted of a basket-like structure with one or more F-actin-rich processes that extended laterally and either contacted nearby HCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) or pierced and entered their cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H,J,K\u201d</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). In Swiss Webster mice, we counted 12 \u00b1 9.9 ectopic HCs per utricle that were associated with phagosomes (95% confidence interval: 4.3\u201320.1; n = 6). However, the majority of phagosomes (71.7% \u00b1 14.3%; 95% confidence interval: 60.3\u201383.1%; n = 6) lacked HC staining within or around them (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> inset), suggesting they may be clearing other cell types or being retracted after completion of HC digestion."

We found evidence that both type I and type II HCs were being targeted by phagosomes. SOX2 is a transcription factor that is abundant in SCs and type II HCs, but is not found in type I HCs (<a href=\"#bib65\">Oesterle et al., 2008</a>). Some phagosomes were associated with a myosin VIIa-positive cell whose nucleus was SOX2-positive (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). In other utricles, we found phagosome-associated HCs that were immunoreactive for the calcium-binding protein, calretinin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>), which is selectively elevated in type II HCs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Desai et al., 2005</a>). Some phagosomes engulfed cells that were immunoreactive for tenascin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K\u2013K\u201d</a>), an extracellular matrix protein that lines the space between the type I HC plasma membrane and the afferent calyx (<a href=\"#bib81\">Swartz and Santi, 1999</a>). Further, one ectopic HC in transverse plastic sections was wrapped by a calyceal afferent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), identifiable by its electron-lucent appearance except for scattered mitochondria, which is typical of a type I HC."

To determine if this also occurs under normal conditions, we labeled utricles with antibodies to espin and plasma membrane calcium ATPase 2 (PMCA2), which are reported to label stereocilia, but not other structures in the sensory epithelium (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dumont et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Li et al., 2004</a>). As anticipated, stereocilia were brightly labeled with both antibodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a> insets). Occasional ectopic HCs were diffusely labeled by either antibody (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,C\u201d</a>, espin labeling), but none of them contained brightly labeled foci resembling stereocilia (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D\u201d</a>). Thus, our observations suggest that the apical part of the HC is ejected apically prior to translocation or that stereocilia degenerate during translocation. Interestingly, espin antibodies labeled most actin-rich spikes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013C\u201d</a>). Initially, we thought this could indicate that spikes are derived from stereocilia. However, spikes were not labeled for antibodies to PMCA2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013D\u201d</a>), suggesting this is not the case. Perhaps espin serves as an actin-bundling protein in phagosome spikes, as it does in stereocilia (<a href=\"#bib95\">Zheng et al., 2000</a>)."

First, we fluorescently labeled the cytoplasm of SCs to assess if they generate actin-rich phagosomes using <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></i> mice, which have been used previously to label SCs in mouse utricles (<a href=\"#bib32\">G\u00f3mez-Casati et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Burns et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). In 6-week-old <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>CAG-loxP-stop-loxP-tdTomato</sup></i> mice (hereafter referred to as <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></i> mice), the majority of SCs were tdTomato-positive at one week after injection of tamoxifen (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). A small number of cells in the transitional epithelium, which borders the sensory epithelium (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), and numerous cells in the stroma (presumed Schwann cells, not shown) were also tdTomato-positive. We sampled 8 regions of the macula and determined that 91.7% (\u00b16.1%; n\u00a0=\u00a03) and 68.4% (\u00b11.8%; n\u00a0=\u00a03) of SCs in the extrastiola and the striola, respectively, were tdTomato-positive (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). In age-matched <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></i> mice that did not receive tamoxifen,\u00a0&lt;5% of SCs per utricle (126.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a046.8; 95% confidence interval: 80.9\u2013172.6; n\u00a0=\u00a04) were tdTomato-positive (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), revealing some tamoxifen-independent Cre activity. We labeled <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></i> utricles collected at one week post tamoxifen with phalloidin to visualize phagosomes and antibodies against myosin VIIa to visualize HCs. We detected an average of 27.8 (\u00b14.3; 95% confidence interval: 23.0\u201332.6; n\u00a0=\u00a03) phagosomes per utricle, which were fewer than Swiss Webster mice, but more than CBA/CaJ and C57Bl/6J mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>) and 4.5 (\u00b12.3; 95% confidence interval: 1.9\u20137.1; n\u00a0=\u00a03) phagosomes were associated with a HC. In some utricles, we detected overlap of tdTomato and phalloidin signals, indicating that some phagosomes were derived from SCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E\u2019</a>). It was unclear if phagosomes were generated by a single SC or by two or more adjacent SCs, but phagosomes were consistently derived from the most basal region of a SC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013E\u2019</a>)."

Two alternatively spliced variants of PCDH15 (CD1 and CD3) are present in mature stereocilia (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahmed et al., 2006</a>).

Thus, PCDH15-CD2 is a selective marker of immature stereocilia. As positive controls, we labeled utricles from neonatal (&lt;8 day-old) Swiss Webster mice with antibodies to PCDH15-CD2 and with phalloidin to mark stereocilia. In the periphery of the utricle, where newly formed HCs are differentiating in neonates (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burns et al., 2012</a>), we detected numerous HCs with PCDH15-CD2 labeling throughout the stereocilia (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

Based on previous work (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Burns et al., 2012</a>), the likely source of new HCs is neighboring SCs. To determine if utricular HCs derive from SCs in normal adult mice, we used <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></i> mice, in which tamoxifen induces tdTomato expression in SCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>).

BrdU was delivered using two different routes of administration (intraperitoneal injection and drinking water) and different dosing regimens for up to two weeks of continuous administration. We examined utricles after BrdU treatment from 18 adult mice, including both C57Bl/6J\u00a0and Swiss Webster strains (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We routinely detected strongly BrdU-labeled nuclei in within-animal positive control tissue (intestinal epithelium and utricular connective tissue), but we found only one example of a BrdU-labeled pair of cells in the utricular macula (not shown). Therefore, if SCs divide during HC turnover, they do so rarely. These observations are consistent with the slow rate of HC addition that we observed and with previous studies of cell division in the macula of normal mice (<a href=\"#bib53\">Li and Forge, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kuntz and Oesterle, 1998</a>)."

This finding raised the question of how type I HCs are maintained in adulthood. We hypothesized that type II HCs might convert into type I HCs. To test this hypothesis, we fate-mapped type II HCs under normal conditions in adult utricles using <i>Atoh1-CreER<sup>TM</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></i> mice in which CreER expression is driven by an <i>Atoh1</i> enhancer (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chow et al., 2006</a>).

Using the same criteria, we determined that 92.7% (\u00b12.8%) of tdTomato-labeled cells were type II HCs and 5.9% (\u00b13.0%) were type I HCs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013F\u201d</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>).

Our data show that, in utricles of adult mice, SCs remove type I and type II HCs under normal physiological conditions by phagocytosis and replace type II HCs by transdifferentiation. This study provides definitive evidence that vestibular epithelia are a site of ongoing HC turnover in adult mammals. In this sense, vestibular epithelia resemble other placodally derived neurosensory epithelia, such as taste buds (<a href=\"#bib66\">Okubo et al., 2009</a>) and olfactory epithelia (<a href=\"#bib51\">Leung et al., 2007</a>), which cull and replace sensory receptors throughout life.

SCs also phagocytose HCs that are injured by ototoxins or intense noise (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abrashkin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bird et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Anttonen et al., 2014</a>). Our results demonstrate an additional, previously unknown role of SCs as phagocytes of type I and II vestibular HCs under normal conditions. While data from both <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></i> and <i>Lfng-eGFP</i> mice support the hypothesis that SCs act as phagocytes to remove HCs, we cannot rule out that other cell types in the organ also play this role. For instance, Schwann cells were also labeled by tdTomato in utricles of <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></i> mice, and they have phagocytic capabilities in the peripheral nervous system (<a href=\"#bib5\">Band et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Reichert et al., 1994</a>). We attempted to assess Schwann cell contribution to phagosomes, but we were unable to identify antibodies or CreER mouse lines that labeled Schwann cells without also labeling SCs. <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></i> mice also labeled cells in the transitional epithelium. However, these cells are unlikely sources of phagosomes, since the majority of phagosomes we observed were located in the central region of the macula, away from the transitional epithelium."

This finding is somewhat counterintuitive, since HC addition appears to be most abundant in the periphery. However, it is possible that HC clearance and HC addition are not spatially coupled. During development, addition of utricular HCs in rodents occurs in a central-to-peripheral gradient (<a href=\"#bib75\">Sans and Chat, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Burns et al., 2012</a>). Since we found HC clearance to be focused centrally, we hypothesize that the oldest HCs are being removed.

However, based on our observations, we generated a model (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>) that should be tested using live-cell imaging and serial immuno-electron microscopy. We propose that the first sign a HC has been \u2018selected\u2019 for clearance is the appearance of a large actin spike in its cytoplasm. Actin-rich cables or \u2018cytocauds\u2019 are also observed in HC cytoplasm of adult utricles in mice (<a href=\"#bib78\">Sobin et al., 1982</a>), guinea pigs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Flock et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kanzaki et al., 2002</a>), and humans (<a href=\"#bib83\">Taylor et al., 2015</a>). We suspect this actin spike is either derived from the HC itself or from a SC that has been signaled to \u2018attack\u2019 the HC. We hypothesize that this spike extends and becomes anchored basally, at which point the HC body is translocated to the basal compartment. Once translocated, adjacent SCs create basket-like phagosomes and consume the HC. However, it is also possible that the actin spike does not play a role in HC clearance. Because we did not detect stereocilia in translocated HCs, we presume that the apical portion of each HC is cleaved by SCs and ejected apically before translocation, similar to what occurs after aminoglycoside toxicity (<a href=\"#bib58\">Meiteles and Raphael, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Li et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bird et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Monzack et al., 2015</a>).

However in normal utricles, we found that HCs are pierced by a single actin spike and translocated to a basal position, which has not been reported after damage. Although the number of phagosomes increased after DT-mediated HC death, the increase was not proportionate to HC loss, and many apoptotic HCs were not localized near phagosomes. These observations suggest that F-actin-rich phagosomes derived from SCs play a minor role in removing HCs in mouse utricles after DT treatment, which is consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kaur et al., 2015</a>). By contrast, F-actin-rich phagosomes derived from SCs actively clear utricular HCs following aminoglycoside treatments in vitro (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bird et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Monzack et al., 2015</a>).

Nonetheless, HCs may be phagocytosed because they become damaged due to normal \u2018wear and tear\u2019 under physiological conditions. Thus, it is important to define the triggers for HC clearance.

Since numbers of HCs are maintained in adult mice, this could suggest that as many as 105 HCs are added per week, which is considerably more than indicated by SC fate-mapping with <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></i> mice.

                                "text": "If we make a conservative estimate, based on SC fate-mapping alone, that 2 HCs are turned over per week, and we consider the mouse\u2019s lifespan to be 18 months, with an average of 4.3 weeks/month, then we can estimate that 155 HCs, or 4% of the HC population, are turned over during a mouse\u2019s lifetime. It seems unlikely that such a small degree of HC turnover would have a significant impact on vestibular homeostasis. However, we found evidence that type I HCs are cleared, but no evidence that type I HCs are replaced. A progressive loss of type I HCs over time or disruption in the balance of type II HC clearance and addition, for example during aging, could result in vestibular dysfunction. <a href=\"#bib67\">Park et al. (1987)</a> measured a\u00a0~14% reduction in utricular HCs in old C57Bl/6NNia mice, and this reduction was similar for both type I and II HCs. By contrast, <a href=\"#bib47\">Kirkegaard and Nyengaard (2005)</a> found no evidence of HC loss in aged outbred mice. Declines in vestibular function accompanying aging have been reported in some strains of mice (<a href=\"#bib76\">Shiga et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Mock et al., 2011</a>) and in humans (e.g., <a href=\"#bib2\">Agrawal et al., 2009</a>), so it is important to further investigate if HC turnover is reduced with aging."

We used several morphological criteria to classify HCs as type I or type II in whole-mounted utricles. These criteria for mice are defined in many publications, including <a href=\"#bib74\">R\u00fcsch et al. (1998)</a> and <a href=\"#bib68\">Pujol et al. (2014)</a>, are described in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, and shown in <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>. Almost all morphological analyses were performed in whole-mount utricles labeled with antibodies to myosin VIIa, which label the cytoplasm of both type I and type II HCs. We acquired z-series images through the entire sensory epithelium (from the lumen through the basal lamina) in striolar and extrastriolar regions. Images were analyzed thoroughly off-line by scanning up and down through the z-series, examining the entire body of each HC. This approach allowed us to assess all criteria in each image and compare features amongst several cells. Four morphological criteria were used to classify HCs across all regions of the utricle: thickness of the apical cytoplasm, thickness of the perinuclear cytoplasm, size and shape of the nucleus, and presence/absence of basolateral processes. The apical cytoplasm of type I HCs constricts significantly below the cuticular plate, while the apical cytoplasm of type II HCs does not. The perinuclear cytoplasm is very thin in type I HCs and considerably thicker in type II HCs. The nuclei in type I HCs are smaller and round, while the nuclei of type II HCs are larger and oblong. The clearest distinguishing features between type I and II HCs throughout the entire utricle (striola and extrastriola) are basolateral processes (<a href=\"#bib68\">Pujol et al., 2014</a>), which are cytoplasmic portions of type II HCs that extend below the nucleus and are fully labeled by anti-myosin VIIa antibodies. In the extrastriola (the largest area in the utricle), there is a fifth powerful criterion for HC typing: the nuclei of type I and II HCs are located in distinct near-monolayers. Type II HC nuclei are consistently located apical to type I HC nuclei (<a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>). In the striola, where type II and type I HC nuclei are less clearly stratified, we used the 4 criteria listed above\u2014thickness of the apical and perinuclear cytoplasm, nuclear size and shape, and presence or absence of a basolateral process. In studies with <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></i> and <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup>:Pou4f3<sup>DTR</sup></i> mice, the cytoplasm of most SCs was labeled with tdTomato. As a result, we had another criterion to help us with typing: type II HCs were completely encompassed by the tdTomato-positive SC processes, while type I HCs had an unlabeled gap around them, which was the calyx. Any cells that did not clearly match criteria described above for any analysis were scored as an \u2018unknown.\u2019"

This number of hair cells, if I'm not mistaken, represents a very small% of total hair cells in the utricle, making me wonder what is the physiological relevance of these findings. Furthermore, the number of cells replaced is much lower in several strains, further questioning the functional impact of such process. Does this percentage increase over a longer period of time? Are these tdTomato-traced cells functional? The replaced hair cells typically have shorter stereocilia bundles, how does this affect hair cell function?

The authors suggest that these structures indicate a homeostatic(?) removal process for hair cells during the \"normal\" lifespan of a mouse and so predict that there should be immature cells that need to be added in order to maintain cell numbers. They find that adult mouse utricles do have hair cells with \"immature\" characteristics, as has been suggested by other work, and then use an Atoh1-GFP mouse to provide support for this finding (since we know that with maturation AtoH1 expression is significantly reduced as hair cells mature). Furthermore, they use the PlpCRE reporter mice to determine the number of hair cells that are derived from Plp-expressing cells and find that this number increases over a period of 15 weeks after Cre activation \u2013 an addition of ~30 cells over 15 weeks. Detailed analysis revealed that it was almost exclusively the Type II hair cell that was added during this period, and using another mouse model they show that the Type II hair cells do not convert to the other Type I hair cells, at least over the 15 week period monitored. Finally, by crossing their PlP reporter mice with a Pou4f3-Diphtheria Toxin mouse (that they have described previously) the authors showed that the ablation of hair cells resulted in a substantial increase (6x) in the numbers of tdTom-positive hair cells i.e. hair cells derived from SCs"

Unfortunately, despite considerable effort, we were not able to find antibodies that label Schwann cells but not SCs or evidence of CreER mouse lines that target Schwann cells specifically. This is also true for cells in the transitional epithelium (TE). Thus, new tools are needed to delineate what, if any, contribution Schwann cells or TE cells make to the production of phagosomes and the addition of HCs in the normal utricle. However, we have included new data to further support the interpretation that many phagosomes derive from SCs. The <i>Lfng-eGFP</i> mouse expresses eGFP specifically in SCs in vestibular epithelia, but not in Schwann cells or TE cells (see revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a> and Burns et al., 2015 Nat Comm). In <i>Lfng-eGFP</i> mice, eGFP is expressed in the majority of SCs, and we observed co-localization of eGFP with F-actin rich phagosomes. This supports our findings using <i>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup> </i>mice that SCs can act as phagosomes. We have included these new data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H\u2013I\u201d</a> and in Results (subsection \u201cSCs clear HCs from adult mouse utricles under normal conditions\u201d, second paragraph) and Materials and methods (subsection \u201cMouse models\").

Our previous work showed a loss of &gt;2000 HCs over the first week post-DT (Golub et al., 2012), so the increase of phagosomes we observed (~5 per utricle) in this time is much less than the thousands of HCs that need to be cleared. Kaur et al. (2015) described macrophage infiltration in DT-treated mouse utricles to clear HC debris, and these macrophages did not overlap with the F-actin-rich phagosome structures that we attribute to SCs. Thus, it is likely that SCs form phagosomes for normal HC turnover and minimally increase their phagocytic activity after damage. We also found that phagosomes in <i>Pou4f3<sup>DTR</sup></i> mice were located in the normal HC layer, which contrasts with the basal location of phagosomes in normal utricles in the SC nuclear layer. In addition, some HCs in <i>Pou4f3<sup>DTR</sup></i> mice co-localized with TUNEL or had apoptotic features in their nuclei, but these cells with apoptotic features were not associated with phagosomes. This contrasts with normal utricles, in which HCs associated with phagosomes had normal chromatin and no signs of apoptosis.

After utricular HC damage by aminoglycosides, others have reported that the apical portion of the HC is cleaved and ejected but the cell body degenerates within the epithelium (Li et al., 1995; Bird et al., 2010; Monzack et al., 2015). To determine if the apical portion of HCs are also ejected under normal conditions, we acquired new data where normal utricles were labeled with antibodies to espin and PMCA2, which label stereocilia but not other structures in the sensory epithelium (Dumont et al., 2001; Li et al., 2004). While we detected bright labeling with each antibody in stereocilia, none of the HCs associated with phagosomes contained brightly labeled foci resembling stereocilia. This finding suggests that the apical part of the HC is ejected apically prior to translocation or that stereocilia degenerate during translocation, during normal clearance. Interestingly, espin antibodies did label the actin-rich spikes. Initially, we thought this could indicate the spike is derived from stereocilia. However, spikes were not labeled for antibodies to PMCA2, suggesting that this is not the case.
