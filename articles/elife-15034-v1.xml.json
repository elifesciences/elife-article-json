We took an unbiased approach based on in vivo clonal labeling and tracking of biliary epithelial cells in the three-dimensional landscape, in combination with mathematical simulation, to understand their mode of proliferation in a mouse liver injury model where the nascent biliary structure formed in a tissue-intrinsic manner. An apparent heterogeneity among biliary epithelial cells was observed: whereas most of the responders that entered the cell cycle upon injury exhibited a limited and tapering growth potential, a select population continued to proliferate, making a major contribution in sustaining the biliary expansion. Our study has highlighted a unique mode of epithelial tissue dynamics, which depends not on a hierarchical system driven by fixated stem cells, but rather, on a stochastically maintained progenitor population with persistent proliferative activity."

We took an unbiased approach based on in vivo clonal labeling and tracking of biliary epithelial cells in the three-dimensional landscape, in combination with mathematical simulation, to understand their mode of proliferation in a mouse liver injury model where the nascent biliary structure formed in a tissue-intrinsic manner. An apparent heterogeneity among biliary epithelial cells was observed: whereas most of the responders that entered the cell cycle upon injury exhibited a limited and tapering growth potential, a select population continued to proliferate, making a major contribution in sustaining the biliary expansion. Our study has highlighted a unique mode of epithelial tissue dynamics, which depends not on a hierarchical system driven by fixated stem cells, but rather, on a stochastically maintained progenitor population with persistent proliferative activity."

In the adult liver, these cells are maintained in a quiescent state in which they stable epithelial sheets and tubules.\u00a0They enter dynamic regeneration processes once the organ suffers tissue loss or various types of injury. In particular, the regeneration process that responds to chronic injury involves drastic changes in the morphology and phenotype of liver epithelial tissues, and in both human pathologies and animal models\u00a0often accompanies a phenomenon called the\u00a0ductular reaction (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gouw et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Michalopoulos and Khan, 2015</a>). The\u00a0ductular reaction has been histologically characterized as the\u00a0ectopic emergence and expansion of BEC-marker-positive cells in the liver parenchymal region. After\u00a0using newly established imaging approaches to capture three-dimensional (3D) tissue morphology in situ, we recently reported that such a phenomenon results from\u00a0dynamic and adaptive structural changes in intra-hepatic biliary tree architecture (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kaneko et al., 2015</a>). Thus, ductular reaction essentially represents drastic and complex remodeling of the biliary epithelial tissue, which is likely to be regulated by a sophisticated mechanism that controls\u00a0BEC proliferation."

Several lines of evidence involving knock-out mice for regulatory signals, such as TWEAK, HGF/c-Met and FGF7, have collectively demonstrated that the\u00a0suppression or failure of ductular reaction leads to exacerbated liver injury and severe defects in liver regeneration (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ishikawa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Takase et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lu et al., 2015</a>). However, the in vivo behavior and manner of growth\u00a0of\u00a0BECs during biliary tree remodeling remains largely unknown. For many years, ductular reaction has been regarded and studied as a model that represents the activation of adult liver stem/progenitor cells, which may reside in the biliary tree and which\u00a0can differentiate into hepatocytes or BECs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Duncan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Miyajima et al., 2014</a>). Although in vitro studies have demonstrated the presence of clonogenic cells in the biliary compartment that are highly proliferative under culture conditions (<a href=\"#bib22\">Miyajima et al., 2014</a>), the in vivo existence and behavior of such proliferative BEC subpopulations remain unclear. This was partly because many recent studies employing genetic-lineage tracing approaches in vivo have\u00a0focused on the trans-differentiation capacities of BECs and of\u00a0hepatocytes, rather than on\u00a0the mode of proliferation of BECs themselves (<a href=\"#bib11\">Grompe, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Michalopoulos and Khan, 2015</a>)"

A clonal cell tracing study on BECs was recently reported (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tarlow et al., 2014b</a>)\u00a0that focused solely on the clonal differentiation potential of both hepatocyte and BEC lineages, but not on the clone size (representing the clonal growth potential). Thus, the\u00a0exact cell numbers of BEC-derived clones were not quantified. The biliary tree has\u00a0a highly complex and fine structure (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kaneko et al., 2015</a>),\u00a0thus it is practically impossible to count or even estimate the number of BECs that\u00a0reside in it using conventional histological analysis in tissue sections.

We also confirmed that no leakiness of labeling occurred in the absence of tamoxifen administration (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

We analyzed the\u00a0expression of several molecular markers that are associated with BECs/LPCs, including EpCAM, CK19, Prom1, Spp1 (also known as osteopontin), and MIC1-1C3. Upon DDC administration for 8 weeks, we detected many Spp1<sup>+</sup> cells in the tdTomato-labeled population, but we\u00a0did not detect any EpCAM<sup>+</sup> tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells in this population (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). This indicates that while hepatocytes can indeed gain a 'biliary' phenotype in terms of Spp1 expression, they are still not fully converted to BECs as defined by EpCAM expression. FACS analysis using the MIC1-1C3 surface antigen instead of Spp1 also revealed that hepatocytes contributed to the MIC1-1C3<sup>+\u00a0</sup>'biliary' population but not to that of the EpCAM<sup>+</sup> subset (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). We also examined the expression patterns of Prom1 and CK19 and found that they were essentially the same as that of EpCAM, but they\u00a0were different from those of Spp1 and MIC1-1C3 (data not shown). These results are consistent with the report by Tarlow et.\u00a0al. (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tarlow et al., 2014a</a>)\u00a0showing that Spp1<sup>+</sup> MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> proliferating ductular cells derived from hepatocytes upon DDC injury (which they named hepPDs) are distinct from those derived from pre-existing BECs (which they named bilPDs) with respect to the gene expression profile. Specifically, such hepatocyte-derived cells (hepPDs) show little or no expression of CK19, EpCAM, or Prom1. We also estimated the contribution of hepPDs to the biliary population using our BEC labeling system, in\u00a0which a decrease in the\u00a0labeling ratio of BECs would be expected if a large number of hepatocytes converted into BECs. We found no significant decrease of labeling ratio after DDC administration in EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells. The ratio might be slightly decreased in MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> cells, but this remains to be confirmed as statistically significant (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Considering the relatively small contribution of the hepatocyte-derived cells to the entire MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> population upon DDC injury (1.88% in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the result overall is\u00a0consistent with that of the hepatocyte-tracing experiments using the AAV system."

Consistently, FACS analysis detected no MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> cells or EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells in the tdTomato<sup>+</sup> population (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>), further confirming the notion that hepatocytes do not convert into either BECs (or bilPDs) or BEC-like cells (or hepPDs) in the course of TAA-induced liver injury, even after 8 weeks. Again, the expression patterns of Prom1 and CK19 were the same as that of EpCAM, but different from those of Spp1 and MIC1-1C3 (data not shown). Thus, Spp1 and MIC1-1C3 mark a different and broader cell population from\u00a0that defined by the expression of CK19, EpCAM and Prom1. We concluded that hepatocyte-derived duct-like cells (hepPDs) do emerge in the DDC model but not in the TAA model, and that they are distinguishable from bilPDs. This finding may be of pathophysiological relevance, in that the DDC model is a cholestatic liver injury model that primarily targets the biliary epithelial system, whereas\u00a0the TAA model\u00a0is a hepatotoxic injury model with less severe cholestatic disease phenotypes."

After single-cell labeling, mice were subjected to the TAA protocol and the size of single-cell-derived clonal progenies were analyzed during the course of injury progression.

We classified the biliary epithelial tissue into two distinct portions according to\u00a0their tube diameter sizes and locations, namely 'duct' and 'peripheral ductule', as we anticipated a putative relationship between the tissue architecture and cell proliferation capacity. This highlighted two important features\u00a0of colony size distribution. First, the duct compartment contained\u00a0no large colonies of more than five cells, while the peripheral ductule compartment did\u00a0contain large colonies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e\u2013g</a>). Notably, we found\u00a0no large colonies that were directly connected to the duct cells adjacent to PV. Thus, it is not likely that some proliferative cells reside in a fixed position in the duct compartment\u00a0and continuously supply progeny toward the periphery. Rather, the colony-initiating, proliferative cells may reside in the peripheral ductule compartment and relocate their position upon parenchymal injury."

We searched\u00a03D images of the biliary tree for any structural feature corresponding to the location of cycling cells by immunostaining for the cell-proliferation marker Ki67. Most of the Ki67<sup>+</sup> BECs localized to the peripheral area of the biliary tree in the TAA injured liver, whereas only a few Ki67<sup>+</sup> BECs were seen in the duct around the PV area (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This distribution pattern fits well with the results of the clonal cell tracing experiments. In the peripheral ductule compartment, the Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells were widely scattered. No further sign of a\u00a0defined stem cell niche, such as a cluster or aligned arrangement of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells, was observed. At 2 weeks of TAA administration, Ki67<sup>+</sup> BECs were already enriched in the peripheral ductule region, and scattered therein, rather than in\u00a0the ducts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>).\u00a0This suggests that the mode of proliferation is maintained over time.

First, mice were administered with BrdU continuously for 8 days to label in vivo as many proliferating cells as possible (1<sup>st</sup> label). After a short interval, mice were then administered the other nucleotide analog, EdU, for pulse labeling (2<sup>nd</sup> label) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). The rationale for this consecutive and double labeling experiment is as follows. If BECs can be classified into two distinct states: an\u00a0actively and continuously dividing state and a\u00a0quiescent state, then those BECs\u00a0that are subjected to the 2<sup>nd</sup> labeling (corresponding to the actively and continuously dividing cells) should also have\u00a0undergone the 1<sup>st</sup> labeling and thus\u00a0are mostly observed as the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> label double-positive population. Conversely, if BECs are able to convert between the proliferative and quiescent states reversibly, they can divide at arbitrary time points and hence the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd\u00a0</sup>labelings will\u00a0occur independently. In this case, significant numbers of the 2<sup>nd</sup> label single-positive cells should be observed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). This experimental strategy can thus allow us to reveal the mode of cell proliferation in terms of the cells' potential for\u00a0short-term transition between the proliferative and quiescent states. We must\u00a0note that the definition of proliferative capacity in this particular set of experiments is based on relatively short-term cell behavior, and the proliferative or quiescent state of a current cell does not apply to its progeny. In other words, BECs are classified by their transient cell division manner, but they are not restricted to this state permanently."

As stated before, we recognized that the most distinctive feature of the quantitative clonal tracing data was the heterogeneity in BECs with regard to proliferative activity, as manifested by the\u00a0uni-modality and long-tailed pattern of the colony size distribution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g and i</a>). To construct a model that recapitulates this feature, we hypothesized that there must be a factor that accounts for the\u00a0heterogeneous proliferative capacities of each cell. Thus, we incorporated a stochastic cell behavior into our two-state growth model, in that a cell in the proliferative state can alter its growth state to the quiescent state in a probabilistic manner (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). We\u00a0use\u00a0the term 'stochastic' here in exactly the same manner as\u00a0in\u00a0previous studies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Doup\u00e9 et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Driessens et al., 2012</a>): to describe that the state of each cell is unpredictable rather than being fixed or pre-determined, with the\u00a0total proportion of cells\u00a0in\u00a0each divergent\u00a0state being balanced. It is important to note that the concept of stochastic growth does not mean that the transition process occurs in a non-regulated manner. There are indeed\u00a0factors that\u00a0regulate cellular growth state and behavior, although\u00a0the switching and maintenance of each cell's state, timing of each cell division, and duration of each cell cycle 'appear' to\u00a0be stochastic. Such stochastic behavior has already been shown to exist in progenitor cells in the interfolliculer epidermis (IFE) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Doup\u00e9 et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Driessens et al., 2012</a>), and we defined parameters on the basis of that IFE model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). As expected, the model with the stochastic feature produced a widespread distribution in colony size, with each single proliferating cell yielding colonies of various sizes along\u00a0the time course (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>)."

A simulation result\u00a0for 8-day injury period fitted significantly better with the experimental data for 2-week tracing\u00a0than did simulated data for 2 weeks of injury, implying a gap of several days between the timing of colony formation in vivo and in silico.

Here, we sought to reveal this relationship by focusing on the\u00a0ductular reaction, a unique and dynamic remodeling of the intrahepatic biliary tree that\u00a0occurs\u00a0upon chronic liver injury. Our results have delineated a progressing morphological transformation of the peripheral ductular structure in the TAA model, which is primarily achieved by a tissue-intrinsic cell expansion within the pre-existing biliary epithelium. Intriguingly, the expansion of biliary epithelial tissue is dictated by heterogeneous and stochastic behavior of BECs. Thus, a subset of proliferating BECs that is stochastically maintained, rather than a pre-determined and hard-wired progenitor population, exhibits clonogenic growth potential in vivo and plays a central role in the remodeling of biliary epithelial tissue."

In many instances, the architecture of the biliary tree is illustrated as a simple monolayer tube with a luminal structure that\u00a0corresponds\u00a0to the ducts, with little or no attention being paid to the presence of peripheral ductules. However, it is the ductule compartment, rather than the ducts, that makes a key contribution to tissue remodeling, as exemplified by the fact that the majority of the proliferating BECs reside in the peripheral ductule region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4g</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Structural and functional units found in many different organs, such as the intestinal crypt and the hair follicle, exhibit fairly ordered structure in that they are reiteratively aligned in quasi-two-dimensional sheet-like tissue structures. By contrast, the biliary tree, especially the ductule compartment, spreads omni-directionally and it is quite difficult to capture its structure comprehensively and reproducibly. Therefore, it is necessary to use 3D-imaging methods to capture the tissue structures and cellular growth dynamics therein accurately and precisely. In order to observe detailed features and connectivity within the biliary tree structure in the liver, we have established a novel 3D staining and imaging method. There are substantial gains to be made by adapting the method so that it can be performed easily and effectively with minimum time and cost, especially for experiments\u00a0such as quantitative single cell tracing analysis in which large numbers of samples must be handled. We have thoroughly optimized our 3D imaging protocol at various steps to render it easy and cost-effective; our protocol does not require expensive reagents or specialized equipment,\u00a0and\u00a0thus provides a versatile method for studying various tissue structures in the liver, as well as in other organs."

First, the biliary epithelial tissue can be subdivided into two classes, namely the duct and peripheral ductule compartments, on the basis of morphological and geographical characteristics. At the population level, the BECs in the peripheral\u00a0ductule\u00a0compartment have higher proliferative tendency than those in the ducts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4g</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, among the BECs in the peripheral ductule compartment, there exists further heterogeneity in terms of the proliferative behavior. Not all of\u00a0the ductule cells exhibit a\u00a0proliferative response upon injury, and the size of the colonies varies even among the proliferative population. Both of these levels of heterogeneity can be explained by our mathematical model. The model predicts the initial ratio of the\u00a0proliferating BEC population to be p=0.465, meaning that the majority of BECs do not divide in response to the injury stimulus. This is consistent with the notion that the duct compartment cells, which constitute the major part of the BEC population under the normal condition, do not or rarely divide upon injury (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The proliferative heterogeneity in the peripheral ductule compartment is well represented in the model as change\u00a0in\u00a0stochastic growth state (i.e., proliferating vs. non-proliferating states) of BECs."

We think that\u00a0this discrepancy may be due to the role of BECs in vivo. During the remodeling and growth process in biliary epithelial tissue, BECs must form a functional tubular structure. We assume that BECs may gain a type of steady-state phenotype (or, become more matured and differentiated cells) in order to generate and maintain a functional and robust epithelial tubular structure. From this point of view, it is reasonable to assume that their\u00a0proliferation state changes irreversibly in vivo. Unfortunately, we do not yet have an established\u00a0marker that can clearly distinguish BECs in different stages in the course of their functional differentiation and maturation, which prevented us from directly evaluating this possibility. Nevertheless, it could be supported in part by our findings that revealed the relationship between the proliferative capacity of BECs and structural features of the biliary tree (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g</a>), as BECs constituting different tissue structures may be in distinct differentiation stages."

                        "text": "The opposing concepts of 'stochastic' versus 'deterministic' cell-fate decisions\u00a0have been established as an important paradigm in stem-cell biology (<a href=\"#bib24\">O'Neill and Schaffer, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Enver et al., 2009</a>). It should be noted that the concept of stochastic\u00a0versus\u00a0deterministic regulation, which relates\u00a0to\u00a0<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>, does not refute the existence of temporal proliferative sub-states, as shown in the dual nucleotide labeling experiment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Here, the\u00a0deterministic model refers to restriction of a cell to a state that is permanently fixed. In both models, cells are divided into sub-populations according to their transient proliferative state, rather than according to their\u00a0permanent state. Thus, the\u00a0existence of a\u00a0proliferative state does not refute the stochastic model, and the\u00a0existence of a\u00a0temporal proliferative state does not simply mean that cell proliferation follows\u00a0the deterministic model. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that\u00a0govern the\u00a0maintenance and regulation of cells are defined differently\u00a0in the stochastic and deterministic models. In the stochastic model, tissue stem cells,\u00a0for\u00a0example, have non-uniform cell fate and the consequences of cell fate selection are not predictable, whereas in the\u00a0deterministic model, the stem cells give rise to their progeny uniformly and stably. The\u00a0stochastic growth model first emerged in the 1960s, in order to explain the heterogeneous behavior of transplanted hematopoietic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Siminovitch et al., 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Till et al., 1964</a>). Since then, many studies have revealed the existence and role of stochastic\u00a0behaviour\u00a0in various phenomena in living things (<a href=\"#bib28\">Samoilov et al., 2006</a>). In our simulation, we used a stochastic feature to model not only\u00a0the cell-fate decision process but also the regulation of the cell cycle length (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In our\u00a0mathematical simulation, we defined quiescent cells as those that do not divide at all,\u00a0thus\u00a0we do not need to consider their cell cycle length. We did, however, have to consider the cell cycle length of proliferative cells. We first ran many simulations with a\u00a0uniform cell cycle length for all cells. We found, however, that the best fit was achieved when we allowed variation in cell-cycle length among the cells. This variation was defined as the parameter m (see 'Materials and methods' for details). Interestingly, this result agrees with the notion proposed by Spencer et al. (<a href=\"#bib31\">Spencer et al., 2013</a>), confirmed by their single-cell experimental system, that there is substantial cell-to-cell variation in cell cycle\u00a0lengths and delay between mitogen re-stimulation and CDK activation. They also reported that cells had heterogeneous inter-mitotic times, ranging from 20\u2009hr to &gt;50\u2009hr. This fits well with our stochastic proliferation model whose definitions include varying inter-mitotic times."

This fits the structural features of the biliary tree\u00a0well in many regards. First, as the injury progressed, the biliary tree formed numerous arborization and branch ends around the injured area (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e\u2013h</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, the location of cycling cells appeared to be scattered at the 3D level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Such frequent remodeling and sporadic proliferation are well suited to the stochastic\u00a0growth model, which can maintain a spatiotemporally flexible population of\u00a0proliferating cells. Second, the stochastic model is consistent with diversity in tissue structure at the micro scale. In microscopic view, the stochastic system shows a degree of instability because the cell state may fluctuate and the output may be unpredictable. This feature nicely\u00a0explains the dynamics of biliary remodeling, in that the detailed shape and degree of expansion of the extended biliary tree varied in each small area of interest (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2h</a>). This is why the architecture of the biliary tree looks complicated when observed by 2D liver section. Thus, the instability shown in the stochastic model matches the microscopic structural diversity of the biliary tree. Third, we focus on a macroscopic\u00a0feature. In our stochastic model, each cell behaves in a flexible manner, but the\u00a0total percentages of cells that take each\u00a0cell-fate decision is strictly defined and follows a particular value at the population level (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). This feature of the\u00a0stochastic model makes the simulation outcome converge into an ordered pattern (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>). In other words, the stochastic growth mode provides a\u00a0stable, robust and consistent outcome in a macroscopic view. This macroscopic feature corresponds to the biliary tree architecture in the macroscopic view, as the biliary tree appears to follow a uniform pattern in both the spatial and temporal terms when it is observed at\u00a0a large scale (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

In many studies, the number of cells in a colony has been calculated or estimated on the basis of data obtained from 2D sectioned images. For example, in a previous study in which a similar statistical method was employed to reveal the growth mode of the epidermis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Driessens et al., 2012</a>), the number of cells in a clone (clone size) was estimated from 2D section images. This was because the clones formed in the epidermis had an ordered shape and the actual clone size was well correlated with the estimations that can be derived from 2D section images. In stark contrast, the biliary tree exhibits branching and diversified 3D structures, which become far more complex under the liver injury condition, so that it is practically difficult to estimate\u00a0clone sizes accurately from 2D section images. Hence, we chose to perform 3D imaging followed by direct cell counting to quantify the exact cell number in each colony. This approach is more time consuming than those relying on 2D image analyses, but it can reduce potential experimental errors and artifacts that might otherwise\u00a0occur when calculating or estimating clone size."

This resulted in extremely low density (or, incidence) of labeled clones in the liver tissues, so that it was necessary to examine and observe vast numbers of samples in order for us to achieve data with enough size. One section of a 300\u2009\u03bcm thickness has an equivalent data size to 30 sheets of 10-\u03bcm-thick 2D sections.

We speculated that irreversible cell fate changes (in\u00a0which BECs can change from the proliferating state to the quiescent state but not from the quiescent state to the proliferating state) took place, and the experimental results supported this hypothesis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b,e</a>)."

In theory, if our speculation represents\u00a0reality and the experiment worked perfectly, the percentage of the BrdU and EdU double-positive cells in the EdU-positive population should reach 100%. In practice, however, it was approximately 80% (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). A plausible explanation for this observed discrepancy is that the proportion is lower than the theoretical value (100%) when the 1st labeling fails to label proliferative cells completely, even when BrdU is administered continuously. We assumed that this was probably the case, and thus\u00a0that\u00a0the lower level of labeling might be explained by the stochastic characteristics of cell growth. We administered BrdU continuously for 8 days to achieve the maximum level of the 1st labeling so that the entire population of the proliferating cells could be labeled. According to the results of simulation, the cell division rate (denoted as 'm'), corresponding to the probability that\u00a0any\u00a0given cell will enter the cell cycle\u00a0during\u00a0a day, was relatively low (m\u00a0=\u00a00.175). In our stochastic model, the timing of the cell cycle entry per day was defined as\u00a0a\u00a0Bernoulli process. In this scenario, the final labeling rate of the 1st labeling was expected to be approximately 78.5% (if m\u00a0=\u00a00.175, then 1-(1-m)\u00a0^\u00a08\u00a0=\u00a00.78539). Thus, the observed discrepancy between the experimental data and the theoretical value for the proportion of the BrdU and EdU double-positive cells was brought about inherently and could be explained\u00a0by the proliferative behavior of BECs. Our stochastic model and the quantitative data in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> are mutually consistent with each other."

The dual labeling experiments in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> suggest that BECs do indeed exist in one of two states \u2013 proliferative vs. non-proliferative. On the other hand, the fact that the distribution of colony size in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> is non-Gaussian does not rule out the possibility that statistical variation could account for the presence of the large colonies. In terms of the observation that proliferating cells form larger colonies in the ductular than in the ductal compartment, have the authors envisaged the possibility that the length of the cell cycle differs in duct and ductule cells? In addition, the irreversible switch to a quiescent state does not seem to fit with the notion proposed by Spencer et al., namely that the balance between quiescence and proliferation is controlled after each cell cycle at the end of mitosis (Spencer et al. Cell, 155(2):369-832013). Could the authors discuss this issue?"

The dual labeling experiments indicate that there are proliferative and non-proliferative subsets of BECs, suggesting a deterministic (intrinsic) property. However, if a few \"lucky\" clones have proliferated more to give rise to the large colonies in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, this would suggest a stochastic (random variation) model of expansion. This section needs to be substantially re-written to be understandable by a general reader, particularly if the term stochastic growth regulation is to remain in the title."

They reported that hepatocyte-derived biliary-like cells, hepPDs, were able to be characterized as Sox9<sup>+</sup>, Spp1<sup>+</sup>, MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup>, but EpCAM<sup>-</sup>, CK19<sup>-</sup>, Prom1<sup>-</sup>. They also reported that pre-existing biliary cells that expand upon liver injury, bilPDs, are Sox9<sup>+</sup>, Spp1<sup>+</sup>, MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup>, and EpCAM<sup>+</sup>, CK19<sup>+</sup>, Prom1<sup>+</sup>. We re-analyzed and summarized their data on gene expression profiles in hepPDs, bilPDs and hepatocytes (GSE5552) in an additional figure for the referees (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>). The data clearly indicates phenotypic difference between hepPDs and bilPDs in terms of expression patterns of the aforementioned biliary markers. Importantly, our intent is not to deny the conversion (or trans-differentiation) of hepatocytes into biliary lineage, but to reiterate that previous reports and our results show that hepatocyte-derived biliary cells (hepPDs) are different from bilPDs derived from pre-existing biliary cells. Tarlow et al. showed hepPDs are different from bilPDs in terms of the ontogeny and gene expression profiles, and our data further supported this by showing that these populations were different from each other in terms of 3D structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>). This means we can (and should) analyze the proliferative capacity of biliary cells that are derived from pre-existing biliary cells separately from those of hepatocytes-derived cells."

We have included data in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>in the revised manuscript. Mice were administered tamoxifen (10 mg/mouse). In that condition, around 30% of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> BECs were labeled by the tdTomato reporter, and around 16% of MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> cells were labeled. Then mice were fed with DDC diet for 8 weeks. FACS analyses were performed to quantify the labeling rate of BECs before/after liver injury with two different BEC markers, EpCAM and MIC1-1C3. As expected, we did not find a decrease in labeling rate in EpCAM+ populations after DDC administration. We found tendency for the labeling rate in MIC1-1C3+ populations to be reduced, but were unable to confirm whether the observed difference was significant (N=2 for the normal and DDC conditions, respectively). The percentage of the MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> tdTomato<sup>+</sup> populations was: 16.4% and 15.7% for the normal condition (N=2); and, 14.4% and 15.3% for the DDC condition (N=2). Unfortunately, we did not have any more mice that were available for the analysis during the two-month period allowed for revision. Considering the relatively small contribution of the hepatocyte-derived cells to the entire MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> population upon DDC injury (1.88%, shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> in the revised manuscript), the result is overall consistent with that of the hepatocyte lineage tracing data because most of hepatocyte-derived biliary cells (hepPDs) are MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> and EpCAM<sup>-</sup>."

The definition was based on statistic relationships of \u201ctwo cell divisions\u201d (1st labeling the and 2nd labeling). Thus, the term proliferative or non-proliferative refer to temporal state of cell division (two rounds of cell cycle), and we did not define the state, proliferative or quiescent, to be perpetually proliferating. From this experiment, we cannot make assumptions about the whole history of cell fate (that may contain large number of cell division) during colony formation in chronic liver injury periods by TAA. And importantly, there exists the possibility that proliferative cells could be changed into the non-proliferative state, though we do not know when this may occur. Thus, existence of proliferative state does not refute the stochastic model, and existence of temporal proliferative state does not simply mean the deterministic model. In order to generate a model that considers the whole history of cell divisions, we had to perform simulation analysis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> in the revised manuscript)."

However, we found that the best fit was achieved when we allowed for variation of cell cycle length among the cells. The variation was defined as the parameter m (See Supplementary Methods for details). Interestingly, this result agrees with the notion proposed by Spencer et al. (Spencer et al. Cell, 155(2):369-383, 2013; which was suggested by the reviewers in the comment below). Briefly, the study confirmed by their single cell experimental system that there is a large cell-to-cell variation of cell cycles and delay between mitogen re-stimulation and CDK activation. They also reported that the cells had heterogeneous inter-mitotic times ranging from 20 hr to &gt;50 hr. This fits well with our stochastic proliferation model, because we defined our model to have various inter-mitotic times."

It is true that there is some discrepancy, as well as common points. We think the discrepancy may be due to the role of BECs in vivo. During tissue remodeling and tissue growth process of biliary epithelial cells, BECs must form a functional tubular structure. We assume that BECs must gain a sort of steady-state phenotype (or, become more matured and differentiated cells) in order to generate and maintain a functional and robust epithelial tubular structure. From this point of view, it is reasonable to assume that proliferation state changes irreversibly in vivo. Unfortunately, there is no established marker so far that can clearly distinguish different stages of BECs in the course of their functional differentiation and maturation, which prevented us from directly evaluating this possibility. Nevertheless, the assumption could be supported partially by our findings that revealed the relationship between the proliferative capacity of BECs and structural feature of the biliary tree (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), as BECs constituting different tissue structures may be in distinct differentiation stages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a> in the revised manuscript).

We hope the re-defining and words revision make our concept clearer. Basically, our word definition is the same as that of a previous report (Doupe, et al., 2010). We showed the existence of proliferative and non-proliferative states in BECs, but this does not mean that they are deterministic. Here, deterministic refers to restriction of the cell to a state that is permanently fixed, while our finding about proliferative state is referring to temporal state, not to the eventual cell fate.
