What are the molecular mechanisms that our brains use to store such long-term memories, and how does this information remain so stable over time? Decades after an event, few of the molecules originally present will still be around, so the mechanism that stores a memory must allow newly synthesized molecules to be updated by molecules that already \u2018contain\u2019 the memory. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Jay Groves, John Kuriyan and co-workers\u2014including Margaret Stratton and Il-Hyung Lee of the University of California Berkeley as joint first authors\u2014suggest a surprisingly simple view of how one of the leading candidates for memory storage\u2014a complex called a CaMKII holoenzyme\u2014might be updated (<a href=\"#bib8\">Stratton et al., 2014</a>)."

CaMKII is activated when the arrival of a nerve impulse at the synapse causes an increase in the concentration of calcium ions within the cell. Previous work showed that CaMKII was strongly activated during a process called \u2018long-term potentiation\u2019 that is thought to underlie learning (<a href=\"#bib3\">Lee et al., 2009</a>). This process\u2014which is induced when two nerve cells are active at the same time\u2014increases the strength of the synapse between the two nerve cells."

However, during the induction of long-term potentiation, some activated CaMKII holoenzymes are relocated from the cytoplasm to a part of the synapse called the postsynaptic density. Within this structure, the rate of dephosphorylation of T286 is very low (<a href=\"#bib6\">Mullasseril et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, should a T286 site become dephosphorylated, it is likely to be rapidly rephosphorylated by the autophosphorylation process described above. Thus, it is relatively easy to see how the \u2018on\u2019 state of CaMKII within the synapse could provide a persistent memory."

If a CaMKII holoenzyme that had been activated was later destroyed when it became old, and was replaced with newly synthesized proteins, information might be lost. But what if turnover involved the replacement of a subunit rather than the removal of an entire holoenzyme? This scenario, first proposed by Marc Goldring and myself in an early computational model of CaMKII (<a href=\"#bib4\">Lisman and Goldring, 1988</a>), has now been shown to be plausible by the work of Groves, Kuriyan and colleagues at UC Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Allosteros Therapeutics (<a href=\"#bib8\">Stratton et al., 2014</a>)."

Using optical techniques with high resolution, Stratton, Lee et al. could see single holoenzymes that contained both coloured tags\u2014proof that subunits had indeed been swapped. So if this is the way that the production and degradation of these proteins are balanced in cells, the stability of information storage during protein turnover could occur as follows: when a phosphorylated subunit in an \u2018on\u2019 holoenzyme is replaced by an unphosphorylated subunit, this new subunit is autophosphorylated by the other subunits, restoring the holoenzyme to its full \u2018on\u2019 state (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

During the induction of long-term potentiation, the concentration of calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) rises, leading to activation and autophosphorylation of CaMKII (denoted by the letter P). Some of these molecules relocate to the postsynaptic density (shaded area on right) where the phosphatase activity is very low; this means that autophosphorylation (see main text) can keep CaMKII fully phosphorylated. In the subunit exchange observed by Stratton, Lee et al., a phosphorylated subunit can be replaced by an unphosphorylated one, which is then autophosphorylated by its neighbouring subunits, returning the holoenzyme to its fully phosphorylated \u2018on\u2019 state."

Perhaps subunit exchange, followed by autophosphorylation between subunits, is as central to memory storage as the base pairing of DNA is to genetic memory. However, there are several other viable candidates for molecular memory (<a href=\"#bib2\">Kandel, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Tsien, 2013</a>). Moreover, although CaMKII has been strongly implicated in maintaining long-term potentiation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Sanhueza et al., 2011</a>), its role in maintaining memory has not been tested by looking at behaviour in animals. The gold standard for such tests is to make a memory and then determine whether this memory can be erased by an attack on the candidate memory molecule. In the mid 2000s, there was considerable excitement when another enzyme, called PKM-zeta, appeared to pass this test, but it was later shown that knocking out the gene for PKM-zeta had little effect on long-term potentiation or memory (<a href=\"#bib10\">Volk et al., 2013</a>). It will be exciting to see in years to come which of the candidate memory molecules can pass this gold standard test."
