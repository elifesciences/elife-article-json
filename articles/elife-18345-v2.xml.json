The <i>C. elegans</i> PVD sensory neuron innervates muscle-skin interface with its elaborate dendritic branches. Here, we found that LECT-2, the ortholog of leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2 (LECT2), is secreted from the muscles and required for muscle innervation by PVD. Mosaic analyses showed that LECT-2 acted locally to guide the growth of terminal branches. Ectopic expression of LECT-2 from seam cells is sufficient to redirect the PVD dendrites onto seam cells. LECT-2 functions in a multi-protein receptor-ligand complex that also contains two transmembrane ligands on the skin, SAX-7/L1CAM and MNR-1, and the neuronal transmembrane receptor DMA-1. LECT-2 greatly enhances the binding between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1. The activation of DMA-1 strictly requires all three ligands, which establishes a combinatorial code to precisely target and pattern dendritic arbors."

The <i>C. elegans</i> PVD sensory neuron innervates muscle-skin interface with its elaborate dendritic branches. Here, we found that LECT-2, the ortholog of leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2 (LECT2), is secreted from the muscles and required for muscle innervation by PVD. Mosaic analyses showed that LECT-2 acted locally to guide the growth of terminal branches. Ectopic expression of LECT-2 from seam cells is sufficient to redirect the PVD dendrites onto seam cells. LECT-2 functions in a multi-protein receptor-ligand complex that also contains two transmembrane ligands on the skin, SAX-7/L1CAM and MNR-1, and the neuronal transmembrane receptor DMA-1. LECT-2 greatly enhances the binding between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1. The activation of DMA-1 strictly requires all three ligands, which establishes a combinatorial code to precisely target and pattern dendritic arbors."

Several families of secreted proteins, such as netrin/UNC-6 and Slit, have been extensively studied for their functions as axon guidance cues (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brose et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Colamarino and Tessier-Lavigne, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hedgecock et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kennedy et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kidd et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Li et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Serafini et al., 1994</a>). Region-specific expression of these cues establishes gradients or borders that guide axonal navigation through receptor molecules on the growth cone. To date, most of the receptor-ligand interactions involve one ligand and its cognate receptor or receptor-coreceptor pair (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dickson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Huber et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yu and Bargmann, 2001</a>)."

However, the molecular nature of these mechanisms remains to be fully understood. Studies in model organisms have begun to shed light on what guides dendrites. Dendritic targeting of <i>Drosophila</i> motoneurons is regulated by midline signaling molecules, including Slit-Robo and Netrin-Fra (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brierley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mauss et al., 2009</a>). A recent study showed that homotypic interactions between the Dscam2 and Dscam4 genes are required for the precise targeting of the L4 dendrites in the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tadros et al., 2016</a>). For fly olfactory projection neurons, dendritic targeting is regulated by cell-autonomous function of graded expression of Sema-1a (<a href=\"#bib33\">Komiyama et al., 2007</a>). Interaction between integrin on the dendrite and laminin on the basement membrane restricts the two dimensional structure of dendritic arbors of <i>Drosophila</i> class IV dendritic arborization neurons and ensures dendritic self-avoidance (<a href=\"#bib22\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2012</a>)."

Indeed, the highly unusual <i>Drosophila</i> DSCAM gene generates numerous alternatively spliced variants that mediate self-avoidance of dendrites through stringent isoform-specific homophilic interactions (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hughes et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Matthews et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Soba et al., 2007</a>). Similarly, accumulating evidence suggests that the mammalian protocadherin genes can also create a large number of splice variants and mediate self-avoidance (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lefebvre et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wu and Maniatis, 1999</a>).

They first develop anterior-posteriorly oriented primary (1\u00b0) dendrites. During the larval 2 (L2) stage to L3 stage, 2\u00b0 dendrites emerge and mostly grow along the ventral-dorsal axis. When 2\u00b0 dendrites reach the border of the outer body wall muscles, they start to form T-shaped 3\u00b0 dendrites. Finally, during the L3 to L4 stage, 4\u00b0 dendrites branch out from the 3\u00b0 dendrites and grow along the ventral-dorsal axis. All the dendrites grow along the surface of the skin, or epidermis. Importantly, the numerous 4\u00b0\u00a0dendrites are sandwiched between the epidermis and body wall muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albeg et al., 2011</a>). Functional studies suggest that one of PVD\u2019s functions is to regulate body posture similar to a vertebrate proprioceptor (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albeg et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, the stringent muscle innervation by the PVD dendrites is likely to have functional importance. Previous studies showed that SAX-7/L1CAM and MNR-1/Menorin form a co-ligand complex on the epidermis to regulate the patterning of PVD dendrites (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Salzberg et al., 2013</a>).

Loss of <i>lect-2</i> severely affects the dendritic patterning in the PVD neurons. LECT-2 is mainly secreted from the muscles, and acts as both a short-range cue to guide the growth of 4\u00b0 dendrites and a long-range cue to direct the growth of 2\u00b0 and 3\u00b0 dendrites. Seam cell expressed LECT-2 causes mistargeting of PVD dendrites onto seam cells. We also found that LECT-2 directly interacts with SAX-7, and it dramatically increases the binding efficiency between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1. Together, LECT-2, SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1 form a multiprotein ligand-receptor complex. Because the activation of DMA-1 strictly requires the presence of all three ligands, the PVD dendrites receives a combinatorial code from the environment to precisely guide their morphogenesis."

We also labeled body wall muscles and seam cells using cytosolic mCherry expressed under tissue-specific promoters (<i>Pmyo-3</i>&gt;<i>mcherry</i> and <i>Pnhr-81</i>&gt;<i>mcherry</i>, respectively) as they are part of the growth environment of the PVD neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013E</a>). In wild-type animals, most of the 2\u00b0 dendrites grow perpendicularly from the 1\u00b0 dendrites and form \u2018T-shaped\u2019 3\u00b0 dendrites. PVD also elaborates orderly 4\u00b0 dendrites that are sandwiched between the epidermis and the body wall muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013E\u00a0and\u00a0I\u2013K</a>). To identify novel factors important for PVD dendrite morphogenesis, we carried out an unbiased forward genetic screen and identified two mutants, <i>wy935</i> and <i>wy953</i>, in which the patterning of PVD dendrites were severely affected in 100% of animals. Compared with wild type PVD, these mutants contained more numerous and disorganized 2\u00b0 dendrites, which completely failed to form \u2018T\u2019 shaped 3\u00b0 dendrites. In addition, no 4\u00b0 dendrites formed in these mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013K</a>). These two alleles failed to complement each other, suggesting that they affected the same gene. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping and transgene rescue experiments, we identified the causative point mutations in a novel gene <i>K05F1.5</i>, which we named <i>lect-2</i> (worm homolog of the human leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2). Both <i>wy935</i> and <i>wy953</i> contained G to A mutations, resulting in glycine to glutamic acid mutations at amino acids 259 and 103 in the LECT-2 protein, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). When placed over <i>maDf4</i> (a deficiency allele that covers the entire <i>lect-2</i> genomic locus), <i>wy935</i> showed a similar PVD dendritic morphogenesis defect to that of <i>wy935</i> homozygous animals, suggesting that <i>wy935</i> is likely to be a null allele. We also analyzed <i>ok2617</i>, a deletion allele of <i>lect-2</i>, in which a large portion of intron #2, the entirety of exon #3 and intron #3, and a small part of exon #4 are deleted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We found that <i>ok2617</i> caused an indistinguishable PVD dendritic morphogenesis defect as that of <i>wy935</i> and <i>wy953</i>, suggesting that all three alleles are likely to be nulls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The defects were fully rescued by a single copy transgene in which <i>lect-2</i> genomic DNA was driven under its endogenous promoter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>)."

When muscle expression was eliminated as shown by the lack of mCherry signal in the muscle cells, we found that the formation of 3\u00b0 dendrites were largely unaffected (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and D</a>). While the number of 2\u00b0 dendrites was still higher than the wild type controls, the 2\u00b0 dendrites in these animals were much more regular in their growth direction and they also gave rise to \u2018T\u2019 shaped 3\u00b0 dendrites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013C</a>). In contract, the growth of 4\u00b0 dendrites onto muscles was severely affected in these animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and E</a>). In two independent muscle-specific Cre strains, the number of 4\u00b0 dendrites innervating muscles was decreased by 62.1% and 74.8%, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Thus, LECT-2 from muscles is not absolutely required to pattern 2\u00b0 dendrites and 3\u00b0 dendrites, but it is required for 4\u00b0 dendrite formation."

Each muscle cell is innervated by 4\u00b0 dendrites from a single or a few adjacent menorahs (the dendritic arbor unit that consists of all the 4\u00b0 branches from the same 3\u00b0 dendrite). To further understand how muscle secreted LECT-2 promotes 4\u00b0 dendrites growth, we created another mosaic transgenic strain in which only a single muscle or a few muscles produced functional LECT-2 in the <i>lect-2</i>(<i>ok2617</i>) mutant background. The LECT-2 -expressing muscles were also labeled by mCherry. Interestingly, we found that the transgene was able to robustly restore the innervation of 4\u00b0 dendrites selectively onto <i>lect-2</i>(+) muscles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C and F</a>). On average, 11.4 dendrites were found to innervate a single <i>lect-2</i>(+) muscle (a single muscle in L4/young adult worms is roughly 100 \u00b5m) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). In striking contrast, few terminal dendrites were found growing on the <i>lect-2</i>(-) muscles (1.7 dendrites per non-transgenic muscle) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C and F</a>). On the contrary, the growth direction of 2\u00b0 dendrites and the formation of \u2018T\u2019 shaped 3\u00b0 dendrites were significantly rescued in both <i>lect-2(+)</i> and <i>lect-2(-)</i> zones (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013E</a>). These results argue strongly that muscle derived LECT-2 functions as a short ranged guidance cue to ensure that each muscle is innervated by 4\u00b0 dendrites. As the mean time, it functions as a long-range cue to pattern the 2\u00b0 and 3\u00b0 dendrites. We suspect that LECT-2 might be easily diffusible in the body cavity where 2\u00b0 and 3\u00b0 dendrites reside, but much less diffusible in the narrow space between the epidermis and body wall muscles where 4\u00b0 dendrites form. Consistent with this idea, when we over-expressed LECT-2 in <i>lect-2</i> mutants using high-copy transgenes and strong promoters from several tissues, including the PVD neurons, epidermis, body wall muscles and pharyngeal muscles, not only the patterning of 2\u00b0 dendrites and 3\u00b0 dendrites but also that of 4\u00b0 dendrites were robustly rescued in each case (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that overexpression of LECT-2 can overcome the putative diffusion barrier into the muscle-epidermis interspace and promote the\u00a04\u00b0 dendrite formation."

However, with low level of expression in the muscle cells which is more likely to mimic physiological conditions, LECT-2 appears to act locally as an instructive cue to guide 4\u00b0 dendrites to innervate each muscle. To further test if <i>lect-2</i> can function as an instructive cue to guide dendrite pattern, we sought to create an artificial expression pattern of LECT-2 and ask if the PVD dendrite follow the LECT-2 expression pattern. In the <i>lect-2</i> mutant background, we expressed LECT-2 in the seam cells, a row of epidermal cells located roughly along the primary dendrites of PVD neurons. Interestingly, <i>seam cell&gt;lect-2</i> did not rescue the branch formation defect of 4\u00b0 dendrites. Instead, it caused dendrites to grow around the seam cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Quantitatively, we observed that about 36.1% of 2\u00b0 dendrites (n\u00a0=\u00a0929) grew along the epidermal-seam cell junctions in <i>lect-2</i>(<i>ok2617</i>) mutants carrying a <i>seam cell&gt;lect-2</i> transgene, whereas only 1.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a0540) and 3.0% (n\u00a0=\u00a0518) of 2\u00b0 dendrites normally grow along the epidermal-seam cell junctions in wild-type animals and <i>lect-2</i>(<i>ok2617</i>) mutants carrying a <i>muscle&gt;lect-2</i> transgene, respectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B and F</a>).

When expressed alone in a wild-type background, YFP::LECT-2 was detected along the 3\u00b0 dendrites as well as many neuropils and commissures, which was reminiscent of the pattern of SAX-7 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). When we co-expressed LECT-2::GFP and SAX-7::mcherry under their endogenous promoters, we found the GFP and mCherry formed co-localized stripes where 3\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 dendrites grew along, suggesting that LECT-2 is recruited to SAX-7 stripes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>). Supporting this idea, the SAX-7-like staining of YFP::LECT-2 was completely abolished in <i>sax-7</i> but not <i>mnr-1</i> mutants, while the coelomocyte staining was not affected in either of mutant (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013G</a>). In addition to the normal coelomocyte staining, the transcription of <i>lect-2</i> was not obviously affected in <i>sax-7</i> mutants, suggesting that the loss of SAX-7-like staining is unlikely due to defects in the transcription, translation or secretion of LECT-2 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that SAX-7 but not MNR-1 is required to localize LECT-2 through a potentially direct link. To test if SAX-7 and LECT-2 physically interact with each other, we expressed GFP-tagged SAX-7 and HA-tagged LECT-2 in <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. The SAX-7::GFP was detected both as full length protein (SAX-7 FL) and a truncated protein product (SAX-7 CTF1). This is consistent with existing literature that SAX-7 is cleaved by a protease in its third FNIII domain (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hadwiger et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kiefel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pocock et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Salzberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sasakura et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2005</a>). Both SAX-7 FL and SAX-7 CTF1 robustly co-precipitated with LECT-2::HA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H\u2013I</a>). To further narrow down the binding region, we performed co-IP experiments using the SAX-7 extracellular domains (ECD). We generated both the naturally existing truncated SAX-7 ECD containing the last two FnIII domains, as well as a full length ECD by mutating the cleavage site. We observed robust co-precipitation of LECT-2 with both truncated protein and the full length ECD (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H,J\u2013K</a>, and <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, the last two FnIII domains of SAX-7 ECD are likely sufficient to bind to LECT-2."

In the test strain, all three transgenes were present in untagged wild-type <i>mnr-1</i> background. In one control strain, <i>dma-1::flag</i> was replaced with untagged endogenous wild-type <i>dma-1</i> locus, while the rest of the genotypes were identical to those of the test strain. In the second control strain, all three transgenes were present in a <i>mnr-1</i> null mutant background. As expected, the expression level of LECT-2::GFP and SAX-7::mCherry were comparable among the three samples (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the control sample without the <i>dma-1::flag</i>, no fluorescence signals above the background were detected, demonstrating the specificity of this assay (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013D and K</a>). In the test sample, we detected colocalized LECT-2::GFP and SAX-7::mCherry fluorescence spots, indicating that LECT-2, SAX-7 and DMA-1 likely exist in the same protein complex. The number of fluorescent spots in mCherry and GFP channels was similar, suggestive of a roughly one-to-one association between SAX-7 and LECT-2 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E\u2013G and K</a>). About 55% of LECT-2::GFP and SAX-7::mCherry signals co-localized with each other (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E\u2013G and L</a>). The incomplete colocalization in the assay arises mainly from inactive fluorophores. At single molecule level, protein fluorophores such as GFP are subject to misfolding or incomplete maturation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</a>). It was estimated that about 75% GFP molecules are fluorescently active (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jain et al., 2011</a>). Assuming this ratio, after correction of inactive fluorophores, theoretically, more than 92% LECT-2 and SAX-7 would co-localized at single molecule level. Notably, both the SAX-7 and LECT-2 signals were lost in the <i>mnr-1</i> mutant background suggesting the complex formation is dependent on endogenous MNR-1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H\u2013K</a>). Together with the previous results in the SAX-7/DMA-1/MNR-1 complex (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Salzberg et al., 2013</a>), our results suggest that LECT-2, SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1 likely exist as a single protein complex."

To study how LECT-2 acts together with SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1 to guide PVD dendritic growth, we sought to determine whether LECT-2 facilitates the formation of the receptor-ligand complex by increasing the binding efficiency between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1. First, we utilized the <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cell aggregation assay to test this idea. Consistent with our previous observation, DMA-1::RFP-expressing cells aggregated with cells co-expressing SAX-7::GFP and MNR-1::GFP after mixing and incubation in conditioned medium collected from untransfected control cells for more than 40 min, but not at earlier time points (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dong et al., 2013</a>). However, when these two groups of cells were incubated in LECT-2-containing S2 cell medium, we observed robust cell aggregate formation after only 10 min, suggesting that LECT-2 likely increased the binding efficiency between DMA-1, SAX-7 and MNR-1 (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

After cell lysis, SAX-7::HA was pulled down using biotinylated anti-HA antibody. Co-expressed DMA-1::RFP and MNR-1::GFP were directly visualized through their fused fluorescent tags. Consistent with our previous results, we found that MNR-1::GFP and DMA-1::RFP were pull-downed by SAX-7::HA without adding LECT-2::FLAG. The interactions were specific as the\u00a0very low number of MNR-1::\ufeffGFP and DMA-1::RFP were pull-downed in the control group in the absence of SAX-7::HA (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Importantly, in the presence of LECT-2::FLAG, SAX-7::HA required 40-folds less input than the sample without LECT-2 to pull down a\u00a0similar amount of MNR-1 and DMA-1 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013B</a>). The expression amount of DMA-1::RFP or MNR-1::GFP were comparable between two samples (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our result suggests that LECT-2 increases the binding efficiency between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1 by roughly 40-folds in this experimental setup. Together, our evidence strongly suggests that LECT-2 promotes the formation of the receptor-ligand complex by increasing the binding efficiency between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1."

However, the PVD dendrites do not simply follow wherever SAX-7 levels are high. For example, SAX-7 is enriched on the epidermal-seam cell junctions near the primary dendrite of the PVD neuron (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dong et al., 2013</a>), yet PVD dendrites largely ignore the SAX-7 there and extend towards the muscle cells. Thus, additional factors likely guide the PVD innervation of dendrites toward the muscles. Our results support that LECT-2 acts locally to promote the formation of the terminal branches of PVD on muscles. First, loss of <i>lect-2</i> completely abolishes the muscle targeting of PVD dendrites. Second, <i>lect-2</i> is expressed in muscles and functions as a local-acting guidance cue to guide the growth of terminal branches. Third, seam cell expressed LECT-2 fails to restore muscle targeting, but instead targets PVD dendrites onto seam cells in <i>lect-2</i> mutants."

Interestingly, overexpression of <i>lect-2</i> from several different tissues resulted in the\u00a0near complete rescue of the mutant phenotype in dendrite shape. These results argue that when overexpressed, the cellular source of <i>lect-2</i> is not critical for shaping the dendritic arbors, suggestive of a permissive function of <i>lect-2</i>. While the interpretation of these experiments should be cautioned due to overexpression, they do suggest that additional unidentified mechanisms exist to specify the muscles rather than the seam cells as the innervating targets of PVD dendrites."

It is interesting to note that the three extrinsic ligands are made by two different tissues: muscles and epidermis, and that PVD dendrite arborizes precisely between these tissues. The exclusive expression of MNR-1 by the epidermal cells ensures that PVD dendrites grow along the epidermis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Salzberg et al., 2013</a>). On the other hand, SAX-7 forms specific patterns on the epidermis to specify the location of 3\u00b0 dendrites and determine the regular spacing of 4\u00b0 dendrites (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Salzberg et al., 2013</a>). In this study, we showed that muscle secreted LECT-2 acts locally to ensure muscle innervation by the terminal branches of PVD neurons. DMA-1 acts as a coincidence detector, which is only activated when LECT-2, SAX-7 and MNR-1 are all present. This combinatorial code results in the precise targeting and patterning of PVD dendrites (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>)."

For example, <i>Drosophila</i> embryonic CNS neurons use two semaphorins to establish specific connectivity. Sema-2a acts as a repulsive cue, while Sema-2b functions as an attractive cue. Both secreted semaphorins act through the same neuronal receptor PlexB, suggesting that different axon guidance cues can converge on the same receptor (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wu et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, the same guidance cue can also elicit different responses by activating different receptors. The classic example is netrin/UNC-6, which can attract growth cones through UNC-40/DCC and repel neurons expressing UNC-5 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chan et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Colamarino and Tessier-Lavigne, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hedgecock et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kennedy et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Leonardo et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Serafini et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wadsworth et al., 1996</a>). In the above-mentioned cases, a single ligand is sufficient to bind to and activate its receptor. The integration of guidance information from multiple cues or the differential response to a single cue likely occurs downstream of guidance receptors. In contrast to these published examples, LECT-2, SAX-7 and MNR-1 converge at the level of the DMA-1 receptor and form an \u2018and\u2019 gate for the activation of the receptor. Thus, the combinatorial dendritic guidance code reported here represents a new type of mechanism to integrate diverse cues for morphogenesis decisions."

It is conceivable that the PVD dendrite\u2019s attachment to the epidermis is required for touch related functions. It is likely that the precise location of PVD dendrites between epidermis and muscle cells is essential for its function as a proprioceptive sensory neuron. Therefore, the elaborate developmental program achieves specific dendrite morphogenesis at desired locations to facilitate PVD\u2019s sensory functions. In mammals, there are many examples of precise patterning of dendritic morphogenesis in the central and peripheral nervous system, including the precise innervation of specialized peripheral sensory organs by sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheret et al., 2013</a>). Future studies are needed to determine whether a similar coding mechanism is used to achieve precise dendrite innervation in mammals. LECT2, the vertebrate homolog of LECT-2, was discovered based on its activity as a neutrophil chemotactic factor (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yamagoe et al., 1996</a>). Known neuronal guidance molecules such as Slit have been shown to regulate leukocyte chemotaxis through the CXCR4 chemokine receptor (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wu et al., 2001</a>). Hence, the acquired immune system utilized ancient molecules from the developmental nervous system to coordinate the polarization and movement of cells."

The authors performed a forward genetic screen in <i>C. elegans</i> for mutations that disrupt the precise, repetitious pattern of dendrite arborization in the body wall of this organism. The authors found two mutations in a single gene, both genetically behaving like the gene deletion, indicative of these being loss of function or null mutations. Dendrites are severely disrupted. The authors perform a formal genetic analysis, proving that the DMA2 gene is causal for the observed phenotype. DMA2 encoded the worm homologue of LECT2. Further genetic analyses implicate this gene is a previously established signaling system that includes the worm homologue of L1CAM. A strength of the paper is the magnitude and penetrance of the phenotype and the genetic analyses inclusive of rescue. More specifically, the authors show that DMA-2 is secreted from body muscle cells to promote the outgrowth of terminal (\"quaternary\") branches in a region sandwiched between muscle and overlying epidermis. A combination of biochemical and cell aggregation experiments are consistent with a model in which DMA-2 enhances the interaction of 3 additional components, SAX-7/L1, MNR-1 and DMA-1 which the authors have previously shown are required for promoting adherence of PVD dendrites to the epidermis. The results reported firmly establish DMA-2 as a new guidance molecule for PVD dendrite development. However, there are remaining concerns that should be addressed, including a more quantitative and thorough analysis of the dendritic arborization phenotype to more precisely define the nature and effects of the signal that has been identified and a more careful interpretation of the data that are being currently presented."

Although PVD quaternary branch outgrowth is selectively rescued in a <i>dma-2</i> mutant for a single DMA-2-expressing body muscle cell (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), secondary and tertiary branch outgrowth in other regions is also apparently restored. Finally, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> shows aberrant innervation of lateral seam cells with local over expression of DMA-2 but again, secondary and tertiary branch morphology is also partially rescued in this case despite the lack of DMA-2 expression in muscle. One possibility is that ectopic expression of DMA-2 in other cell types (i.e., non-muscle) may rescue secondary and tertiary branch outgrowth but not the quaternary branch defect in <i>dma-2</i> mutants. Indeed, it would be straightforward to test the idea that DMA-2 could also function as a permissive cue by expressing it in another cell type (e.g., ventral cord motor neurons).

My only substantive criticism is that the paper is written for <i>C. elegans</i> neurobiologists and less for a general reader. It would be nice to have gene names linked to the mammalian orthologues throughout the paper, and for the text to touch base, routinely with the larger literature, not just the emerging signaling system in this organism.

This result stands in contrast to the <i>dma-2</i> mutant phenotype which shows highly aberrant secondary and tertiary branch defects in addition to the absence of quaternary branches (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Perdurance seems to be an unlikely explanation since the cre driver (<i>hlh-1</i>) is expressed in embryonic muscle whereas the PVD phenotype is scored much later in development at the L4 larval stage. A similar result is also evident in a mosaic expression experiment reported in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>.

Prior studies identified 3 cell surface molecules that shapes the elaborate PVD dendritic arbors. DMA-1 functions in PVD neurons while MNR-1 and SAX-7 function in the hypodermis, and all three proteins bind to each other. Here the authors identify a fourth guidance molecule (DMA-2) that is secreted from body muscles, binds directly to the DMA-1/MNR-1/SAX-7 complex, and is also required for patterning PVD dendrites. The phenotypes of mutants lacking MNR-1, SAX-7, and DMA-2 are very similar and additive effects are not observed in double mutants. The authors provide some biochemical data suggesting that DMA-2 strengthens the binding interactions between DMA-1, SAX-7, and MNR-1. Based on these findings, the authors propose that proper PVD dendrite morphogenesis requires DMA-1 receptors to interact simultaneously with 3 distinct ligands (MNR-1/SAX-7/DMA-2), with each ligand controlling distinct aspects of dendrite growth."

In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, targeted ablation of DMA-2 expression in muscle (with a muscle-specific cre driver) significantly reduces the number of quaternary branches but secondary and tertiary branches appear largely normal. This result stands in contrast to the dma-2 mutant phenotype which shows highly aberrant secondary and tertiary branch defects in addition to the absence of quaternary branches (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Although PVD quaternary branch outgrowth is selectively rescued in a dma-2 mutant for a single DMA-2-expressing body muscle cell (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), secondary and tertiary branch outgrowth in other regions is also apparently restored. Finally, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> shows aberrant innervation of lateral seam cells with local over expression of DMA-2 but again, secondary and tertiary branch morphology is also partially rescued in this case despite the lack of DMA-2 expression in muscle. One possibility is that ectopic expression of DMA-2 in other cell types (i.e., non-muscle) may rescue secondary and tertiary branch outgrowth but not the quaternary branch defect in dma-2 mutants. Indeed, it would be straightforward to test the idea that DMA-2 could also function as a permissive cue by expressing it in another cell type (e.g., ventral cord motor neurons). Importantly, but not the only experiment that should be performed, does seam cell expressed DMA-2 rescue 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branch defects? These experiments should be conducted.</i> "

We agree that LECT-2 (named as DMA-2 in the previous version of our manuscript) functions as a long-range guidance cue for dendrite morphogenesis of the 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branches, and a short-range cue to instruct the growth of 4<sup>o</sup> dendrites in vivo. We have performed new experiments including the ones suggested by the reviewers in the revised manuscript to support these conclusions. We want to emphasize that LECT-2 acts as a co-ligand together with SAX-7 and MNR-1 for the DMA-1 receptor in both the \u201clong-range\u201d and \u201cshort-range\u201d functions. The distinction between the ranges is likely due to the different extracellular environments where the 2<sup>o</sup> /3<sup>o</sup> and 4<sup>o</sup> dendrites branches form. The 2<sup>o</sup> /3<sup>o</sup> branches form against the surface of the body cavity, through which secreted molecules diffuse easily up and down the worm body. In contrast, the 4<sup>o</sup> branches locate within the narrow space between body wall muscles and skin/epidermal cells. We suspect that endogenous LECT-2 secreted from muscles has very limited mobility in the skin-muscle interface and therefore acts as a short-range cue for the 4<sup>o</sup> branches. Below are the experiments that we added on this issue."

Compared to the <i>lect-2</i> null mutants, muscle cKO animals contained similar number of 3<sup>o</sup> dendrites, suggesting that 3<sup>o</sup> dendrite formation does not strictly rely on muscle secreted LECT-2. Interestingly, in the muscle cKO animals, the number of 2<sup>o</sup> dendrites was significantly increased (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), However, significant portion of 2<sup>o</sup> dendrites were short, misguided and did not reach the muscle border. Hence the number of 3<sup>o</sup> dendrites was not significantly different from wild type in one line and subtly increased in another (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These results suggest that the muscle secreted LECT-2 is absolutely required for 4<sup>o</sup> but not for 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> branch formation. The muscle secreted LECT-2 might have a function in reducing ectopic 2<sup>o</sup> branches. One implication of these results is that there might be other cells that express LECT-2 in addition to the body wall muscles. After carefully examining the transcriptional reporter of <i>lect-2</i>, we identified a small number of head neurons and ventral nerve cord neurons as <i>lect-2</i>-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Following the reviewers\u2019 suggestion, we now quantified the number of 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> dendrites for the <i>lect-2</i>(+) zone and <i>lect-2(-)</i> zone. We found that different from the 4<sup>o</sup> branches, the 3<sup>o</sup> branches were significantly rescued in both zones (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). The quantification of the 2<sup>o</sup> branches in these experiments were confounded by the large number of disorganized 2<sup>o</sup> branches in the <i>lect-2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). However, it is clear that the number of 2<sup>o</sup> branches that gave rise to 3<sup>o</sup> branches was dramatically increased in both the <i>lect-2</i>(+) region and nearby regions. Consistent with the cKO results, these results demonstrate that LECT-2 expressed from a single muscle cell, can function over long distance to form 2<sup>o</sup> and 3<sup>o</sup> dendrites but act locally to instruct the innervation of 4<sup>o</sup> branches to individual muscles."
