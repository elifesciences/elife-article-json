Pur-alpha-deficient mice die after birth with pleiotropic neuronal defects. Here, we report the crystal structure of the DNA-/RNA-binding domain of Pur-alpha in complex with ssDNA. It reveals base-specific recognition and offers a molecular explanation for the effect of point mutations in the 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome. Consistent with the crystal structure, biochemical and NMR data indicate that Pur-alpha binds DNA and RNA in the same way, suggesting binding modes for tri- and hexanucleotide-repeat RNAs in two neurodegenerative RNAopathies. Additionally, structure-based in vitro experiments resolved the molecular mechanism of Pur-alpha's unwindase activity. Complementing in vivo analyses in <i>Drosophila</i> demonstrated the importance of a highly conserved phenylalanine for Pur-alpha's unwinding and neuroprotective function. By uncovering the molecular mechanisms of nucleic-acid binding, this study contributes to understanding the cellular role of Pur-alpha and its implications in neurodegenerative diseases."

Pur-alpha-deficient mice die after birth with pleiotropic neuronal defects. Here, we report the crystal structure of the DNA-/RNA-binding domain of Pur-alpha in complex with ssDNA. It reveals base-specific recognition and offers a molecular explanation for the effect of point mutations in the 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome. Consistent with the crystal structure, biochemical and NMR data indicate that Pur-alpha binds DNA and RNA in the same way, suggesting binding modes for tri- and hexanucleotide-repeat RNAs in two neurodegenerative RNAopathies. Additionally, structure-based in vitro experiments resolved the molecular mechanism of Pur-alpha's unwindase activity. Complementing in vivo analyses in <i>Drosophila</i> demonstrated the importance of a highly conserved phenylalanine for Pur-alpha's unwinding and neuroprotective function. By uncovering the molecular mechanisms of nucleic-acid binding, this study contributes to understanding the cellular role of Pur-alpha and its implications in neurodegenerative diseases."

The first one contains expansions in the well-studied <i>fmr1</i> gene. Individuals with 55 to 200 CGG repeats, termed pre-mutation, develop the neurodegenerative Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hagerman et al., 2001</a>), whereas healthy individuals have less than 54 trinucleotide CGG repeats in their 5\u2019-UTR region (<a href=\"#bib35\">Oostra and Willemsen, 2009</a>). It is generally accepted that expression of <i>FMR1</i> mRNA with abnormal trinucleotide-repeat expansions are the main cause of FXTAS. The second Pur-alpha related disease is caused by repeat expansions of G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-hexanucleotides in the first intron of the <i>c9orf72</i> transcript. These repeat expansions are considered as the most common genetic abnormality in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and familial frontotemporal lobal degeneration (FTLD) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Stepto et al., 2014</a>). The diseases associated with both types of repeat expansions are accompanied by the formation of repeat RNA-containing protein inclusions (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sareen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Stepto et al., 2014</a>,; <a href=\"#bib51\">Xu et al., 2013</a>), suggesting sequestration of proteins as potential mechanism of pathology. Pur-alpha is incorporated into the inclusions of both types of disease and associates directly with the repeat RNAs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jin et al., 2007</a>,; <a href=\"#bib51\">Xu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Rossi et al., 2015</a>). In fly and mouse models, the overexpression of Pur-alpha can overcome repeat-dependent neurodegeneration of both diseases (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jin et al., 2007</a>,; <a href=\"#bib51\">Xu et al., 2013</a>), suggesting a direct contribution of Pur-alpha to neuropathology."

The expression of G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-repeat expansions cause nuclear trafficking defects, which contribute to neurotoxicity in ALS/FTLD (<a href=\"#bib9\">Freibaum et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jovicic et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Recent studies also showed that repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation occurs from CGG- as well as from G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-repeat RNAs and that the resulting proteins can form cytoplasmic aggregates, potentially contributing to pathology (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mori et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Todd et al., 2013</a>). It is likely that a combination of RNA toxicity and RAN-derived protein aggregates contribute to the full manifestation of FXTAS."

We present the co-crystal structure of Pur-alpha with a CGG trinucleotide-repeat DNA, providing a detailed structural explanation for nucleotide recognition. Pur-alpha interacts with this single-stranded DNA fragment in a sequence-specific manner with guanines and additional contacts to the phosphordiester backbone. The observed binding mode of Pur-alpha also explains its interaction with G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-hexanucleotide repeats. Mutational analyses as well as determination of the complex stoichiometry confirm that the DNA-/RNA-binding domain of Pur-alpha has two nucleic\u00a0acid-binding sites. The structure also revealed that a highly conserved phenylalanine causes disruption of the normal base stacking and leads to a strong torsion of the DNA strand, which plays a central role in Pur-alpha\u2019s dsDNA-unwinding activity. In vivo analyses of mutant proteins reveal that nucleic-acid binding and unwinding studied in vitro\u00a0are both essential for Pur-alpha\u2019s function in vivo. This information together with the crystal structure of its C-terminal dimerization domain allows us to propose a mechanism of how full-length Pur-alpha binds and unwinds dsDNA regions."

On the other hand, a previously reported double mutant R80A/R158A (R I \u2013 R II) that impairs nucleic-acid\u00a0binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Graebsch et al., 2009</a>) was still able to suppress the rCGG repeat-mediated toxicity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Thus, there might be differences in the binding for ssCGG repeats and the requirements for neuronal rescue. Most interestingly, however, is the observation that also the mutant F II, which still binds DNA/RNA but fails to unwind dsDNA, is unable to rescue neurodegeneration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Together these observations confirm the physiologic importance of the nucleic-acid-protein contacts observed in the crystal structure. In addition, these findings formally establish that the binding and unwinding of nucleic acids is required to modulate toxicity caused by pathogenic CGG RNA."

For this reason, it has been suggested that the binding of Pur-alpha to DNA is stronger than to RNA and, as a consequence, that there might be differences in the binding modes to both nucleic-acid targets. In this study, we directly compared Pur-alpha binding to RNA and DNA oligonucleotides of the same sequence and found no major differences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>). This suggests that the higher affinity for MF0677 (K<sub>D</sub> ~200 nM; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) over CGG repeats (K<sub>D</sub> ~2 \u00b5M; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) is due to differences in sequence and not the absence of the 2\u2019 OH group in the DNA. This interpretation found further support from NMR titrations with <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Pur-alpha repeat I-II and oligonucleotides. The spectra showed similar chemical shift perturbations, regardless of whether it was DNA or RNA, indicating that both nucleic acids are bound in the same way (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Finally, the crystal structure of the Pur-alpha/DNA co-complex showed that a hydroxyl-group on the 2\u2019 position of the pentose ring of the RNA sugar backbone would not cause steric clashes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C-F</a>). Together, our biochemical, NMR, and X-ray crystallographic insights indicate that Pur-alpha binds DNA and RNA in the same way and thus will interact equally with both types of nucleic acids in the cell. It is also consistent with the previously suggested Pur-alpha-dependent gene regulation by competitive RNA binding (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tretiakova et al., 1998</a>)."

However, so far, it has not been shown how unwinding is achieved on a molecular level and that this function is physiologically relevant. The crystal structure of our Pur-alpha/DNA co-complex offers a mechanistic explanation: phenylalanine in position 145 of PUR repeat II undertakes base stacking with the guanine G4 and thereby blocks the space for the neighboring cytosine C5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Thereupon, the cytosine flips out and the 3\u2019-end of the DNA strand becomes distorted. The interaction of K54 and K138 with the phosphate backbone upstream of the cytosine C5 enforces this strong turn (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). F145 is highly conserved throughout different species (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) and its mutation (F II) abolishes unwinding of dsDNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F, G</a>)."

Expression of pre-mutation CGG-repeat RNA in <i>Drosophila</i> induces neurodegeneration, which is easily detectable in abnormalities in the facet eye (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> with <a href=\"#fig5\">5B</a>). While we observed that overexpression of wild-type Pur-alpha rescues the eye phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), the RNA-binding mutant QSK I - KNR II failed to do so (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Surprisingly, a second, previously published RNA-binding mutant (Pur-alpha R I \u2013 R II), which showed strongly reduced MF0677 ssDNA binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), was able to fully rescue the eye phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). This observation indicates that arginine 80 and 158 are not required for the binding to nucleic\u00a0acids important for neuroprotection. While the neuroprotection by the R I \u2013 R II mutant indicates flexibility in nucleic-acid recognition, the loss of rescue by the QSK I - KNR II mutant formally establishes the requirement of nucleic-acid binding for Pur-alpha-dependent neuroprotection. Additionally, the F II mutation of Pur-alpha, which abolishes its dsDNA-unwinding activity, also impairs the neuroprotective function in the fly model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>).

The insertion of Pur-alpha between both DNA strands might be achieved through spontaneous breathing of the dsDNA helix (<a href=\"#bib36\">Peyrard et al., 2009</a>,; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jose et al., 2012</a>). Intercalating residues (phenylalanine, tyrosine) might cause further separation of the two DNA strands via base stacking with the guanines and thereby causing the strong twist of the DNA strands. The partly melted duplex DNA could then be further unwound by DNA helicases, which are required for initiation of transcription and replication. In the crystal structure, base pairing is observed between the 5\u2019-G1-C2 bases of two symmetry-related DNA molecules (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating, that a PUR domain would unwind a short stretch of approximately four to six bases."

Since in the crystal structure the C-terminal end of PUR repeat I-II is located on the opposite side of its nucleic-acid-binding surface (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A, B</a>, bottom), it is unlikely that PUR repeat III causes steric clashes interfering with the nucleic-acid binding by PUR repeat I-II. Hence, PUR repeat III might only facilitate dimerization, thereby guiding a second DNA-/RNA-binding domain (PUR repeat I-II) to another GGN motif further upstream or downstream on the dsDNA, where additional DNA-unwinding events could take place (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, bottom). How this effect of dimeric Pur-alpha is achieved on a molecular level and if unwinding of longer dsDNA fragments requires its joint action with helicases are main questions to be addressed in future."

A dsDNA substrate was prepared by annealing a complementary 18-mer oligonucleotide to a GGN motif of the M13mp18 ssDNA plasmid. The 18-mer was labeled with \u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P ATP. Protein dilutions were added to a constant amount of dsDNA substrate (100 ng) in binding buffer composed of 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes pH 8.0. Samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1\u2009hr. The unwinding reaction was stopped by adding SDS to a final concentration of (v/v) 0.3%. Samples were run on 9% native polyacrylamide gels in 1x TBE buffer for 150\u2009min at 200 V. Gels were incubated for 15\u2009min in fixing solution ([v/v] 10% acetic acid, [v/v] 30% methanol), dried and analyzed with radiograph films.

Both filters (nitrocellulose, top; nylon filter, bottom) were placed into a dot-blot apparatus (BioRad). Vacuum was applied and the wells were washed once with 80-\u00b5l binding buffer before and after samples were loaded. The nitrocellulose filters were analyzed using a phosphor imager system to measure the retained radiolabeled oligonucleotides on the nitrocellulose filter.

The results are included as a new table in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a> and representative binding curves of all proteins are shown in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. The observed K<sub>D</sub> values are consistent with our results from EMSA. Interestingly, mutations in PUR repeat II have stronger effects than mutations in PUR repeat I. This observation is consistent with the co-structure, in which also repeat II makes the main interactions with DNA. As shown in a previous publication (Graebsch et al. PNAS 2009), the R I \u2013 R II mutant failed to bind DNA in vitro. In summary, the quantifications provide strong support for our conclusions drawn in the initial manuscript."
