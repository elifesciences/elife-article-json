                    "text": "The signals that induce the organ of Corti and define its boundaries in the cochlea are poorly understood. We show that two Notch modifiers, <i>Lfng</i> and <i>Mfng,</i> are transiently expressed precisely at the neural boundary of the organ of Corti. Cre-Lox fate mapping shows this region gives rise to inner hair cells and their associated inner phalangeal cells. Mutation of <i>Lfng</i> and <i>Mfng</i> disrupts this boundary, producing unexpected duplications of inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells. This phenotype is mimicked by other mouse mutants or pharmacological treatments that lower but not abolish Notch signaling. However, strong disruption of Notch signaling causes a very different result, generating many ectopic hair cells at the expense of inner phalangeal cells. Our results show that Notch signaling is finely calibrated in the cochlea to produce precisely tuned levels of signaling that first set the boundary of the organ of Corti and later regulate hair cell development."

We show that two Notch modifiers, <i>Lfng</i> and <i>Mfng,</i> are transiently expressed precisely at the neural boundary of the organ of Corti. Cre-Lox fate mapping shows this region gives rise to inner hair cells and their associated inner phalangeal cells. Mutation of <i>Lfng</i> and <i>Mfng</i> disrupts this boundary, producing unexpected duplications of inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells. This phenotype is mimicked by other mouse mutants or pharmacological treatments that lower but not abolish Notch signaling. However, strong disruption of Notch signaling causes a very different result, generating many ectopic hair cells at the expense of inner phalangeal cells. Our results show that Notch signaling is finely calibrated in the cochlea to produce precisely tuned levels of signaling that first set the boundary of the organ of Corti and later regulate hair cell development."

Its sensory organ, the organ of Corti, contains mechanosensory inner and outer hair cells, surrounded by different types of supporting cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kelley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Basch et al., 2016</a>). The organ of Corti is bounded by two populations of non-sensory epithelium, the inner and outer sulci. These three domains of the cochlear duct are induced in response to a gradient of canonical BMP signaling established by the expression of BMP4 in the future outer sulcus (<a href=\"#bib64\">Ohyama et al., 2010</a>). High levels of BMP signaling promote outer sulcus differentiation, low or absent BMP signaling leads to formation of the inner sulcus, while intermediate levels of BMP signaling position the cochlear prosensory domain which will differentiate into the organ of Corti (<a href=\"#bib64\">Ohyama et al., 2010</a>). Inner hair cells, which are the first cells to differentiate in the organ of Corti, arise at the boundary of the prosensory domain and the future inner sulcus, also known as K\u00f6lliker\u2019s organ, in response to inducing signals (<a href=\"#bib26\">Groves and Fekete, 2012</a>). Recent work has identified several candidate signals that initiate hair cell development, including the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, that promote hair cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib75\">Shi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jacques et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Shi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jansson et al., 2015</a>) and other signals, such as Shh, that hold hair cell differentiation in abeyance until they are down-regulated (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bok et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Tateya et al., 2013</a>)."

The Notch signaling pathway has been implicated in the establishment of boundaries between developmental territories (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bray, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Artavanis-Tsakonas and Muskavitch, 2010</a>). For example, a zone of Notch signaling is established between the dorsal and ventral halves of the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker, 2007</a>). Here, the dorsal half of the imaginal disc expresses Notch, the glycosyltransferase enzyme Fringe and the Notch ligands Delta and Serrate, while the ventral territory expresses only Delta and Notch. Fringe proteins modify Notch receptors and ligands to increase the level of Notch signaling by Delta ligands and to attenuate Notch signaling by Serrate ligands (<a href=\"#bib70\">Rana and Haltiwanger, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">LeBon et al., 2014</a>). Accordingly, the action of Fringe in the wing imaginal disc serves to attenuate Serrate-Notch signaling in the dorsal region of the disc (<a href=\"#bib70\">Rana and Haltiwanger, 2011</a>), but permits a sharp boundary of Notch signaling at the boundary between dorsal and ventral halves in response to Serrate and Delta signals (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fortini, 2000</a>). The situation in vertebrates is complicated by the presence of multiple Delta homologues (Dll1, 3 and 4) and two Serrate homologues, Jag1 and Jag2. Current evidence suggests that Fringe modification of Notch receptors tends to <i>enhance</i> signaling by Dll1 and Dll4 ligands and <i>attenuate</i> signaling by Jag1 and Jag2 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hicks et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">LeBon et al., 2014</a>)."

Strikingly, we find these two genes are expressed transiently precisely where inner hair cells will differentiate, at the boundary between the prosensory domain and the non-sensory region of the cochlear duct known as K\u00f6lliker\u2019s organ. <i>Lfng</i> and <i>Mfng</i> expression subsequently diverge as hair cells and their surrounding supporting cells differentiate. Our observations suggest that Notch signaling may act to first position the boundary between the future organ of Corti and K\u00f6lliker\u2019s organ, and then subsequently regulate the correct formation of inner hair cells and their neighboring supporting cells. To test this, we systematically inactivated <i>Lfng</i> and <i>Mfng,</i> Notch receptors, Notch ligands, and other regulators of the Notch pathway in the developing cochlea. We find Notch signaling controls two sets of decisions at the edge of the organ of Corti. The first decision restricts the first differentiating inner hair cells and their associated supporting cells, the inner phalangeal cells, to the boundary with K\u00f6lliker\u2019s organ. We find this fate decision is regulated by Fringe activity, requires low levels of Notch signaling and is extremely sensitive to changes in signaling strength. The second decision regulates the proportion of hair cells and supporting cells through previously characterized forms of lateral inhibition (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lewis, 1991</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kiernan, 2013</a>). This fate decision does not require Fringe activity, requires higher levels of Notch signaling, and is much less sensitive to small changes in signaling strength. Our results suggest that qualitatively different forms of Notch signaling regulate different fate decisions during organ of Corti development."

At this age, the apex of the cochlea contains the most immature cells, while the base of the cochlea represents the most mature differentiating hair cells and supporting cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We observed that <i>Lfng</i> and <i>Mfng</i> transiently co-localize at the site of <i>Atoh1</i> expression at the boundary of K\u00f6lliker\u2019s organ and the prosensory domain. We confirmed this co-localization of <i>Lfng</i> and <i>Mfng</i> by performing fluorescent in situ hybridization for <i>Mfng</i> in <i>Lfng-GFP</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). As hair cell and supporting cell differentiation continues, Fringe gene expression diverges once more, with <i>Lfng</i> and Jag1 becoming restricted to supporting cells (<a href=\"#bib58\">Morsli et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Murata et al., 2006</a>), and <i>Mfng</i> being restricted to hair cells. A more complete apical-basal series of serial in situ hybridization images are shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The dynamic gene expression changes occurring along the apical-basal axis of the cochlea at E15.5 are summarized in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>."

To test this, we performed a fate mapping experiment with Lfng-CreER transgenic mice generated with the same bacterial artificial chromosome used to produce the Lfng-GFP transgenic line . We mated Lfng-CreER transgenic mice with Ai3 ROSA Cre reporter mice (<a href=\"#bib52\">Madisen et al., 2010</a>) and administered a single dose of tamoxifen at E14. Since approximately 6\u201312 hr typically elapse between tamoxifen administration and the onset of recombination (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cai et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gridley and Groves, 2014</a>), this time point allows us to map the fate of Lfng-expressing cells in the apical and middle regions of the cochlea that we observe at the prosensory domain border. Mice were sacrificed four days later at E18.5, and sections and whole mounts of the cochlea were stained for the presence of hair cells, pillar cells and the EGFP reporter. In the most apical regions of the cochlea, we observed most EGFP-labeled cells in K\u00f6lliker\u2019s organ and very few in the inner hair cell region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with the expression of Lfng in this region between E12 and E14 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Morsli et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ohyama et al., 2010</a>). In middle turn regions of the cochlea, we saw many EGFP-labeled inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In many cases, labeled inner hair cells were found adjacent to labeled inner phalangeal cells in whole mounts and sections. However, we observed very little labeling of other organ of Corti cell types in apical or middle turn regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), suggesting that the strongly Lfng-expressing cells we observed at the border of the prosensory domain at E14-15 are progenitors of both inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells. In basal regions of the cochlea, we now observed many labeled Deiters\u2019 cells, some labeled inner pillar cells as well as labeled inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). These results are consistent with the onset of expression of Lfng in all supporting cell types except outer pillar cells in the basal region of the cochlea at E15.5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We also occasionally saw labeled outer hair cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), suggesting that some Deiters\u2019 cell progenitors may differentiate into hair cells as Notch-mediated lateral inhibition establishes the precise pattern of hair cells and supporting cells in the organ of Corti. The transition from middle to basal turns of the cochlear duct was characterized by a gradual spreading of EGFP labeling into the Deiters\u2019 cell and outer hair cell region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Since Fringe proteins act to modify Notch receptors and ligands to change their signaling properties (<a href=\"#bib70\">Rana and Haltiwanger, 2011</a>), we examined the expression of supporting cell markers in our mutants. Surprisingly, we continued to observe p27<sup>kip1</sup>-expressing supporting cells lying beneath the supernumerary inner hair cells, which is not predicted by a classical lateral inhibition model (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To identify the type of supporting cells beneath the inner hair cells, we used antibodies to the glutamate/aspartate transporter GLAST encoded by the <i>Slc1a3</i> gene and a nervous system-specific fatty acid binding protein, FABP7, both of which label inner phalangeal cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Furness and Lehre, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Saino-Saito et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Zilberstein et al., 2012</a>). We found both markers continued to be expressed in <i>Lfng;Mfng</i> mutants, and that supernumerary inner phalangeal cells were found adjacent to supernumerary inner hair cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Thus, in the absence of Fringe activity, both inner hair cells <i>and</i> their associated inner phalangeal cells were duplicated at the boundary of K\u00f6lliker\u2019s organ and the prosensory domain. This suggests that the defects we observe in these mutant mice do not result from a failure of Notch-mediated lateral inhibition that has been previously demonstrated to distinguish between hair cells and supporting cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kiernan, 2013</a>). Instead, it appears that the column of inner hair cell and inner phalangeal cell progenitors that transiently express <i>Lfng</i> and <i>Mfng</i> normally inhibit their neighbors in K\u00f6lliker\u2019s organ from also adopting an inner hair cell/inner phalangeal cell fate."

Differentiating hair cells express three Notch ligands, Dll1, Dll3 and Jag2 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lanford et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Morrison et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hartman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Maass et al., 2015</a>), of which Dll1 and Jag2 act as conventional Notch ligands, whereas Dll3 appears to act only by inhibiting Notch receptors in the same cell (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ladi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Geffers et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chapman et al., 2011</a>). To determine whether the loss of Fringe proteins led to a reduction in Notch signaling delivered by differentiating hair cells, we compared the <i>Lfng;Mfng</i> phenotype to the cochlear phenotype seen in <i>Jag2</i> mutants. <i>Jag2</i> mutant mice display supernumerary inner hair cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lanford et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Zhang et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), and we also observed supernumerary inner phalangeal cells in these mice on the basis of p27<sup>kip1</sup>, GLAST and FABP7 immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

To do this, we examined two mouse mutants that displayed a partial loss of Notch signaling in the cochlea. Pofut1 is an O-fucosyltransferase that adds fucose moieties to Notch receptors and ligands (<a href=\"#bib82\">Takeuchi and Haltiwanger, 2010</a>), and whose activity generates the O-fucose substrate that is necessary for further N-glycosylation of Notch receptors by Fringe proteins (<a href=\"#bib78\">Shi and Stanley, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Shi et al., 2005</a>). <i>Pofut1</i> null mutant mice die between E9.5 and E10.5 with an axial phenotype reminiscent of a Notch loss of function (<a href=\"#bib78\">Shi and Stanley, 2003</a>), although different tissues can display differential sensitivities to loss of <i>Pofut1</i> (<a href=\"#bib74\">Schuster-Gossler et al., 2009</a>). Conditional deletion of <i>Pofut1</i> in the cochlea with <i>Pax2-Cre</i> transgenic mice leads to a reduction, but not a complete loss of Notch signaling, as revealed by the presence of cleaved Notch1-intracellular protein in the nuclei of <i>Pofut1</i> mutant supporting cells and the enhancement of the <i>Pofut1</i> mutant phenotype by additional Notch inhibition with gamma secretase inhibitors in organ culture (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). This incomplete loss of Notch signaling suggests that at least some Notch receptors lacking O-fucose glycans can still be chaperoned to the surface of progenitor cells in the <i>Pofut1</i> mutant cochlea. <i>Pofut1</i> conditional mutant mice also exhibited both supernumerary inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), suggesting that this phenotype can be caused by a general reduction in Notch signaling. To confirm this, we also examined transgenic mice carrying a Cre-inducible dominant-negative form of MAML1, a nuclear co-factor responsible for the formation of transcriptional complexes between the Notch intracellular domain and the RBPJ co-factor (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kovall, 2008</a>). Embryos derived by mating <i>Pax2-Cre</i> and Cre-inducible <i>dnMAML1</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib86\">Tu et al., 2005</a>) also showed only a partial Notch loss of function (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) and displayed both supernumerary inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We found that <i>Lfng;Mfng</i> mutants, <i>Jag2</i> mutants, <i>Pofut1</i> conditional mutants and <i>dMAML1</i> mutants all showed a significant increase in inner hair cells and the presence of extra inner phalangeal cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>), but we only observed an increase in outer hair cells in <i>Jag2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lanford et al., 1999</a>)."

However, the persistence of inner phalangeal cells in our mutant lines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">3A</a>) suggest that Notch-mediated lateral inhibition between hair cells and supporting cells still occurs in our various mouse models when Notch signaling is reduced but not abolished. To test this, we examined <i>Notch1</i> conditional null mutant mice which have been shown to produce a significant loss of lateral inhibition between hair cells and supporting cells in the cochlea (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kiernan et al., 2005</a>). As expected, we observed a very large increase in both inner and outer hair cells, and a great reduction of many kinds of supporting cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Significantly, we saw no evidence for inner phalangeal cells in Notch1 conditional mutants on the basis of p27<sup>kip1</sup>, GLAST or FABP7 staining (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), suggesting that the cochlear phenotype caused by a strong Notch loss of function is due to a combination of an increase in inner hair / inner phalangeal progenitor specification and the subsequent differentiation of these ectopic progenitors exclusively into inner hair cells."

Indeed, previous studies have observed a small amount of prolonged proliferation of cochlear progenitors in Notch pathway mutants (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kiernan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Murata et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Tateya et al., 2011</a>).

We used double transgenic mice carrying a <i>GLAST-dsRed</i> transgene (<a href=\"#bib71\">Regan et al., 2007</a>) to label inner phalangeal cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and <i>Atoh1-GFP</i> reporter mice (<a href=\"#bib79\">Shroyer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cai et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2015</a>). We isolated cochleas from E14.5 double transgenic mice and cultured them for three days in the presence of different doses of the gamma secretase inhibitor DAPT or Notch1 blocking antibodies (<a href=\"#bib91\">Wu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Maass et al., 2015</a>). We demonstrated the differential degree of Notch inhibition by measuring levels of Notch-responsive <i>Hes</i> and <i>Hey</i> genes in our cultures. We observed a modest down-regulation of <i>Hes1</i> and <i>Hes5</i> at intermediate doses of DAPT or anti-Notch1 antibodies, but no significant down-regulation of <i>Hey1, Hey2</i> or <i>Heyl</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,E</a>). However, at high concentrations of either inhibitor, all genes were significantly down-regulated with the exception of <i>Hey2</i>, which is much less sensitive to changes in Notch signaling in the cochlea (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doetzlhofer et al., 2009</a>). At high concentrations of either inhibitor, we observed significant increases in both outer and inner hair cells, and a loss of inner phalangeal cells as revealed by the absence of GLAST-dsRed fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D</a>). This result is consistent with a loss of lateral inhibition between hair cells and supporting cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kiernan, 2013</a>). In contrast, when we applied 100-fold lower concentrations of Notch1 antibody or 25-fold lower doses of DAPT to the cultures, we saw a smaller but still significant increase in the number of inner hair cells, but no significant increase in outer hair cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,F</a>). Moreover, we continued to observe expression of the <i>GLAST-dsRed</i> transgene at these doses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D</a>), suggesting that inner phalangeal cells do not trans-differentiate into hair cells, but remain adjacent to the supernumerary inner hair cells."

It was first proposed to regulate the production of cochleo-vestibular ganglion neurons, and later of hair cells and supporting cells by lateral inhibition (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lewis, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Haddon et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lewis 1998</a>). Notch signaling can also regulate the production of sensory patches though inductive signaling between Jag1 and Notch, leading to the up-regulation of Sox2 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eddison et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hartman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Pan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Neves et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Pan et al., 2013</a>). In this study, we identify a new and unexpected role for Notch signaling in the ear: the positioning of inner hair cells and their associated inner phalangeal cells at the boundary of K\u00f6lliker\u2019s organ and the prosensory domain. We show that this developmental decision is exquisitely sensitive to changes in Notch signaling. We observed a striking duplication of both inner hair cells <i>and</i> inner phalangeal cells in five different mutant mouse models and two organ culture systems that lower, but do not eliminate, Notch signaling in the cochlea. Unlike previous studies of Notch signaling in the cochlea, these phenotypes do not resemble defects in Notch-mediated lateral inhibition that is known to occur between hair cells and supporting cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kiernan, 2013</a>). Only in conditions where Notch signaling is greatly reduced - such as in <i>Notch1</i> mutants or at high doses of Notch blocking antibodies or gamma secretase inhibitors \u2013 do we see a conversion of duplicated inner phalangeal cells into inner hair cells, suggestive of a failure of lateral inhibition between hair cells and supporting cells. Our data, together with the careful analysis of Notch1 activation in the developing cochlea performed by Murata and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib61\">Murata et al., 2006</a>) lead us to propose a new model for the development of the organ of Corti that involves two phases of Notch signaling. Because hair cell differentiation proceeds in a basal-apical direction over a period of several days (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cai et al., 2013</a>), we discuss the timing of these events with respect to the basal region of the cochlea (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

Our EdU labeling comparisons between wild type, <i>Pofut1</i> and dnMAML1 mutant mice showed no significant increase in labeling of inner phalangeal cells, inner hair cells or any other organ of Corti cell type. A previous study described significant increases in proliferation in the progenitors of pillar cells, Deiters\u2019 cells and Hensen\u2019s cells in <i>Dll1<sup>+/\u2212</sup>;Jag2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> and <i>Dll1<sup>hyp/\u2212</sup>;Jag2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mutant embryos, but not single mutants for either ligand (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kiernan et al., 2005</a>). We infer from this that the reduction in Notch signaling in all our Notch pathway mutants (with the exception of <i>Notch1</i> conditional mutants) is insufficient to trigger aberrant proliferation, and that our phenotype is due solely to a disruption in the boundary between the prosensory domain and K\u00f6lliker\u2019s organ."

                        "text": "It is now well established that the strength of Notch signaling in vertebrates can vary according to both the identity and post-translational modification of the activated Notch receptor and the identity of the activating ligand (for example, <a href=\"#bib66\">Ong et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Yamamoto et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Van de Walle et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">LeBon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Petrovic et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gama-Norton et al., 2015</a>). The developing organ of Corti is an excellent system to study the strength of Notch signaling, as its stereotyped pattern of hair cells and different supporting cell types allows extremely small irregularities in cell numbers to be detected easily. Our data provide an example of how rapid dynamic changes in both Notch ligands (Jag1, Jag2, and Dll1) and regulatory Fringe proteins at the boundary of the organ of Corti can quickly transition between Notch signaling states that set the boundary (moderate Notch signaling; regulated by Fringe proteins) and then distinguish between hair cells and supporting cells (high Notch signaling; no requirement for Fringe proteins). Moreover, our observation that the early phase of Notch signaling is extremely sensitive to changes in signaling strength suggests that the Hes or Hey genes activated in this phase will have mostly low-affinity binding sites for the Rbpj transcriptional activator in their promoters. Indeed, low levels of Notch activation and Hes/Hey gene expression are observed at this boundary (<a href=\"#bib61\">Murata et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Basch et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Tateya et al., 2011</a>) and <i>Hes5</i>, whose promoter contains low-affinity Rbpj binding sites (<a href=\"#bib66\">Ong et al., 2006</a>), is up-regulated at the boundary of K\u00f6lliker\u2019s organ as hair cells differentiate (<a href=\"#bib85\">Tateya et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, <i>Hes5</i> mutant mice develop supernumerary inner hair cells and supporting cells at the onset of hair cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib97\">Zine et al., 2001</a>)."

                        "text": "Our results provide additional evidence for the notion that organ of Corti development is an iterative process proceeding in the neural-abneural direction, with inner hair cells and their associated supporting cells differentiating first, which then release inducing signals such as Fgf8 that then drive the differentiation of the adjacent cells into pillar cells. It is likely that these short-range signals interact with and modify other patterning signals in the cochlear duct, such as FGF10 and FGF20 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Urness et al., 2015</a>), although signals that promote specific cell fates in the outer hair cell region, such as outer hair cells and Deiters\u2019 cells, remain to be identified. We do not know the nature of signals that limit the size of the organ of Corti on the abneural side of the cochlear duct, but given the proximity of a strong source of BMP4 in the future outer sulcus (<a href=\"#bib58\">Morsli et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ohyama et al., 2010</a>), it is likely that this factor may play a role. Nevertheless, our data reveal how the deployment of the Notch pathway-modifying enzymes Lfng and Mfng at the boundary of the future organ of Corti modulate levels of Notch signaling to restrict hair cell-inducing signals to a precise location at this boundary. Since Lfng and Mfng expression subsequently diverge, with Mfng restricted to hair cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cai et al., 2015</a>) and Lfng restricted to supporting cells (<a href=\"#bib94\">Zhang et al., 2000</a>), it will be of interest to determine whether these enzymes continue to play any role in modulating Notch signaling in the mature organ of Corti."

Notch signalling is known to pattern the organ of Corti, and Fringe proteins are also known for their role in fine-tuning Notch signalling in other systems. The new finding here is that regulation of Notch signalling by Fringe plays a role in the generation of inner hair cells and their associated supporting cells, the inner phalangeal cells, in the cochlear duct. A surprising result is that a partial loss of Notch signalling results in both supernumerary hair cells and supernumerary supporting cells. This differs from the classical model for lateral inhibition in the developing cochlea, where a disruption of Notch signalling is predicted to result in supernumerary hair cells at the expense of supporting cells. The data are clear and well-presented, with careful and appropriate quantitation, use of controls and statistical analysis."

If the sentence refers to the neighbouring cells, the 'these' is ambiguous, and the sentence does not follow logically from the previous one.

The experiments are extremely careful and beautifully presented, and there is no doubt about the consistency of the various phenotypes and treatments. Data are of high quality and involve a variety of approaches including lineage tracing, phenotypic analysis, organ culture, etc., all making it a robust piece of work.

This manuscript by Basch et al., proposes a novel form of Notch signaling that sets up the boundary of the initial row of inner hair cells, in which Fringe proteins, modulators of Notch signaling, are an essential component. The authors show that Lfng and Mng are initially precisely positioned at the location of the first inner hair cell row. In their absence, multiple rows form, along with a duplication of supporting cells. By comparing the results of minor reductions in Notch signaling to more robust loss of Notch, the authors suggest that establishment of the initial row of hair cells is inherently different in that it requires lower levels of Notch signaling, and is therefore more susceptible to mild reductions in Notch signaling. Overall the data is well-performed and presented, and the authors analyze quite a number of different Notch mutants to determine differences. The authors put forward an interesting hypothesis as to why the hair cell genesis is initially restricted to a single row. However, it is not clearly established that a lower level of Notch signaling is required for boundary formation \u2013 while milder defects in Notch signaling may first lead to an expansion of the sensory domain, it may be that the non-sensory regions (or supporting cells outside the hair cell regions) are simply more sensitive to loss of Notch signaling, and thus boundary formation is lost first."

However, in this case the prediction would be that deleting both fringes would lead to higher levels of Notch, as cis-inhibition would be largely relieved. However, this does not seem to be the case, as new hair cells develop, suggesting Notch activity is reduced in their absence. Since the model indicates that moderate levels of Notch activity are important for setting up this boundary, it would be important to show directly how levels of Notch are regulated at the boundary."

Although this has been shown to occur in vitro, there is very little published data on the biological relevance of these modifications, and what data there is suggests that Fringe modification of the ligands is not necessary for their function. The second mechanism is the regulation of cis-inhibition by Fringe proteins between Notch receptors and ligands in the same cell, which reduces the activity of both receptor and ligand. The best evidence for cis-inhibition and the role of Fringe proteins in this mechanism comes from <i>Drosophila</i> genetics and cell line studies rather than from in vivo vertebrate studies, but the phenomenon is nevertheless well accepted in the literature."

Thus, neurons deploy Notch ligands to inhibit neural progenitors from adopting a neuronal fate, hair cells deploy Notch ligands to inhibit supporting cells from adopting a hair cell fate and so forth. Cis-inhibition, on the other hand, is a <i>protein-protein interaction</i> that occurs when a Notch receptor and a ligand are expressed in the same cell and interact with each other. This interaction reduces the amount of free receptor and ligand in the cell, thus lowering the ability of the cell to both send and receive Notch signals. The amount of cis-inhibition that occurs between receptors and ligands in a cell can be regulated by Fringe: Fringe enhances the interaction between \u0394 and Notch in the same cell (and thus increases cis-inhibition), but decreases the interaction between Jag1/2 and Notch in the same cell (and thus decreases cis-inhibition)."
