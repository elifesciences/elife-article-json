In response to certain stress conditions, many mRNA decay factors are enriched in processing bodies (PBs), cellular structures involved in degradation and/or storage of mRNAs. Yet, how cells regulate assembly and disassembly of PBs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in budding yeast, mutations in the DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1 that prevent ATP hydrolysis, or that affect the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1, the central scaffold of the CCR4-NOT complex and an activator of the Dhh1 ATPase, prevent PB disassembly <i>in vivo</i>. Intriguingly, this process can be recapitulated <i>in vitro</i>, since recombinant Dhh1 and RNA, in the presence of ATP, phase-separate into liquid droplets that rapidly dissolve upon addition of Not1. Our results identify the ATPase activity of Dhh1 as a critical regulator of PB formation."

In response to certain stress conditions, many mRNA decay factors are enriched in processing bodies (PBs), cellular structures involved in degradation and/or storage of mRNAs. Yet, how cells regulate assembly and disassembly of PBs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in budding yeast, mutations in the DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1 that prevent ATP hydrolysis, or that affect the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1, the central scaffold of the CCR4-NOT complex and an activator of the Dhh1 ATPase, prevent PB disassembly <i>in vivo</i>. Intriguingly, this process can be recapitulated <i>in vitro</i>, since recombinant Dhh1 and RNA, in the presence of ATP, phase-separate into liquid droplets that rapidly dissolve upon addition of Not1. Our results identify the ATPase activity of Dhh1 as a critical regulator of PB formation."

Mutant Dhh1 proteins that lack ATPase activity form permanent processing bodies in non-stressed yeast cells.

Given their impact on both translation and mRNA decay, the status of the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of the mRNA, as well as the complement of proteins that bind the mRNA termini, are tightly controlled. In budding yeast, a key event for the entry of mRNAs into the degradation pathway is the removal of the polyA tail (<a href=\"#bib49\">Muhlrad and Parker, 1992</a>), which is predominantly accomplished by the CCR4-NOT complex (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wiederhold and Passmore, 2010</a>).

PBs are dynamic, membrane-less structures that appear to form from multivalent interactions between proteins and RNA in a liquid-liquid phase separation phenomenon (<a href=\"#bib18\">Decker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fromm et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Guo and Shorter, 2015</a>). Remarkably, PBs and several other related types of mRNP granules, including stress granules, germ granules, and neuronal transport granules, form in a number of different species and cell types, and in a variety of different biological contexts, suggesting these structures are important for cellular function (<a href=\"#bib20\">Erickson and Lykke-Andersen, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kiebler and Bassell, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Voronina, 2013</a>).

For example, cells unable to form PBs show a severe loss in viability in stationary phase (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ramachandran et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Shah et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, ectopic expression of highly expressed mRNAs in cells that cannot form PBs is toxic (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lavut and Raveh, 2012</a>).

Similar to other DEAD-box proteins, Dhh1 possesses N- and C-terminal RecA-like domains connected by a short linker, and can bind RNA with high affinity in a sequence-independent manner through the phosphate backbone (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cheng et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Russell et al., 2013</a>). <i>In vitro</i>, Dhh1 has a significantly lower ATPase activity than other well characterized DEAD-box proteins such as eIF4A or Ded1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cordin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dutta et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pause and Sonenberg, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tritschler et al., 2009</a>).

Therefore, it is unclear whether PB formation in cells expressing <i>dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup></i> is caused by a loss or gain of Dhh1 function. If Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> PB formation is caused by a loss of Dhh1 function, then the presence of a wild-type copy of <i>DHH1</i> should abolish constitutive granule formation. To test this, we expressed wild-type Dhh1-GFP and Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>-GFP in either <i>DHH1</i> or <i>dhh1\u2206</i> cells in glucose-rich conditions and observed the localization of Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>-GFP\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

In order to directly interrogate whether loss of the\u00a0ATPase activity of Dhh1 disrupted mRNA turnover, we tested the functionality of Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> in mRNA decay using a previously established tether-based functional assay. We and others have observed that tethering Dhh1 to a reporter mRNA using the bacteriophage PP7 or MS2 systems is sufficient to stimulate the\u00a0decay of a\u00a0tethered mRNA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carroll et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sweet et al., 2012</a>). We expressed wild-type Dhh1, Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>, or GFP as a PP7 coat protein (PP7CP) fusion protein in <i>dhh1\u2206</i> cells containing a single stem loop (PP7L) engineered into the 3\u2019UTR of the <i>FBA1</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and assessed steady state mRNA levels by qPCR. As expected, tethering Dhh1-PP7CP to <i>FBA1</i> mRNA caused an 80% reduction of <i>FBA1</i> mRNA levels compared with GFP-tethered mRNA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carroll et al., 2011</a>). In comparison, tethering Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> showed a partial attenuation of mRNA decay, with <i>FBA1</i> levels decreasing by 55%, (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carroll et al., 2011</a>), indicating that Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> is capable of stimulating mRNA decay."

Therefore, we performed single molecule mRNA fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (smFISH) to examine if Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> PBs show hallmarks of mRNA decay. Log-phase <i>DHH1, dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup></i>, and <i>xrn1\u2206</i> cells were shifted into glucose starvation media, and the mRNA localization of <i>FBA1</i>, an essential glycolytic\u00a0gene, was analyzed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In <i>xrn1\u2206</i> cells, 54% of <i>FBA1</i> mRNAs colocalized with a Dcp2-GFP PB marker in cells grown in glucose-rich conditions and this colocalization was further increased to 75% following glucose starvation. In contrast, only 11% of <i>FBA1</i> mRNAs colocalized with PB foci in glucose-starved cells expressing wild-type <i>DHH1</i>, consistent with the notion that PBs are sites of mRNA decay, rather than mRNA storage. In cells expressing <i>dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup></i>, <i>FBA1</i> mRNA showed a modest overlap with Dcp2-GFP \u2013 around 20% in glucose-rich conditions, and 22% following glucose starvation. Similar results were obtained in smFISH experiments with mRNAs coding for <i>GFA1</i>, which functions in chitin biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lagorce et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), <i>PAT1</i>, which is involved in mRNA decapping (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bonnerot et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and the phosphoglycerate kinase <i>PGK1</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hitzeman et al., 1980</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) in <i>DHH1</i>, <i>dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup></i>, and <i>xrn1\u2206</i> cells. Our tethering experiments, together with the difference in mRNA accumulation between Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> PBs and PBs\u00a0in\u00a0<i>xrn1\u2206</i> cells,\u00a0suggest that Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> PB formation is likely not due to a complete failure to degrade mRNAs. However, some mRNAs show slower turnover in the presence of Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carroll et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, reduced decay kinetics may cause mRNAs to persist for longer in PBs, which may in part contribute to the formation of Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> PBs in the absence of stress."

Given that ATP-bound Dhh1 binds mRNA in a sequence-independent manner with nanomolar affinity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dutta et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ernoult-Lange et al., 2012</a>), one plausible model is that Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> binds to mRNA, but is unable to dissociate from it in the absence of ATP hydrolysis, ultimately leading to constitutive PB formation. To test this possibility, we generated an RNA binding mutant of Dhh1, Dhh1<sup>3X-RNA</sup>, with alanine substitutions at three residues in the C-terminal RecA domain that are important for RNA binding (R322A, S340A, R370A) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dutta et al., 2011</a>). Wild-type Dhh1, Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>, Dhh1<sup>3X-RNA</sup>, and a Dhh1<sup>DQAD/3X-RNA</sup>-GFP double mutant were co-expressed with Dcp2-mCherry in glucose-rich conditions and PB formation was monitored. While Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> cells formed PBs as expected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, left panel), combining ATPase-dead and RNA-binding mutations in <i>cis</i> in the Dhh1<sup>DQAD/3X-RNA</sup> mutant abolished constitutive PB formation. In addition, both Dhh1<sup>3X-RNA</sup> and Dhh1<sup>DQAD/3X-RNA</sup> mutants showed a strong reduction of PB formation in glucose starvation conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, right panel). In addition, several other PB components showed strong defects in PB localization in cells expressing <i>dhh1<sup>3X-RNA</sup></i> (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Notably, all Dhh1 mutant proteins were expressed to similar levels in these experiments (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Next, we examined whether disruptions in RNA binding by Dhh1 also affected Dhh1 function in mRNA decay using our tethering assay (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Dhh1<sup>3X-RNA</sup> caused only a ~30% reduction in tethered <i>FBA1</i> mRNA levels, demonstrating that disruption of the mRNA decay activity of Dhh1 per se\u00a0is not sufficient to trigger PB formation. Overall, we conclude that Dhh1 in its ATP-bound state promotes PB formation and that PB assembly requires RNA binding by Dhh1."

To carefully assess the effects of the deletion of <i>DHH1</i> on PB formation, we utilized the Diatrack particle tracking software (<a href=\"#bib71\">Vallotton and Olivier, 2013</a>) which allows for an unbiased, automated, and accurate quantitation of foci formation (see Materials and methods). Analysis of greater than 1000 cells per experiment revealed a\u00a0nearly 80% reduction of the\u00a0Dcp2-mCherry foci number per cell in <i>dhh1\u2206</i> compared to wild-type cells during glucose starvation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

To address this question, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Cells expressing either wild-type Dhh1 or Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> were shifted to glucose-free media to allow PBs to form, and the recovery of GFP-tagged mRNA decay factors within photobleached PBs was measured over time. Consistent with our previous work, Dhh1-GFP PB fluorescence recovered to roughly 80% within 1 min, while the Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>-GFP signal did not, suggesting that\u00a0Dhh1 ATP hydrolysis is required for Dhh1 to shuttle in and out of PBs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carroll et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, the dynamics of several mRNA decay factors, namely Dcp1, Dcp2, Edc3, and Xrn1, remained unchanged in cells expressing Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> compared with Dhh1. The mRNA decay factors observed showed two distinct FRAP profiles: Xrn1-GFP showed dynamic PB localization in <i>DHH1</i> and <i>dhh1<sup>DQAD\u00a0</sup></i>cells, while Dcp1, Dcp2, and Edc3 showed a static PB localization profile. The limited recovery seen for Dcp1 and Dcp2 is in agreement with previous FRAP measurements in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aizer et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2014</a>), and indicates that these factors are likely resident PB proteins. Thus, with the exception of Dhh1 itself, the dynamics of all tested PB components were not significantly altered by the loss of Dhh1\u2019s ATPase activity."

To examine the dynamicity of these granules over a longer period, we also treated cells with cycloheximide, which disrupts PB formation, likely by trapping mRNAs on polysomes and preventing their entry into PBs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kroschwald et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Teixeira et al., 2005</a>). Cells expressing either Dhh1-GFP or Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>-GFP and Dcp2-mCherry were grown to mid-log phase and shifted to glucose-free media for 30 min to allow PBs to form, and then treated with cycloheximide for up to 2\u2009hr and PB disassembly was monitored over time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). While Dhh1-GFP showed roughly 60% disassembly of PBs after 20 min following cycloheximide treatment versus no treatment or solvent-only (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"#media2\">2</a> ), Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> PB disassembly occurred significantly slower, with 60% disassembly occurring around 80 min after cycloheximide treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">4</a>). Notably, 2\u00a0hr cycloheximide treatment did not adversely affect cell viability (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The disassembly of Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> PBs following cycloheximide treatment suggests that these structures, like wild-type PBs, are RNA-dependent structures. However, the slower disassembly kinetics of Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> PBs, coupled with the dampened recycling of Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>, indicates that ATPase activity of Dhh1 is critical for normal PB disassembly, for instance, by facilitating release of Dhh1 from its mRNA client."

                                "text": "So far, our data reveal that the ATPase cycle of Dhh1 is a critical regulator of PB dynamics, and that Dhh1 in its ATP-bound state promotes PB formation. Interestingly, Dhh1 alone is a very poor ATPase <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dutta et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tritschler et al., 2009</a>). However, DDX6, the mammalian homolog of Dhh1, can be stimulated by CNOT1, the central scaffold subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mathys et al., 2014</a>). Based on our data, we would therefore predict that Not1 should promote the disassembly of PBs by stimulating the ATPase cycle of Dhh1. To test this prediction, we first examined whether <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Not1, like its mammalian homolog, stimulated\u00a0the\u00a0ATPase activity of Dhh1 <i>in vitro</i>. We recombinantly expressed and purified full-length Dhh1 and Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> and performed\u00a0<i>in vitro</i> ATPase assays to assess\u00a0the enzymatic activity of Dhh1 in the presence or absence of polyU RNA and recombinant Not1<sup>MIF4G</sup> (amino acids 754\u20131000). Similar to previous observations, we could not detect an intrinsic ATPase activity for Dhh1 alone. Dhh1 was weakly stimulated by polyU RNA (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dutta et al., 2011</a>), whereas addition of Not1<sup>MIF4G</sup> alone had little effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, addition of polyU RNA and increasing concentrations of Not1<sup>MIF4G</sup> robustly stimulated the ATPase activity of Dhh1, but not Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast, Gle1, another MIF4G-fold protein that stimulates the activity of Dbp5, a related DEAD-box ATPase that functions in mRNA export (<a href=\"#bib48\">Montpetit et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Snay-Hodge et al., 1998</a>), had no effect on Dhh1 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Furthermore, Not1 was unable to stimulate the catalytic activity of Dbp5 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), demonstrating that Not1 specifically activates the ATPase cycle of Dhh1 <i>in vitro</i>."

To interfere with the\u00a0Dhh1-Not1 interaction, we generated a mutant with amino acid substitutions in conserved residues on three distinct surfaces of Dhh1 (Dhh1<sup>R55E, F62E, Q282E, N284E, R355E</sup>, henceforth Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup>) that are predicted to affect binding to Not1, based on previous structural data (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mathys et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> showed a marked reduction in Not1 binding in immunoprecipitation experiments\u00a0compared with wild-type Dhh1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating that these amino acid residues are important for the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1. Given that ATP binding by Dhh1 is likely a prerequisite for PB formation, we also examined whether ATP binding by Dhh1 was needed for the interaction with Not1. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, Dhh1<sup>Q-motif</sup> was defective in Not1 binding, suggesting that ATP-bound Dhh1 is needed for robust interaction with Not1."

Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> triggered Dhh1 and Dcp2 colocalization in cytoplasmic granules in glucose-rich conditions, similar to catalytically dead Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).\u00a0All Dhh1 mutant proteins were expressed to similar levels in these experiments (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Two lines of evidence suggest that these granules are indeed <i>bona fide</i> PBs. First, Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> granules contained several other known PB proteins \u2013 including Xrn1, Dcp1, and Edc3 \u2013 in both glucose-rich and glucose starvation conditions (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>). Second, Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> granule assembly required robust RNA binding activity, as a Dhh1<sup>5X-Not/3X-RNA</sup> mutant showed a dramatic defect in PB formation in both glucose-rich and glucose starvation conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Of note, the Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> mutant did not show a defect in mRNA decay using our tethering assay (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), suggesting that PB formation in cells expressing Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> is not due to a block in mRNA degradation."

Thus, it was conceivable that the Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> mutant not only disrupted the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1, but also with additional factors, which may contribute to PB formation. We therefore generated a <i>NOT1</i> allele, <i>not1</i><sup>9X-Dhh1</sup> \u2013 with substitutions at conserved\u00a0amino acid residues that were previously shown to mediate interaction between CNOT1 and DDX6 (F791A, N795A, K804A, E832R, N834A, Y835A, K962A, F967A, and E970A) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mathys et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rouya et al., 2014</a>). We co-expressed Not1 or Not1<sup>9X-Dhh1</sup> along with Dhh1-GFP and Dcp2-mCherry and shifted cells into media with and without glucose to evaluate PB formation. While cells expressing wild-type Not1 showed diffuse Dhh1 and Dcp2 localization, the Not1<sup>9X-Dhh1</sup> mutant triggered colocalization of Dhh1 and Dcp2 into distinct foci in both glucose-rich and glucose starvation conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). While granule induction in these cells was less pronounced than in\u00a0Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>or\u00a0Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) in glucose-rich conditions, these foci contained other known PB components (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>), suggesting they are <i>bona fide</i> PBs. Additionally, Not1<sup>9X-Dhh1</sup> was expressed at wild-type Not1 levels (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). In summary, we conclude that the ATPase cycle of Dhh1 is a critical regulator of PB formation, and that Not1 regulates the ATPase activity of Dhh1\u00a0<i>in vivo</i>, preventing PB formation in glucose-rich conditions."

Interestingly, the Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> droplets slightly increased in size and number upon Not1<sup>MIF4G</sup> addition.

However, how the catalytic activity of Dhh1 contributes to its function has not been well defined. Here, we show that the ATPase activity of Dhh1 regulates the dynamics of PBs in an RNA-dependent manner. Point mutations in Dhh1 that prevent ATP hydrolysis or disrupt the interaction surface with the ATPase activator Not1 were sufficient to trigger aberrant PB formation <i>in vivo</i> in the absence of stress (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

In the absence of Not1<sup>MIF4G</sup> and RNA, we could not detect ATPase activity of Dhh1. Both Dhh1 and DDX6 alone adopt an unusual closed conformation, characterized by extensive intramolecular contacts that are not present in other members of the DEAD-box protein family (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cheng et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mathys et al., 2014</a>). Binding of CNOT1 causes a dramatic structural rearrangement, shifting DDX6 into an ATPase-competent state (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mathys et al., 2014</a>). However, even the Not1-stimulated activity of Dhh1 remains low (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Although the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle of DEAD-box ATPases often appears to be the release of substrate RNA and ADP/Pi (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Henn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hilbert et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2010</a>), it is conceivable that the large conformational change that Dhh1 must undergo in order to bind both Not1 and substrate significantly contributes to the slow ATPase cycle of Dhh1."

Neither Dhh1<sup>Q-motif</sup> nor Dhh1<sup>3X-RNA</sup> mutant cells robustly form PBs following glucose starvation. In addition, mutations that disrupt RNA binding also prevent constitutive PB formation of catalytically dead Dhh1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Remarkably, Dhh1 forms liquid droplets <i>in vitro</i> that require both ATP and RNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), indicating that multimeric assembly of Dhh1 in its ATP-bound state with RNA may drive PB formation. Since DDX6 can oligomerize in both an RNA-dependent and RNA-independent manner (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ernoult-Lange et al., 2012</a>), and given that both Dhh1 and DDX6 exist in molar excess over cytoplasmic mRNA (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nagaraj et al., 2011</a>), it is conceivable that an ATP-bound conformation of Dhh1 multimerizes on RNA <i>in vivo</i>, thereby delivering mRNAs to PBs and seeding PB assembly. Upon ATP hydrolysis, Dhh1 could then return to the cytoplasmic pool to bind and deliver the next mRNA target. However, when ATP hydrolysis is inhibited, such as in Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> or Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup>-expressing cells, Dhh1 remains associated with its mRNA client, triggering the formation of constitutive PBs."

                                "text": "Despite an increasing understanding of PB composition, the precise functional role of PBs remains unclear. Given the large number of mRNA decay factors present in PB assemblies, as well as the accumulation of Xrn1-protected polyG-tract-containing mRNAs, PBs were initially proposed to be sites of mRNA decay (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sheth and Parker, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</a>). However, several studies have shown that mRNAs can also stably localize within PBs, raising the question of whether these granules are sites of active mRNA decay or rather of mRNA storage (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hocine et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lavut and Raveh, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lui et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zid and O\u2019Shea, 2014</a>). It should be noted, however, that in many cases mRNAs were localized to PBs using either the MS2 or PP7 coat protein system, whereby multiple stem loops are engineered into the 3\u2019UTR of transcripts and then visualized using fluorescently tagged coat-protein fusions that recognize these stem loops. Yet, recent data indicate that these stem loop systems may inhibit mRNA decay in budding yeast, and that primarily these stem loop structures \u2013 but not the body of transcripts \u2013 persist in PBs, and cannot be degraded by Xrn1 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Garcia and Parker, 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Haimovich et al., 2016</a>; Heinrich and Weis, unpublished). Our smFISH data are consistent with the hypothesis that active decay occurs within PBs, since none of the four tested mRNAs were enriched in wild-type and Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> PBs in contrast to PBs in <i>xrn1\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>). Thus, selective delivery of mRNAs to PBs could enhance their degradation because of the high local concentration of the mRNA decay machinery in PBs. Alternatively, the sequestration of mRNA decay factors and selected mRNAs into PBs could also allow for spatial separation of translation factors from mRNA, preventing translation of messages that would be unproductive during periods of stress."

Furthermore, a variety of different ATP-driven protein machines have also emerged as important regulators of mRNP granule assembly. For example, stress granule (SG) assembly and dynamics are disrupted by loss-of-function alleles in the MCM and RVB helicase complexes, while hypomorphic alleles in the chaperonin-containing T (CCT) complex form more SGs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jain et al., 2016</a>). Additionally, the AAA+ ATPase Cdc48 was also previously shown to facilitate clearance of SGs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buchan et al., 2013</a>). Our data demonstrate that the DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1 is a critical regulator of PB disassembly <i>in vivo</i> and that liquid droplets containing Dhh1 multimers form in the presence of RNA and ATP, which can be dissolved upon induction of ATP hydrolysis <i>in vitro</i>. Two biochemical functions are critical for the role of Dhh1 in PB formation both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>: (1) Dhh1\u2019s affinity for RNA, which may facilitate delivery of mRNA substrates into PBs, and (2) ATP binding, and the tuning of Dhh1\u2019s ATPase activity by factors such as Not1. These features of Dhh1 may ultimately be the critical controllers of PB formation and PB turnover.\u00a0"

Still, there are several elements of the PB and Dhh1 ATPase cycle that remain unclear. For example, what leads to PB formation under specific cellular stress conditions? Is this driven by a stress-induced attenuation of translation or increase in mRNA turnover, which leads to an increased\u00a0number of client mRNAs targeted to PBs? Alternatively, cellular stress may dampen the ATPase activity of Dhh1, for example by regulating the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1, thereby shifting the equilibrium towards the ATP-bound, RNA-bound Dhh1 state. This in turn would then slow down PB disassembly, causing a build up of PB structures."

Microscopy was performed with an inverted epi-fluorescence microscope (Nikon Ti) equipped with a Spectra X LED light source and a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 sCMOS camera using a PlanApo 100 x NA 1.4 oil-immersion objective and the NIS Elements software. Images were processed using FIJI software. Quantification of colocalization was performed on all planes of a 3D stack image using the Colocalization Threshold tool in Fiji. In brief, images were background-subtracted and thresholded with a defined minimum threshold set for each smFISH probe separately. Then, the Colocalization Threshold tool was applied, which highlighted the colocalization between PB and mRNA. The colocalization events and the total number of PBs were then counted manually. The percentage of colocalization was calculated by forming the ratio between the number of PBs colocalizing with mRNA and the total number of PBs."

A Matlab script transformed our foci images into a single long sequence that could be fed to Diatrack. This allowed the same image analysis parameters to be applied across all images and experiments. PBs display significant variations in appearance (size and brightness). They were identified in Diatrack based on their intensity and contrast measure. Optimal parameters were selected interactively such that false negative and false positive rates were below 3%. Occasionally, yeast vacuoles pinch the cytoplasm against the cell wall. This tends to create narrow intensity ridges in some of our fluorescence images and can trigger the default Diatrack particle detector. Thus, we used an alternative contrast measure (\u2018blurred 360\u2019). This only retained particles around which the intensity decreases significantly in all directions (rather than decreasing on average only). A sample movie showing detected PB for a variety of images is provided as supplementary information (movieDetection.avi). For each image, a list of intensities corresponding to each PB in each image was exported from the software and further processed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). The sum of particle intensities represents a suitable measure of overall PB abundance. Alternately, the number of PBs per image may also be used. This value was divided by the number of cells in each image to deliver per-cell PB abundances. Automated counting of cells was performed as described in (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hadjidemetriou et al., 2008</a>)."

The MIF4G domain of Not1 (residues 754\u20131000) was cloned into a pETMCN-based expression vector with a N-terminal 6xHis and V5 tag. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3\u00a0cells grown in rich medium. Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6 and induced with 300 \u00b5M IPTG. Cells were then grown overnight at 18\u00b0C, harvested and resuspended in 30\u2009mL lysis buffer (500\u00a0mM NaCl, 25\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10\u2009mM imidazole, protease inhibitors) per cell pellet from 2\u00a0L of culture.

This leads to the proposal that trapping the mutant Dhh1-ATP on mRNA is the condition that evokes P body accumulation. In the course of this work, it is shown that Not1 binds to Dhh1 and activates its ATPase activity, extending previous findings on the mammalian orthologs CNOT and Ddx6, and then shown that deleting Not1 partially mimics the Dhh1 ATPase mutant in stimulating P body formation, consistent with their model. Evidence is also provided that aggregation of Dhh1-ATP/RNA complexes can be observed <i>in vitro</i> by the formation of liquid droplets that require ATP and RNA and can be dissolved by Not1. These results are potentially interesting in providing a first step in the reconstitution of P body formation <i>in vitro</i> by Dhh1-ATP-mRNA complexes."

This allows them to propose that trapping the mutant Dhh1-ATP on mRNA is the condition that evokes P body accumulation. In the course of this work, they show that Not1 binds to Dhh1 and activates its ATPase activity, extending previous findings on the mammalian orthologs CNOT and Ddx6, and then show that deleting Not1 partially mimics the Dhh1 ATPase mutant in stimulating P body formation, consistent with their model. They also provide evidence that aggregation of Dhh1-ATP/RNA complexes can be observed <i>in vitro</i> by the formation of liquid droplets that require ATP and RNA and can be dissolved by Not1. Additional controls are likely required for this assay, but the results are potentially interesting as a first step in the reconstitution of P body formation by Dhh1-ATP-mRNA complexes."

Thus, it appears that constitutive mRNA binding by Dhh1-ATP appears to evoke P bodies. They showed previously by FRAP that the ATPase mutant doesn't shuttle in and out of P-bodies and they show that the P bodies formed by this mutant also disassemble more slowly on cycloheximide treatment, although the interpretation of this result isn't stated. (Does it result from prolonged retention in P bodies of mRNAs bound to Dhh1-ATP?). Biochemical experiments show that, analogous to previous findings that mammalian CNOT stimulates the ATPase activity of mammalian Dhh1 (Ddx6), yeast Not1 stimulates the ATPase activity of yeast Dhh1 <i>in vitro</i> using recombinant proteins for the experiments. They identified a Dhh1 mutant that binds Not1 poorly compared to WT Dhh1, and showed that it mimics the ATPase mutant of Dhh1 in provoking P body formation that requires the RNA-binding activity of the mutant Dhh1, as expected if Not1 is required for ATP hydrolysis by Dhh1 and Dhh1-ATP is the trigger for P body formation. They attempted to prove that the Dhh1 mutant that impairs Not1 association evokes PBs only because of its reduced Not1 interaction by examining a Not1 variant lacking residues thought to be required for Dhh1 binding. It too induces PBs but to a much smaller extent than do the Dhh1 mutants; so they can't completely eliminate the possibility that the Dhh1 variant induces P bodies strictly owing to defective binding to Not1 and attendant reduction in ATPase activity. Note however that they would have to verify that these Not1 mutations actually do impair its binding to Dhh1. Finally, they show that <i>in vitro</i> Dhh1 can form liquid droplets that form in a concentration dependent fashion in a manner absolutely dependent on RNA (poly(U)) and ATP, and reversed by addition of the presumed Dhh1 interacting-domain of Not1. They propose that this represents an <i>in vitro</i> analogue of PB assembly, wherein Dhh1-ATP would multimerize on mRNA to nucleate P body formation. Additional controls seem to be required, such as showing that the ATPase Dhh1 mutant would be active, while the ATP-binding Dhh1 mutant would be inactive in this assay, and that Not1 would have no effect on droplet formation if the ATPase Dhh1 mutant was employed, or with non-hydrolyzable ATP and WT Dhh1."

This observation is also supported by the slower recycling of Dhh1<sub>DQAD</sub> from PBs in FRAP experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), and the slower dissolution of Dhh1<sub>DQAD</sub> PBs upon cycloheximide treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Currently, there are no Dhh1 mutants that would allow the uncoupling of the effects of Dhh1 on mRNA turnover and PB formation (and it is likely that such mutants may not exist) and we have therefore altered the text to more carefully discuss the role of Dhh1 in decay and PB formation."

This allows them to propose that trapping the mutant Dhh1-ATP on mRNA is the condition that evokes P body accumulation. In the course of this work, they show that Not1 binds to Dhh1 and activates its ATPase activity, extending previous findings on the mammalian orthologs CNOT and Ddx6, and then show that deleting Not1 partially mimics the Dhh1 ATPase mutant in stimulating P body formation, consistent with their model. They also provide evidence that aggregation of Dhh1-ATP/RNA complexes can be observed in vitro by the formation of liquid droplets that require ATP and RNA and can be dissolved by Not1. Additional controls are likely required for this assay, but the results are potentially interesting as a first step in the reconstitution of P body formation by Dhh1-ATP-mRNA complexes.</i> "

Thus, it appears that constitutive mRNA binding by Dhh1-ATP appears to evoke P bodies. They showed previously by FRAP that the ATPase mutant doesn't shuttle in and out of P-bodies and they show that the P bodies formed by this mutant also disassemble more slowly on cycloheximide treatment, although the interpretation of this result isn't stated. (Does it result from prolonged retention in P bodies of mRNAs bound to Dhh1-ATP?). Biochemical experiments show that, analogous to previous findings that mammalian CNOT stimulates the ATPase activity of mammalian Dhh1 (Ddx6), yeast Not1 stimulates the ATPase activity of yeast Dhh1 in vitro using recombinant proteins for the experiments. They identified a Dhh1 mutant that binds Not1 poorly compared to WT Dhh1, and showed that it mimics the ATPase mutant of Dhh1 in provoking P body formation that requires the RNA-binding activity of the mutant Dhh1, as expected if Not1 is required for ATP hydrolysis by Dhh1 and Dhh1-ATP is the trigger for P body formation. They attempted to prove that the Dhh1 mutant that impairs Not1 association evokes PBs only because of its reduced Not1 interaction by examining a Not1 variant lacking residues thought to be required for Dhh1 binding. It too induces PBs but to a much smaller extent than do the Dhh1 mutants; so they can't completely eliminate the possibility that the Dhh1 variant induces P bodies strictly owing to defective binding to Not1 and attendant reduction in ATPase activity. Note however that they would have to verify that these Not1 mutations actually do impair its binding to Dhh1. Finally, they show that in vitro Dhh1 can form liquid droplets that form in a concentration dependent fashion in a manner absolutely dependent on RNA (poly(U)) and ATP, and reversed by addition of the presumed Dhh1 interacting-domain of Not1. They propose that this represents an in vitro analogue of PB assembly, wherein Dhh1-ATP would multimerize on mRNA to nucleate P body formation. Additional controls seem to be required, such as showing that the ATPase Dhh1 mutant would be active, while the ATP-binding Dhh1 mutant would be inactive in this assay, and that Not1 would have no effect on droplet formation if the ATPase Dhh1 mutant was employed, or with non-hydrolyzable ATP and WT Dhh1.</i> "
