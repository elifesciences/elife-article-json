It has been proposed that endothelial cells have a preferred level of fluid shear stress, or \u2018set point\u2019, that determines remodeling. We show that human umbilical vein endothelial cells respond optimally within a range of fluid shear stress that approximate physiological shear. Lymphatic endothelial cells, which experience much lower flow in vivo, show similar effects but at lower value of shear stress. VEGFR3 levels, a component of a junctional mechanosensory complex, mediate these differences. Experiments in mice and zebrafish demonstrate that changing levels of VEGFR3/Flt4 modulates aortic lumen diameter consistent with flow-dependent remodeling. These data provide direct evidence for a fluid shear stress set point, identify a mechanism for varying the set point, and demonstrate its relevance to vessel remodeling in vivo."

It has been proposed that endothelial cells have a preferred level of fluid shear stress, or \u2018set point\u2019, that determines remodeling. We show that human umbilical vein endothelial cells respond optimally within a range of fluid shear stress that approximate physiological shear. Lymphatic endothelial cells, which experience much lower flow in vivo, show similar effects but at lower value of shear stress. VEGFR3 levels, a component of a junctional mechanosensory complex, mediate these differences. Experiments in mice and zebrafish demonstrate that changing levels of VEGFR3/Flt4 modulates aortic lumen diameter consistent with flow-dependent remodeling. These data provide direct evidence for a fluid shear stress set point, identify a mechanism for varying the set point, and demonstrate its relevance to vessel remodeling in vivo."

Changes in shear stress are sensed by the endothelial cells, which trigger vascular remodeling to return the stress to the original level. It has been proposed that remodeling is governed by a preferred level of fluid shear stress, or set point, against which deviations in the shear stress are compared. Thus, changing the fluid flow through a blood vessel increases or decreases shear stress, which results in the vessel remodeling to restore the original level of shear stress. Like all remodeling, this process involves inflammation to recruit white blood cells, which assist with the process."

These cells remained stable and in a resting state when a particular level of shear stress was applied to them; above or below this shear stress level, the cells produced an inflammatory response like that seen during vascular remodeling. This suggests that these cells do indeed have a set point for shear stress. The same response occurred in human lymphatic endothelial cells, although in these cells the shear stress set point was much lower, correlating with the low flow in lymphatic vessels."

Endothelial cells from lymphatic vessels normally produce much greater quantities of VEGFR3 than those from blood vessels. Reducing the amount of VEGFR3 in lymphatic endothelial cells increased the set point shear stress, while increasing the levels in blood vessel cells decreased the set point. This suggests that the levels of this protein account for the difference in the response of these two cell types. Baeyens et al. then tested this pathway by reducing the levels of VEGFR3 in zebrafish embryos and in adult mice. In both animals, this caused arteries to narrow, showing that VEGFR3 levels also control sensitivity to shear stress\u2014and hence vascular remodeling\u2014inside living creatures."

For example, changes in central body temperature trigger sweating, altered blood flow to the skin or shivering to restore normal temperature. In the vasculature, arteries remodel under sustained changes in blood flow, with increased or decreased flow triggering outward or inward remodeling, respectively, to adjust lumen diameters accordingly (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thoma, 1893</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kamiya and Togawa, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kamiya et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Langille and O'Donnell, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Langille et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Langille, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tronc et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tuttle et al., 2001</a>).

Moreover, if it exists, the set point must itself be variable, since different types of vessels, for example, arteries, veins and lymphatics, generally have very different magnitudes of fluid shear stress (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lipowsky et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dixon et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Suo et al., 2007</a>)."

In vivo, average shear stress in lymphatic vessels is much lower than in arteries or veins (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lipowsky et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dixon et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Suo et al., 2007</a>). We therefore examined the behavior of human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLEC), using modified chamber parameters to obtain values of shear stress from 0.5 to 20 dynes.cm<sup>\u22122</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In these experiments, HUVECs aligned between 8 and 20 dynes.cm<sup>\u22122</sup>, (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) whereas HDLEC aligned maximally between 4 and 6 dynes.cm<sup>\u22122</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The minimum for NF-\u03baB translocation also shifted to between 4 and 10 dynes.cm<sup>\u22122</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which corresponds well to in vivo measurements (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dixon et al., 2006</a>). These results indicate that lymphatics have a higher sensitivity to shear stress compared to HUVECs, consistent with the set point concept."

We therefore considered whether differences in expression of these proteins might account for the difference in flow sensitivity between HUVECs and HDLECs. However, no major differences in levels of these proteins were observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). VEGFR3, a close homolog of VEGFR2, is highly expressed in lymphatic cells (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kaipainen et al. 1995</a>) and recent work in our lab showed that it is activated by flow in vascular endothelial cells similarly to VEGFR2 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Coon et al., 2015</a>). These considerations prompted us to examine levels of this receptor as well, which showed approximately 10-fold higher expression in lymphatic ECs compared to HUVECs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

This system has the advantage that development proceeds normally without blood flow, thus, fluid shear stress can be altered or even stopped without affecting viability (<a href=\"#bib33\">Langheinrich et al., 2003</a>). The notion that levels of VEGFR3 (Flt4 in zebrafish) determine the shear stress set point predicts that reducing VEGFR3 expression will induce inward remodeling of the vessels in order to increase shear stress and restore normal signaling. We used a strain in which blood vessels are labeled by expression of <i>kdrl:mCherry</i> (VEGFR2) and <i>flt4:Citrine</i> (VEGFR3) reporters. <i>kdrl:mCherry</i> was highly visible in the dorsal aorta and the posterior cardinal vein, whereas <i>flt4:Citrine</i> was low (though detectable) in the dorsal aorta and higher in the cardinal posterior vein and the developing thoracic duct (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Flt4/VEGFR3 and its ligand, VEGF-C, are associated with development of lymphatic vasculature and segmental arteries in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib15\">Covassin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kuchler et al., 2006</a>). To assay the effect of FLT4 and VEGFC dosage on vessels diameter, we injected zebrafish embryos at the one cell stage with previously validated VEGFC and FLT4 morpholinos at two different concentrations. These antisense oligos target the respective mRNAs and induce a dose dependent loss of function (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nicoli et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Villefranc et al., 2013</a>). At 72 hr post fertilization (hpf), the progressive inhibition of VEGFC did not perturb the remodeling of blood vessel or vessel diameter but as expected inhibited the development of the thoracic duct, the first zebrafish lymphatic vessel (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yaniv et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, white stars). By contrast, progressive inhibition of FLT4 reduced the diameter of the dorsal aorta with loss of thoracic duct evident at a higher dose of FLT4 morpholino (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). These results suggested that VEGF-C-independent Flt4 activation is required for artery diameter and exclude an indirect effect of lymphatic development on the artery development. Interestingly, a similar decrease of the dorsal aorta diameter can be observed in a recent paper (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kwon et al., 2013</a>). Although these authors focused on the growth of motoneurons, the dorsal aorta is readily visible in images of Flt1 mCherry reporter embryos; its diameter is obviously smaller in <i>expando</i> embryos expressing a kinase dead Flt4, as well as in wildtype embryos treated with Flt4 morpholino or VEGFR3 inhibitors but not after injection with VEGFC morpholino, in accordance with our own observations."

For more than a century, investigators have observed effects suggesting that the blood flow controls vascular diameter (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thoma, 1893</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Langille and O'Donnell, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Langille et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Langille, 1996</a>), a mechanism that would optimize perfusion by adjusting vascular morphology in response to tissue demand. It has been hypothesized that, as for thermoregulation, there is an optimal value of flow which is maintained through feedback mechanisms to prevent deviation from this value. This is what we term the \u2018shear stress set point\u2019 theory (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rodbard, 1975</a>). The current data show that HUVECs align in the direction of flow, inhibit NF-\u03baB and activate Smads within a narrow range of fluid shear stress magnitudes. This range corresponds to the physiological flow within the umbilical vein estimated at around 8.4 to 12.5 dynes.cm<sup>\u22122</sup> ((<a href=\"#bib29\">Kiserud and Rasmussen, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boito et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Christensen et al., 2014</a>); shear stress = 8 \u00d7 viscosity (velocity/diameter), with viscosity = 0.06\u20130.09 poisse, velocity = 7.1 cm.s<sup>\u22121</sup> and diameter = 4.1 mm). These results imply that physiological flow inhibits inflammatory pathways and activates anti-inflammatory/stabilization pathways. By contrast, cells in low or high flow fail to align, activate NF-\u03baB and suppress Smads. We propose that these responses are involved in the vessel remodeling that reestablishes optimal blood flow."

On the other hand, defective Smad1 signaling in the endothelium is associated with hereditary haemorrhagic telengiectasia (HHT), which is characterized by the development of unstable, arteriovenous malformations (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dupuis-Girod et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, these malformations are preceded by increased vascular lumen diameter, which occurs in a flow dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib14\">Corti et al., 2011</a>).

Relevant to our experiments, the shear stress in the human umbilical vein is estimated at around 8.4\u201312.5 dynes/cm<sup>\u22122</sup> whereas lymphatic vessels have highly pulsatile flow with peaks values at around 4\u20138 dynes.cm<sup>\u22122</sup> and averages that are much lower (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dixon et al., 2006</a>). The shear stress set point model therefore predicts that these cell types will have different set points, which was borne out in our studies. Furthermore, we found that this difference can be largely accounted for by differences in VEGFR3 expression. This receptor, a close homolog of VEGFR2, is also activated in response to flow. Both expression levels in vivo (<a href=\"#bib65\">Witmer et al., 2002</a>) and our functional experiments in vitro lead to the conclusion that high expression of VEGFR3 increases sensitivity to shear to give a low shear stress set point, while low expression of VEGFR3 is associated with higher set points. However, it is highly likely that other mechanotransducers or mediators influence set point values. While we did not observe any major difference in PECAM-1 and VE-cadherin expression between HDLEC and HUVEC, these two proteins can vary between different vascular beds (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pusztaszeri et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Herwig et al., 2008</a>), which might also affect the set point. We used HUVECs as a model for blood endothelial cells because they are readily available and their response to shear stress is well characterized. However, it has been recently showed that arterial and venous markers greatly diminish in culture (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aranguren et al., 2013</a>), thus, whether they fully represent typical venous cells in vivo should be treated with caution. Comparing fresh primary cells from veins and arteries will be an interesting direction for future work. Mechanotransducers apart from the junctional complex are also likely to be important. There must also be pathways that distinguish high and low shear to initiate outward vs inward remodeling. Future work will be required to explore these pathways in more detail and their relevance to vascular remodeling."

Mice were euthanized then fixed by perfusion with 3.7% formaldehyde 1, 2, 3 or 7 weeks after induction. Ear tissue was fixed overnight in 3.7% formaldehyde. The ear skin was removed, cleaned of connective tissue and cartilage, and permeabilized for 4 hr in permeabilization buffer (1% BSA, 1% NGS, 0.5% Tween in PBS).

Or it could be a feature of the complex mechanics of the ascending aorta, which moves axially during each cardiac cycle and would be predicted to differentially load the inner and outer curvature (Kassab, 2006). We thought it appropriate to make a note of the observation but feel that anything we could say would be largely speculative as well as being unrelated to the main point of the paper and to any known remodeling process in vivo."

It is also well established that production of nitric oxide in response to flow is mediated in part by the PECAM/VE-cadherin-VEGFR2 pathway (Jin, Ueba et al., 2003; Fleming, Fisslthaler et al., 2005).
