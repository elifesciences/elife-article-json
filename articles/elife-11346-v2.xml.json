A large-scale screen for aggression-promoting neurons in <i>Drosophila</i> identified several independent hits that enhanced both inter-male aggression and courtship. Genetic intersections revealed that 8-10 P1 interneurons, previously thought to exclusively control male courtship, were sufficient to promote fighting. Optogenetic experiments indicated that P1 activation could promote aggression at a threshold below that required for wing extension. P1 activation in the absence of wing extension triggered persistent aggression via an internal state that could endure for minutes. High-frequency P1 activation promoted wing extension and suppressed aggression during photostimulation, whereas aggression resumed and wing extension was inhibited following photostimulation offset. Thus, P1 neuron activation promotes a latent, internal state that facilitates aggression and courtship, and controls the overt expression of these social behaviors in a threshold-dependent, inverse manner."

A large-scale screen for aggression-promoting neurons in <i>Drosophila</i> identified several independent hits that enhanced both inter-male aggression and courtship. Genetic intersections revealed that 8-10 P1 interneurons, previously thought to exclusively control male courtship, were sufficient to promote fighting. Optogenetic experiments indicated that P1 activation could promote aggression at a threshold below that required for wing extension. P1 activation in the absence of wing extension triggered persistent aggression via an internal state that could endure for minutes. High-frequency P1 activation promoted wing extension and suppressed aggression during photostimulation, whereas aggression resumed and wing extension was inhibited following photostimulation offset. Thus, P1 neuron activation promotes a latent, internal state that facilitates aggression and courtship, and controls the overt expression of these social behaviors in a threshold-dependent, inverse manner."

While this identified some neurons that specifically promoted aggression, it also uncovered a cluster \u2013 called P1 neurons \u2013 that promoted both aggression and courtship. This was unexpected, because P1 neurons were previously thought to only control courtship behavior."

Moreover, the P1 neurons triggered a lasting change in the internal state of the male that increased his tendency to engage in aggression or courtship. These results are reminiscent of observations made in mice, suggesting small groups of neurons that control mating and fighting may represent an evolutionarily conserved neural circuit \"motif\" for the control of social behavior."

It serves to establish dominance, or to defend or obtain resources, territory or mating partners. While it is part of most animals' normal behavioral repertoire, maladaptive aggression in humans takes an enormous toll on society (<a href=\"#bib28\">Filley et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Miczek et al., 2007</a>). Yet, we know remarkably little about how the evolutionarily ancient capacity to fight is hardwired into the brain. How are aggression circuits functionally organized?

Recently, through a small-scale screen of neuropeptide-expressing neurons (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hergarden et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Tayler et al., 2012</a>), we identified a population of ~3\u20135 sexually dimorphic Fru<sup>M</sup> neurons that control male aggression, via release of <i>Drosophila</i> tachykinin (DTK) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Asahina et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, manipulation of that cell population had no influence on courtship behavior. Thus, DTK<sup>FruM</sup> neurons represent the first subclass of Fru<sup>M</sup>-expressing neurons that appears specific to the control of aggression."

Our results indicate, surprisingly, that at least a subset of P1 neurons, previously thought to control exclusively courtship, can promote male aggression as well. Moreover, we show that they exert this influence by inducing a persistent fly-intrinsic state, lasting for minutes, that enhances these behaviors. These data define a sexually dimorphic neural circuit node that may link internal states to the control of mating and fighting, and identify a potentially conserved circuit 'motif' for the control of social behaviors."

We generated spGAL4 AD and DBD 'hemi-driver' transgenic flies using the enhancers from each of the three parental lines and tested the different combinations for expression by crossing to UAS-myr::GFP. Indeed, the spGAL4 intersection of R15A01-AD and R71G01-DBD (henceforth referred to as P1<sup>a</sup> spGAL4) labeled approximately 8\u201310 Fru<sup>M</sup>-expressing P1 neurons per hemibrain (see also <a href=\"#bib41\">Inagaki et al., 2013</a>); no labeling was observed in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This number of labeled P1 neurons was similar to that in the parental R15A01-GAL4 line (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). In addition to P1 neurons, the P1<sup>a</sup> spGAL4 driver labeled a minor and variable population of neurons (&lt;4 per hemibrain) with cell bodies in the lateral horn (LH) that were neither Fru<sup>M</sup>-positive nor male-specific (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Other hemi-driver intersectional combinations with R22G11-DBD showed a similar labeling pattern (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B and C</a>).

Other spGAL4 combinations (with R22G11-DBD) tested showed a similar increase in both behaviors (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E and F</a>). Closer examination of the time course of the interactions between pairs of P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;dTrpA1 males revealed that the flies exhibited interspersed bouts of aggression and wing extension throughout the duration of the observation period (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, top; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>).

To distinguish between these alternatives, we asked whether activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons could promote unilateral attack towards a non-aggressive target fly. To do this, we paired group-housed P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;dTrpA1 males with group-housed wild-type (WT) Canton S males, which show little or no aggression (<a href=\"#bib94\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). In such mixed-genotype pairs, P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;dTrpA1 males still showed a significant increase in lunging towards the WT target male throughout the observation period, in comparison to BDPG4U&gt;dTrpA1 controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1G</a>, lower and 1H). The lunging frequency per P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;dTrpA1 male was not significantly different between same genotype (P1<sup>a</sup> vs P1<sup>a</sup>) and mixed-genotype pairs (P1<sup>a</sup> vs WT) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). In contrast, the WT target males (identified by clipping the tip of one wing) showed no significant lunging behavior towards the P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;dTrpA1 aggressor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, left panel, Tester: WT). These data indicate that the sustained increase in aggression caused by activating P1<sup>a</sup> neurons in a mixed pair does not depend on counter-attack by the target fly."

However, in mixed genotype pairs, the P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;dTrpA1 tester flies attacked the group-housed WT target flies despite the fact that the latter exhibited little or no wing extension behavior (<a href=\"#bib94\">Wang et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, right panel, Tester: WT). In addition, activation of P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;dTrpA1 males from which both wings had been surgically removed also yielded robust fighting behavior (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Finally, activation of other GAL4 lines that promoted increased unilateral wing extension behavior did not cause a concomitant increase in aggression (data not shown). These data indicate that increased male wing extension behavior is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the increased aggression phenotype. Taken together, these results indicate that the aggression phenotype reflects a fly-intrinsic influence of P1<sup>a</sup> neuron activation."

To investigate more systematically whether elevated aggression and wing extension could be separated by manipulating the level of activity among P1 neurons, we turned to optogenetic effectors, which afford greater control over the dynamic range of neuronal activation than does dTrpA1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Inagaki et al., 2013</a>). To minimize interference with visual cues, which are important for aggression, we used the red-shifted opsin CsChrimson (<a href=\"#bib48\">Klapoetke et al., 2014</a>) at 685\u00a0nm, a wavelength to which flies are relatively insensitive, and low light-power density (0.02\u00a0mW/mm<sup>2</sup>).

The inhibition of aggression during PS was unlikely due to an effect of the light itself, as flies are relatively insensitive to the red wavelength used (685\u00a0nm) and aggression was not suppressed during PS at frequencies \u226420 Hz (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Therefore, strong activation of wing extension may physically interfere with or otherwise suppress aggression. We also observed that high-frequency P1 activation promoted extended periods of locomotor arrest, which was relieved following PS offset (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C-E</a>). As lunging requires active locomotion, such immobility may physically prevent it. By contrast, wing extension during PS occurred frequently in stationary flies (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>)."

Therefore, we wondered whether it was caused by aggression per se, or rather reflected some independent parallel influence to suppress wing extension following stimulus offset. To address this possibility, we performed an epistasis experiment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>) in which optogenetic P1 activation was performed while simultaneously inhibiting a population of <i>Drosophila</i> tachykinin-expressing, Fru<sup>M</sup> neurons (TK<sup>FruM</sup> neurons; a subset of so-called aSP6 Fru<sup>M</sup> neurons; <a href=\"#bib103\">Yu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Kohl et al., 2013</a>) previously shown to be necessary and sufficient for aggression (<a href=\"#bib5\">Asahina et al., 2014</a>)."

Under these conditions, wing extension was robustly induced during PS, but switched to aggression following PS offset; this lunging persisted for at least 10 min (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A\u2212C</a>). Such robust, persistent aggression could also be triggered by weaker photosimulation conditions that promoted only occasional wing extension bouts in a subset of flies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4D\u2212F</a>). Under these latter conditions, persistent post-PS aggression was triggered even in the cohort of fly pairs (8/22) that showed no wing extension at all during the PS period (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

These results suggested that persistent aggression was not simply perpetuated by self-sustaining cycles of attack and counter-attack, but likely reflected a long-lived internal state in the tester fly. However, it remained formally possible that the act of attacking and defeating the target fly was behaviorally self-reinforcing, as demonstrated in rodents (<a href=\"#bib29\">Fish et al., 2002</a>).

We optogenetically activated P1 neurons in such separated males for 1 min, and waited various lengths of time before removing the barrier and allowing the males to interact (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, right). As expected, separated P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;ReaChR males (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), but not BDPG4U&gt;ReaChR males (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), showed a robust increase in wing extension during PS, which persisted after light offset (<a href=\"#bib41\">Inagaki et al., 2013</a>). Upon removal of the barrier 1 min after PS offset (a time when the flies were still performing wing extensions), these P1<sup>a</sup> &gt;ReaChR males switched to aggression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5B</a>, blue rasters). Strikingly, enhanced aggression was observed even when removal of the barrier was delayed for 10 min after the offset of PS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5D and E</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>), by which time persistent wing extension behavior (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), as well as locomotor activity (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), had decayed to baseline levels for at least 5 min. The level of lunging after barrier removal for both the 1 min and 10 min conditions was significantly elevated compared to BDPG4U&gt;ReaChR controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), as well as control P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;ReaChR males that received no PS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Although the latency to lunging was not significantly different between barrier removal at 1 min vs. 10 min (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), the flies took longer to achieve maximal levels of aggression in the latter case, suggestive of a decay in the internal state promoted by P1<sup>a</sup> activation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Together, these experiments suggest that P1 neuron activation triggers a persistent internal state facilitating future social behaviors, which can endure for minutes in behaviorally quiescent solitary flies."

Here, we report the results of the first large-scale systematic screen, in any species, for neurons that promote inter-male aggression when artificially activated. Thermogenetic activation of ~3,000 <i>Drosophila</i> GAL4 lines (<a href=\"#bib43\">Jenett et al., 2012</a>) using the temperature-sensitive cation channel dTrpA1 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hamada et al., 2008</a>) yielded ~20 hits exhibiting elevated aggression, indicating a high level of specificity. While the majority of these hits displayed an aggression-specific phenotype (lunging, wing\u00a0threat, tussling), three of them exhibited a mixture of increased aggression and increased inter-male courtship (measured as unilateral wing extension). Although each of these three hits expressed GAL4 under the control of a different DNA cis-regulatory element (<a href=\"#bib72\">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</a>), and labeled different groups of neurons numbering in the hundreds, the expression pattern of all three lines included P1 interneurons. Remarkably, intersectional experiments using the split-GAL4 technique revealed that the P1 neurons were virtually the only cells in common between these three hits, and, moreover, that these neurons were responsible for both the aggression and wing extension phenotypes. The fact that P1 neurons were independently recovered in three independent hits, constituting only 0.1% of the lines initially screened, and could be isolated from 'contaminating' cell types by carrying out pair-wise intersectional combinations of these hits (<a href=\"#bib61\">Luan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</a>), testifies to the reproducibility of the phenotype and the power of the screen to reveal rare populations of neurons that control social behavior in <i>Drosophila</i>."

Indeed, we were initially concerned that the elevated aggression phenotype might simply be an indirect, social response to elevated inter-male wing extensions promoted by P1 activation. However, in mixed-genotype pairs, activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons produced aggression towards group-housed wild-type flies that did not exhibit any wing extension. Furthermore, activation with dTrpA1 of a small subset of Fru<sup>M</sup>+ P1 neurons (~2\u20135 of 20 per hemibrain) yielded flies that exhibited increased aggression without a concomitant increase in wing extension behavior. These data suggest that activation of P1 neurons promotes aggression in a fly-intrinsic manner, and is not an indirect social response provoked by elevated wing extension behavior."

Technical limitations in <i>Drosophila</i> currently preclude the ability to record neuronal activity from freely behaving flies engaged in social behavior, unlike the case in mice (<a href=\"#bib58\">Lin et al., 2011</a>), leaving open the question of whether P1 neurons are normally activated during aggressive encounters. Thus, while artificial activation of P1 neurons can promote aggression, it remains unclear whether they are normally required for this behavior, and if so under what circumstances."

At low frequencies of photostimulation (\u226420 Hz), a modest but significant increase in aggression was evoked, without any accompanying increase in unilateral wing extension behavior. Wing extension was evoked at photostimulation frequencies above 30 Hz. We note, however, that the ability to separate these two behaviors depended upon a number of experimental parameters, including light intensity, the type of effector used and the chromosomal insertion site of the effector. In general, however, weaker optogenetic stimulation tended to favor aggression, while higher levels favored wing extension. These data suggest that output from the P1 population can control different behaviors at different thresholds. However, we caution that the stimulation frequency-dependence of evoked aggression vs. wing extension behavior observed here may reflect our gain-of-function assay conditions (<a href=\"#bib70\">Pan et al., 2012</a>), and may not necessarily apply during naturally occurring male-male or male-female social behavior. Nevertheless, it is of interest that studies of hypothalamic circuits in mice have also revealed a threshold-dependent influence of optogenetic activation on mating and aggression (although opposite to the direction observed here) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hong et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Lee et al., 2014</a>).

Our cellular epistasis experiment revealed that when aggression is inhibited, by silencing TK-GAL4<sup>1</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Asahina et al., 2014</a>), wing extension triggered by optogenetic activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons persists into the light OFF phase, as described previously for single male flies (<a href=\"#bib41\">Inagaki et al., 2013</a>). This result indicates that aggressive behavior causally suppresses wing extension following the offset of photostimulation, suggestive of an inhibitory influence at the neural circuit or behavioral level. By extension, the suppression of lunging during the light ON phase may reflect a reciprocal inhibitory influence of courtship circuitry on aggression (however, the acute suppression of locomotor activity produced by strong optogenetic activation of P1 neurons may contribute to the inhibition of aggression as well). Rebound from such inhibition could then explain the rapid resumption of attack following the offset of high-intensity P1<sup>a</sup> photostimulation. The existence of reciprocal inhibitory influences between circuits controlling 'opponent' behaviors is well established (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib53\">Kristan, 2008</a>). Our observations raise the possibility that such mutual antagonism may control the choice between courtship and aggression as well."

However, because that persistent effect was detected as ongoing singing, it was not possible to distinguish whether it reflected a persistent <i>internal</i> state, or rather reflected singing-dependent sensori-motor positive-feedback. Since aggression requires a physical interaction between two flies, we were able to distinguish these alternatives by isolating the flies from each other during and after optogenetic P1 activation. This experiment revealed that transient activation of P1 neurons could result in enhanced aggression, even when physical contact between the flies was delayed for 10 min, long after persistent singing had decayed to baseline. Thus, activation of P1 neurons can induce a persistent, fly-intrinsic internal state (e.g., of arousal or motivation) that facilitates future social behavior. This state can endure without any increase in locomotor activity, suggesting that it does not simply reflect a state of generalized arousal (<a href=\"#bib89\">van Swinderen and Andretic, 2003</a>); however, it is difficult to prove that it exclusively influences social behavior."

In a direct model, P1 neurons (or a specific subset thereof) could activate persistent aggression-specific circuits (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In an indirect model, P1 neurons would trigger a persistent internal state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), which is neutral with respect to aggression or courtship, and the influence of that state to promote aggression would be determined at a downstream site in the circuit. We observed that optogenetic activation of P1 neurons never triggered aggression in a stimulus-locked manner during the light ON phase, even during low frequency stimulation where no wing extension behavior was evoked; rather an increase in aggression was typically observed following PS offset (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, 10 Hz and 20 Hz). Such observations would seem to support an indirect model. However in preliminary studies, we have identified another small group of neurons from our screen, whose optogenetic activation promotes aggression but not courtship; these aggression-specific neurons can be activated by stimulation of P1 cells (Y. J., H. Chiu, E.D.H. and D.J.A., unpublished observations). Thus, it is possible that P1 neurons directly activate or prime persistent aggression-promoting circuitry, but that other effects of phasic photostimulation (e.g., locomotor arrest) interfere with overt fighting behavior."

These influences may be exerted by common or distinct subpopulations of P1 neurons (not illustrated). Following the offset of phasic P1 activation, the persistent aggression state drives overt fighting behavior in the presence of a male conspecific. In the absence of a male (or presence of a female), persistent courtship behavior is expressed. Reciprocal inhibition between aggression and courtship circuitry is posited to occur at some point downstream of P1 neurons (blunt arrows), although if the P1 population is heterogeneous it could occur within that population as well (not shown). (<b>B</b>) 'Indirect' model. Activation of P1 neurons at a relatively low level triggers a persistent internal state ('<i>ps</i>') that is neutral with respect to aggression vs. courtship. This state can facilitate either social behavior, depending upon the sex of the conspecific encountered. A parallel, high-threshold pathway that directly activates command modules for courtship song (<a href=\"#bib91\">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</a>) is included to account for the effect of acute optogenetic activation of P1 neurons to trigger stimulus-locked wing extension behavior (<a href=\"#bib41\">Inagaki et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bath et al., 2014</a>).

At the same time, the inhibitory influence of acute P1 activation on fighting may serve to suppress aggression towards a female when a male fly is directly engaged in courtship or mating behavior. In this way, P1 neurons could exert both inhibitory and facilitatory influences on aggression, albeit on different time scales."

Our understanding of how this decision is made at the neural circuit level is limited. In principle, such a decision should reflect the combined influences of sensory cues (such as pheromones), past experience and internal state (<a href=\"#bib14\">Certel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Certel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Palmer and Kristan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Palmer et al., 2014</a>). Tinbergen (<a href=\"#bib88\">Tinbergen, 1951</a>) proposed that such decisions are made in a hierarchical manner. According to his view, this decision hierarchy is implemented in the nervous system as a series of feed-forward connections between circuit nodes that control progressively more specific aspects of behavior. Thus, for example, the decision to engage in predator defense vs. reproductive behavior is made before the decision to engage in a particular reproductive activity, such as mating vs. fighting; this decision is in turn made before the decision between different aggressive actions is taken (e.g., threat display vs. physical attack) (<a href=\"#bib87\">Tinbergen, 1950</a>)."

Our discovery of a small cluster of neurons in <i>Drosophila</i> that collectively can control both fighting and mating behavior appears consistent with this prediction. Tinbergen also proposed that such common modules would be the site at which internal state influences exerted their effects to promote behavioral arousal or motivation (<a href=\"#bib88\">Tinbergen, 1951</a>). Our finding that P1 neurons promote a persistent internal state that facilitates both courtship and aggression would seem consistent with this proposal as well. The independent discovery of a relatively small population of neurons that controls mating and fighting in the mouse hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib58\">Lin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Lee et al., 2014</a>), moreover, suggests that such common nodes may represent an evolutionarily conserved circuit 'motif' for the organization and control of innate social behaviors."

The fraction of pairs performing lunging or wing extension was binned in 10 s time intervals. A linear model was fit to the data and the best-fit value of the slope was calculated. For non-linear regressions, a sigmoidal function was fit to the data and the best-fit value for the half-maximal response (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was calculated. Goodness of fit was tested by two-way ANOVA between the predicted function (line or sigmoid) and the actual fraction of flies performing the behavior, which indicated a good fit in all cases."

An ROI was manually drawn around each cell body and the fluorescence signal from the ROI was smoothed with a moving average (window = 5 frames). The average signal before stimulation was used as F<sub>0</sub> to calculate the \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> (\u0394F/F). For each cell, a single focal plane in which we\u00a0observed the highest \u0394F/F was used for analysis. Normalized \u0394F/F values for each cell were calculated by dividing \u0394F/F by the maximum \u0394F/F of the cell. The peak \u0394F/F at each stimulation frequency was selected by finding the maximum normalized \u0394F/F during the 30 s stimulation window.

The core claim(s) presented by these authors is that P1 neurons (at least a subset of them) mediate aggression as well as courtship. This is based on findings of an innovative and impressive screen for neurons whose activation triggers aggressive behaviors, as well as careful genetic follow up experiments, that identify a role for P1 neurons in aggression as well as the already established role in courtship. The claim is extended to the idea that P1 neurons are multiplex units as illustrated by differential functional outcomes associated with differential levels of stimulation. Deploying optogenetic stimulation in different ways, the authors show that weak activation of P1 neurons promotes aggression and no courtship, while stronger activation evokes wing extension, i.e. courtship behavior, and suppressed aggression. Hence both social behaviors are reciprocally controlled by activation of P1 neurons representing an antagonistic interaction between the aggression and courtship circuitry. In addition the authors show that aggression behavior can persist more than 10 min. and requires chemosensory cues on a conspecific target to be induced."

However it is not possible to conclude whether this is a deterministic (aggression-specific) or stochastic subset of the cells. The frequency titration experiments using CsChrimson (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), and the new imaging data supporting these experiments in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (see point (C), below) are consistent with the idea that the average level of activity among the P1<sup>a</sup> subset of P1 neurons determines the behavioral outcome. However, they do not preclude the possibility of functional heterogeneity within this subpopulation, as we acknowledged in the original submission. Our ability to resolve this issue at the level of single, identified neurons is currently limited by available technology. We have acknowledged this as an open question in the revised Discussion: \u201cHow and where these behavioral thresholds are set, and whether they involve common or distinct subsets of P1 neurons, will be an interesting topic for future investigation\u201d."

We find that the 6 P1<sup>a</sup> neurons sampled (in each of n=3 flies) show a roughly linear increase in activity across the photostimulation range of ~10-50Hz, and that the normalized response is similar across the sampled neurons.

To answer the reviewers\u2019 last question, the immediate downstream neural circuitry that drives male-male courtship involves a descending interneuron called pIP10. Activation of pIP10 neurons promoted wing extension (as reported by von Philipsborn et al. (2011), but in our hands did not promote aggression. In preliminary experiments, we have identified a small group (2-3/hemibrain) of cells that are activated by P1 neurons; optogenetic activation of these neurons in freely behaving flies promotes aggression but not courtship. These unpublished data are now mentioned in the aforementioned subsection. Together these results suggest that courtship and aggression circuits likely diverge downstream of P1 neurons."
