Mammarenavirus infections contribute significantly to the human disease burden in both Africa and the Americas, but little data exists for Asia. To date only two mammarenaviruses, the widely spread lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and the recently described W\u0113nzh\u014du virus have been identified in this region, but the zoonotic impact in Asia remains unknown. Here we report the presence of a novel mammarenavirus and of a genetic variant of the W\u0113nzh\u014du virus and provide evidence of mammarenavirus-associated human infection in Asia. The association of these viruses with widely distributed mammals of diverse species, commonly found in human dwellings and in peridomestic habitats, illustrates the potential for widespread zoonotic transmission and adds to the known aetiologies of infectious diseases for this region."

Mammarenavirus infections contribute significantly to the human disease burden in both Africa and the Americas, but little data exists for Asia. To date only two mammarenaviruses, the widely spread lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and the recently described W\u0113nzh\u014du virus have been identified in this region, but the zoonotic impact in Asia remains unknown. Here we report the presence of a novel mammarenavirus and of a genetic variant of the W\u0113nzh\u014du virus and provide evidence of mammarenavirus-associated human infection in Asia. The association of these viruses with widely distributed mammals of diverse species, commonly found in human dwellings and in peridomestic habitats, illustrates the potential for widespread zoonotic transmission and adds to the known aetiologies of infectious diseases for this region."

Certain species thrive in cities and agricultural areas where they come in close contact with humans; this creates many opportunities to spread infection. As humans urbanize and farm larger swaths of previously wild lands, the risk of rodent-transmitted infections increases. As a result, some scientists are working to identify viruses carried by rodents in human settlements and hopefully prevent them from spreading to humans."

                        "text": "Mammarenaviruses are predominantly rodent-borne viruses, several of which have been associated with human disease. In Western Africa, Lassa virus (LASV) infection causes an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 infections and approximately 5000 deaths annually (<a href=\"#bib35\">McCormick et al., 1987</a>), whilst Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV) causes regular seasonal outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fever in Argentina (<a href=\"#bib23\">G\u00f3mez et al., 2011</a>). So far only W\u0113nzh\u014du virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) have been conclusively demonstrated to be present in Asia (<a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Morita et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">1991</a>). W\u0113nzh\u014du virus was identified in China in rodents belonging to four <i>Rattus</i> species, <i>Niviventer niviventer</i> and in Asian house shrews (<i>Suncus murinus</i>), but has not yet been associated with disease. However, LCMV is zoonotic, is primarily hosted by the widespread house mouse (<i>Mus musculus),</i> and consequently has the widest known distribution of any mammarenavirus (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buchmeier et al., 2007</a>). Human infection with LCMV predominantly results in a relatively mild influenza-like illness (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bonthius, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Macneil et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib12\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2012</a>). This propensity of some mammarenaviruses to cause mild disease with symptoms common to those found for many other viral infections, illustrates the potential for these infections to go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. That human infections caused by arenaviruses other than LCMV have not previously been detected in Southeastern Asia (<a href=\"#bib13\">Charrel and de Lamballerie, 2003</a>) should therefore not be considered as evidence of absence. As each mammarenavirus is primarily adapted to rodents of distinct species or to closely related rodents of diverse species (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gonzalez et al., 2007</a>), the apparent absence of these viruses from a region with high rodent biodiversity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pag\u00e8s et al., 2010</a>) is surprising. A large proportion of infectious diseases remain undiagnosed in resource poor countries where people rarely visit healthcare professionals and where clinicians often do not have the training or laboratory support for accurate diagnosis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mueller et al., 2014</a>). Here, in the course of a survey for rodent-borne mammarenaviruses, we identified a genetic variant of the recently identified W\u0113nzh\u014du virus in Cambodia - provisionally named Cardamones - in rodents belonging to two widespread species, brown rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) and Pacific rats (<i>R. exulans</i>), which are commonly found in proximity to humans. We also identified a novel mammarenavirus species in Thailand in rice-field associated greater bandicoot rats (<i>Bandicota indica</i>), Savile\u2019s bandicoot rats (<i>B. savilei)</i> and an Indomalayan niviventer (<i>Niviventer fulvescens</i>). In addition, we detected W\u0113nzh\u014du virus in several Cambodian patients presenting with fever and respiratory symptoms, indicating that this virus may be causally related with human disease."

Based on the hypothesis of rodent-mammarenavirus interrelation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gonzalez et al., 2007</a>) and the presence of only Old World rodents in the region (<a href=\"#bib34\">Marshall et al., 1988</a>), primers targeting Old World mammarenaviruses were used. We detected evidence of mammarenavirus RNA in twenty seven animals from two locations: Veal Renh in Cambodia and Loei in Thailand. Seventeen individuals from two peridomestic species, brown rats (four individuals) and Pacific rats (thirteen individuals), were identified positive in Veal Renh. In Loei, ten individuals from three agricultural-associated species were found positive, namely six Savile\u2019s bandicoot rats, three greater bandicoot rats and one Indomalayan niviventer (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>).

Full genome sequencing was attempted on a single sample from each site: C0649, originally obtained from a wild-caught Pacific rat from Veal Renh, and R5074, originally obtained from a wild-caught Savile\u2019s bandicoot rat from Loei. Coding-complete genomes of isolates were acquired by deep sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000) of random amplified RNAs from the lungs of Wistar laboratory rats inoculated with either the C0649 or R5074 lung homogenate (C0649: S segment accession KC669696, length 3331 nucleotides (nt); L segment accession KC669690, length 7181nt. R5074: S segment accession KC669698, length 3345nt; L segment accession KC669693, length 7186nt). Primers were designed based on this sequence and in conjunction with a previously published protocol (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bowen et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>), were used to obtain the coding-complete genome of two further isolates: C0617, obtained from a wild-caught brown rat, (S segment accession KC669694, length 3344nt; L segment accession KC669691, length 7171nt) and R4937, obtained from a wild-caught greater bandicoot rat (S segment accession KC669697, length 3379nt; L segment accession KC669692, length 7185nt). Each segment encoded two open reading frames (ORFs) in an ambisense organization with an intergenic region containing a predicted hairpin between the ORFs. Deduced amino acid (aa) and nt sequences from the four isolates were compared to those of other representative mammarenaviruses. An aa sequence divergence of &gt;25% for the nucleoprotein (NP) was found between the Thai isolates and all other known mammarenavirus species, whilst a 3.5\u201312.7% aa sequence divergence was found between the Cambodian isolates and W\u0113nzh\u014du virus (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). PAirwise Sequence Comparison (PASC) was performed on both segments for each of the four sequenced viruses. All samples were found most closely related to W\u0113nzh\u014du virus, with the Cambodian virus demonstrating 88.5\u201388.8% identity for the S segment and 86.0\u201386.3% identity for the L segment, whilst the Thai virus showed 70.3\u201370.6% identity for the S segment and 62.7\u201363.1% identity for the L segment (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Table 2\u2014source data 1</a>). The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) arenavirus species demarcation criteria includes, among others, the association with a main host species or group of sympatric hosts, presence in a defined geographical area, and significant protein amino acid sequence differences, including a difference of at least 12% in the amino acid (aa) sequence of the nucleoprotein to other species in the genus (<a href=\"#bib26\">King et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Radoshitzky et al., 2015</a>). A recent update from the ICTV <i>Arenaviridae</i> study group has also recommended the use of the PASC tool for the assessment of novel arenaviruses. Cut-off values chosen for classifying arenaviruses belonging to the same species using this tool are &gt;80% and &gt;76% nucleotide sequence identity in the S and L segments respectively (<a href=\"#bib45\">Radoshitzky et al., 2015</a>). The Thai virus is the first mammarenavirus to be detected in <i>Bandicota</i> species and, alongside the Cambodian virus\u00a0is the first to be detected in this geographic region. As this virus also meets nucleoprotein amino acid sequence identities and PASC requirements, we propose that this Thai virus represents a member of a novel species. We suggest to call this novel virus <i>Loei River mammarenavirus</i> (after a river close to the site where it was detected) with the abbreviation LORV. Although the Cambodian virus is the first mammarenavirus to be associated with Pacific rats (<i>R. exulans</i>) and Cambodia is geographically distant to the Chinese region in which W\u0113nzh\u014du virus was originally detected, the sequence homology to W\u0113nzh\u014du virus and the association with rodents of a common host species (<i>R.</i> norvegicus), indicates that the Cambodian virus represents a genetic variant of <i>W\u0113nzh\u014du mammarenavirus</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2014</a>). We propose to provisionally name this variant Cardamones (after the chain of mountains near Veal Renh)."

Despite several attempts to obtain a culture isolates in tissue culture, including multiple passages, we were unable to propagate the Cambodian isolates in the cell lines available in our laboratory (Vero E6, MDCK, BHK), or in primary cell lines from lungs obtained from a Wistar laboratory rat. Experimental infections were therefore conducted using homogenised lung tissue from wild-caught RNA-positive animals to infect both Wistar laboratory rats and wild-caught or first generation Pacific rats captured in the Mondulkiri site. Male and female adult animals were used. Due to logistical limitations, parallel experiments were not conducted for LORV. Of 85 animals inoculated intraperitoneally with the Cardamones variant of W\u0113nzh\u014du virus-positive homogenate, 77 (64/68 Wistar laboratory rats; 13/17 Pacific rats) were successfully infected as measured by detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR in organs and/or seroconversion by IFA\u00a0and/or\u00a0ELISA (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>). Organs positive for W\u0113nzh\u014du virus (i.e. brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, bladder, peritoneum) varied between individuals (data not shown), with individuals tested usually demonstrating a generalised infection. Organs from randomly selected adult individuals collected between 3dpi and 22dpi or 28dpi for Wistar laboratory rats and Pacific rats respectively, were subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and copy number was determined. Copy numbers increased over time with high copy numbers (10<sup>8</sup>\u201310<sup>11</sup> cDNA copy/mg) detected in several organs from 7dpi in Pacific rats and 11dpi in Wistar laboratory rats. Specifically, high copy numbers were detected in the liver, spleen and lung of most individuals, with the latter suggesting the potential for respiratory transmission. Mammarenavirus RNA was detected in most inoculated Wistar laboratory rats killed between 3-56dpi (52/68 individuals) and Pacific rats killed between 3-37dpi (11/17 individuals), although no animals were tested beyond these time points. Mammarenaviruses are known to cause both acute and chronic infections in their rodent hosts <sup>17</sup> and the duration of infection observed here is comparative to that seen in experimental infections of the natural hosts of other mammarenaviruses (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fulhorst et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Walker et al., 1975</a>). However, as lung homogenates were used instead of titrated virus, the variability of the dose received by each animal may have impacted on the infection course, likely resulting in the variations and inconsistencies observed (<a href=\"#bib15\">Childs et al., 1993</a>)."

LCMV infection of house mice must occur shortly before or after mating in order for dams to transmit the virus to a high proportion of their pups (<a href=\"#bib48\">Skinner and Knight, 1974</a>). Therefore the absence of vertical transmission observed here could have been due to the late stage of gestation at which most dams were inoculated (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>), although vertical transmission has not been confirmed in all mammarenaviruses (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mills et al., 2007</a>)."

We therefore decided to establish if zoonotic transmission does occur and if it is associated with clinical disease by testing human clinical samples from eight different sources (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). In group 1, a total of 89/510 patients presenting with dengue-like and influenza-like syndromes but who tested negative for dengue and influenza infection (17.4%) tested positive for anti-arenavirus IgG. The mean age of positive patients was 13 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 10.4\u201315.6; range: 4 months to 70 years) which was not statistically different (p=0.06) from negative patients (mean age: 10.6 years; 95% CI: 9.6\u201311.6; range: 7 months to 65 years). The highest antibody prevalence was detected in the 6 to 10 year old age group (40.5%). There was no difference in the sex ratio between seropositive and seronegative patients (49.5% and 43%, respectively; p=0.29). The seroprevalence was particularly high in some villages of Kampong Cham province (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Seroconversions were observed in 7 young patients with undocumented fever or influenza-like illness (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). These patients had a mean age of 8.1 year (95% CI: 4.3\u201312; range: 3\u201316 years) with a sex ratio of 0.71, which were not significantly different to mammarenavirus negative patients with paired sera (mean age: 9.6 years; 95% CI: 8.2\u201310.9; range: 7 months to 65 years; p=0.67; sex ratio: 0.45; p=0.17). Intervals between the collection of the acute and the convalescent serum samples for these patients ranged between 2 and 15 days with a mean of 7.4 days (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1E</a>). Retrospective clinical data were available for two of these patients. The first case (S1) was a 3 year old boy who presented with fever (38\u00b0C), rhinorrhea and nausea. The second case (S2) was a 9 year old boy presenting with mild fever (37.5\u00b0C), headache, cough, rhinorrhoea, and nausea. Muscle pain, joint pain, rash and bleeding were absent in both cases. Only fever (37.5\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C) was recorded in the five remaining cases (S3-7). Of note, self-treatment with antipyretics is extremely common in Cambodia and therefore the temperature measured at the time of medical examination is often normal. In addition to clinical patients, 529 samples from healthy individuals from Kampong Cham province who participated in a community-based dengue seroprevalence study (group 2) were also screened for anti-mammarenavirus IgG antibodies and 70 (13.23%) were found positive (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). The mean age of positive individuals was 10.71 (95% CI: 9.76\u201311.67; range: 1.1\u201319 years) with a sex ratio 0.47. The positivity rate and mean age of positive cases in healthy individuals compared to patients presenting with dengue-like and influenza-like symptoms were not significantly different (p=0.059 and p=0.09, respectively). A limited number of human samples (Total = 372, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>) were tested by both mammarenavirus IFA and IgG ELISA, demonstrating in general consistent results (coefficient of correlation of 0.565 with a p&lt;0.001). The comparison those two assays is only indicative as the tests were used for different purposes, due to different properties. IFA was chosen for screening purposes because of the ability of the test to detect antibodies directed against a wide range of arenaviruses while the ELISA was developed with the nucleoprotein of the Cardamones variant of W\u0113nzh\u014du virus is order to increase the specificity of the serology. Indeed, the W\u0113nzh\u014du virus IgG ELISA was tested against LCMV positive human sera, the only other zoonotic mammarenavirus currently presumed to be present in Southeastern\u00a0Asia, but no serological cross-reaction was observed.\u00a0The IgG ELISA seemed to be slightly more sensitive than the mammarenavirus IFA, detecting 11 additional positive samples (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>). The mammarenavirus IFA identified 2 samples found negative by the IgG ELISA as positive. However these infections may have been caused by more distantly related viruses, such as LCMV, not capable of detection by the more specific IgG ELISA. Despite\u00a0this, as mammarenaviruses are notoriously serologically cross-reactive by ELISA (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fukushi et al., 2012</a>) it is unlikely that this assay is perfectly specific to W\u0113nzh\u014du virus. Instead it is likely that this test would be capable of detecting other closely related arenaviruses, including novel species. However antisera to other arenaviruses were not available for testing. As for most serological assays, the precise causative agent in these seropositive patients can therefore not be identified conclusively."

Case 2 was a 9 year-old male with no known underlying disease sampled 2 days after onset of fever associated with cough, rhinorrhea, nausea, vomiting and severe headache. Case 3 was a 31 year-old male farmer, who presented 2 days after the onset of fever associated with productive cough, rhinorrhea, nausea and severe headache. Case 4 was a 45 year-old female farmer sampled 1 day after onset of fever associated with productive cough, rhinorrhea, nausea, severe headache and muscle pain. None of these 4 patients reported other signs and symptoms often associated with influenza (otalgia, sore throat) or dengue (rash, retro-orbital pain, joint pain, bleeding). Hospitalization was not required in any of these cases. In group 6 the first case (case 5) was that of an 8 month-old female with a recent history of fever (&lt;4 days) who presented to hospital with fever (38\u00b0C), productive cough, cardiac frequency at 130bpm, respiratory rate at 46/min, dyspnea and wheezing. The blood cell count performed at admission demonstrated anaemia (haemoglobin: 93\u00a0g/L), a normal white cell count and formula (leucocytes: 12.6x10<sup>9</sup>/L, lymphocytes: 5.2x10<sup>9</sup>/L, neutrophils: 5.7 10<sup>9</sup>/L). There was no liver cytolysis (SGOT: 46 U/L; normal value: 5\u201340 U/L, SGPT: 33 U/L; normal value: 5\u201350 U/L), the creatinine was normal (40\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) as was glycaemia (5.0\u00a0mmol/L). The chest radiograph which was retrospectively reviewed by an expert pulmonologist was normal and the final clinical diagnosis was of an acute bronchiolitis of probable viral origin. The patient received amoxicillin, gentamicin and bronchodilators for 4 days and was discharged after full recovery. The second hospitalized case (case 6) was a 3 month-old boy, admitted with a history of fever but with a normal body temperature at the time of medical examination, associated with productive cough, cardiac frequency of 132bpm, respiratory rate of 50/min, dyspnea and wheezing. The blood cell count (haemoglobin: 112\u00a0g/L, leucocytes: 11.6x10<sup>9</sup>/L, lymphocytes: 7.2x10<sup>9</sup>/L, neutrophils: 2.4x10<sup>9</sup>/L) and renal function (creatinine: 47\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) were normal for the patient\u2019s age. A hypoglycaemia of 2.8\u00a0mmol/L was reported. SGOT and SGPT were at 53 U/L and 44 U/L, respectively. The independent expert pulmonologist who reviewed the chest radiograph retrospectively described patchy infiltrates and confirmed the initial diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis of probable viral origin made by the hospital paediatrician. The patient fully recovered and was discharged after 3 days of treatment with bronchodilators, amoxicillin and gentamicin. In both of the hospitalised cases a rhinovirus was also detected in the nasopharyngeal swab samples, but it should be noted that rhinovirus infection is not always associated with symptomatic disease (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buecher et al., 2010</a>)."

Nevertheless, probably because of the limited sample sizes, the difference remained statistically significant only in adults over 30 years of age when the analysis was stratified by age groups (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>). Direct sequencing of the 302bp amplicons of L gene obtained from three of these six respiratory specimens identified W\u0113nzh\u014du virus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) with a 98\u201399% similarity to the strain detected in rodents from Veal Renh and 88.9\u201391% with W\u0113nzh\u014du virus isolated in China. Based on the absence of contamination of negative controls, and because 2 to 10 nucleotides differences were identified between the patient sequences and those of the positive control of rodent origin (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1I</a>), the positive patient samples are extremely unlikely to be a result of cross-contamination. In addition, the respiratory samples from 2 patients who tested positive by the screening nested RT-PCR were also tested by a qRT-PCR that targets a totally different region of the L gene (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>) and both samples tested positive with a viral load of\u00a0200 and 350 equivalent cDNA copies per reaction, respectively\u00a0(or 17,900 and 30,600 copies/ml of sample in virus transport medium). All the 6 patients were additionally tested for 17 common respiratory viruses by RT-PCR (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buecher et al., 2010</a>) and co-infections were detected in three out of six patients presenting with respiratory symptoms. The clinical data recorded for these patients (cases 1\u20136) are described in <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>. All the human mammarenavirus cases detected by molecular methods originated from Kampong Cham province. Although a total of 19 villages of the Kampong Cham province were included in the community-based study that comprised group 5, all the 4 cases detected in sub-group 5a originated from Krasang Pul village (KP) and were obtained between January and July 2009. Of note, patients from KP were over-represented (32%) amongst the total number of patients tested in sub-group 5a. The two individuals found mammarenavirus positive in group 6 were from two other villages, Roung Kou (RK) and Ampil Kraom (AK), in Kampong Cham province, both of which are situated approximately 8 km distant from KP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This, in conjunction with the relatively high mammarenavirus seropositivity rates also observed in this province (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), suggests that another focus of W\u0113nzh\u014du virus exists here."

The identification of the latter virus in Cambodia in individuals of <i>R. exulans</i> sympatric to infected individuals of the known host, <i>R. norvegicus</i>, expands both the geographic and host range of this mammarenavirus species. Although LCMV was not identified in this study (probably due to the absence of its host the house mouse from large regions of Southeastern Asia (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aplin et al., 2003</a>) and the study sites in particular) it is also proposed to have an Asian origin (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albari\u00f1o et al., 2010</a>). Despite this shared geographic heritage, both W\u0113nzh\u014du virus and LORV appear to be more closely related to the African LASV/IPPYV group viruses. This is also surprising from the viewpoint of the rodent-mammarenavirus co-evolution hypothesis. Based on this hypothesis a closer relationship would be expected between LASV/IPPYV and LCMV, since the rodent hosts (<i>Arvicanthis, Mastomys</i> and <i>Praomys</i> species) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Childs et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lecompte et al., 2005</a>) of the African mammarenaviruses are more closely related to <i>Mus</i> spp. than they are to the Asian Rattini tribe (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lecompte et al., 2008</a>). As such this finding alongside the recent discovery of divergent arenaviruses in boid snakes (recently classified as reptarenaviruses, the sister genus to mammarenaviruses) and more in depth analyses of rodent-mammarenavirus relationships, suggest that the history of the family <i>Arenaviridae</i> is more complex and the theory of co-evolution less robust than initially thought (<a href=\"#bib16\">Coulibaly-N'Golo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Irwin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stenglein et al., 2012</a>)."

In addition, the successful experimental infection and transmission of W\u0113nzh\u014du virus in rodents of two of the proposed host species, alongside the detection of this virus in rodents of several <i>Rattus</i> spp. from two geographically remote locations (<a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2014</a>), support their status as the reservoir hosts. Due to the relative host specificity of mammarenaviruses, confirmation of the host species of each of these viruses has important implications for their geographic distributions. Many of the species in which W\u0113nzh\u014du virus or LORV have been detected are widely distributed (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aplin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ruedi et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wodzicki and Taylor, 1984</a>). Rodents of these species are also associated with either agriculture (<i>Bandicota</i> spp.) or urban settings (<i>Rattus</i> spp.) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aplin et al., 2003</a>) and as such are likely to be among the few species that may benefit from urbanisation and agricultural intensification. This could ultimately result in increases in both the distribution of their viruses and in their opportunities for zoonotic transmission."

Like LORV, JUNV is associated with agricultural pest species (<a href=\"#bib11\">Busch et al., 2000</a>), whilst W\u0113nzh\u014du virus, LASV and LCMV are all hosted by rodents with a preference for human dwellings (<a href=\"#bib35\">McCormick et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Pocock et al., 2004</a>). This association with highly utilised human habitats indicates that humans are potentially exposed to both viruses on a regular basis as suggested by the relatively high seroprevalence observed in both the patient and the control group. Therefore, the identification of human W\u0113nzh\u014du virus infection is perhaps unsurprising from an epidemiological viewpoint, but nevertheless, represents the first detection of human mammarenavirus infection in Asia. The results from this study suggest that human infection with W\u0113nzh\u014du virus, or a closely related virus, occurs widely throughout Cambodia, and may possibly result in disease in some cases."

Although virus was never detected in healthy individuals and all patients with confirmed W\u0113nzh\u014du virus infections experienced similar symptoms of acute febrile bronchitis, the non-detection of co-infecting agents in three cases despite extensive testing does not mean that other untested or unknown pathogens were not present. However the clinical picture observed was similar to that reported for milder LCMV infection (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baum et al., 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Knust et al., 2014</a>). If like LCMV, W\u0113nzh\u014du virus rarely causes distinctive severe disease, then despite the high apparent incidence of the infection indicated by the retrospective serological study, causality is unlikely to be confirmed without further surveys."

A major one was our lack of success in isolating both Cardamones variant of W\u0113nzh\u014du virus and LORV in tissue culture. This was surprising as samples clearly contained viable virus as evidenced by successful experimental infection of rats. It was also inhibitive to downstream analyses, as a successful method of isolation could greatly aid in the development of serological tests and in confirming proof of causality in suspected cases of human disease. The reasons behind our inability to isolate these viruses are unknown. It is possible that the viruses may have replicated too slowly to be detected by the methods used but this seems unlikely based on the successful isolation of other arenaviruses under similar conditions (<a href=\"#bib23\">G\u00f3mez et al., 2011</a>). More likely is the possibility that samples contained viral titres that were too low for successful isolation in the cell lines tested (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lednicky et al., 2012</a>) or that cell lines were contaminated with Mycoplasma. Isolation attempts were made in cell lines previously used to culture other mammarenaviruses (e.g. Vero, MDCK, BHK), but as W\u0113nzh\u014du virus was isolated in canine macrophage DH82 cell line (<a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2014</a>), it would be prudent to attempt isolation in this cell line in the future. A serological test highly specific to W\u0113nzh\u014du virus is also needed. As such, the specificity of the ELISA test developed during this study needs to be assessed against other mammarenaviruses and potentially optimised further, or an alternative strategy employed. In order to strengthen the case for W\u0113nzh\u014du virus as an agent of human disease, future surveys would ideally include a comparison of the seroprevalence in exposed and non-exposed populations, using such a W\u0113nzh\u014du virus-specific test. Although attempts were made during this study to obtain sera from individuals not native to the Southeastern Asian region, only limited samples were available. Many of these were from individuals who had been resident in this region for some time and therefore may have been exposed to Southeastern Asian mammarenaviruses. Sourcing and testing of sera from non-endemic areas is therefore needed. Studies aimed at detecting seroconversion in conjunction with molecular testing for viral RNA are also required, with the ultimate goal of isolating the virus in tissue culture or rodents. If W\u0113nzh\u014du virus does cause disease, it is also possible that like LASV and LCMV, more severe disease may occur in particular individuals such as pregnant women and immuno-compromised individuals (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bonthius, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Price et al., 1988</a>) and this too should be examined."

However it is clear that many of the pathogenic agents responsible still remain undiagnosed, even when they are associated with potentially life threatening conditions. To improve protection we need a better understanding of both the ecology and epidemiology of diseases if we are to succeed in preventing them. Our findings illustrate how a 'One Health' approach in a regional hot-spot for emerging infectious disease can lead to the detection and characterisation of viruses likely associated with previously unrecognized human infections."

In order to do this, the nucleoprotein gene of this virus (GenBank accession number KC669696) was cloned into the plasmid pIVEX-MBP, and transformed in BL21 AI E. coli. After incubation and cell lysis, the lysate was purified by IMAC (Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography; HisPur Cobalt Resin and purification kit, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA) to separate the fusion protein, (NP-ARV), from the host proteins. The fusion protein was cut at the TEV site, and a second IMAC purification was used to separate NP-ARV from 6His-MBP and 6His-TEV. SDS-PAGE demonstrated that NP-ARV was in the non retained fraction and that the purity was 83.3%. The protein was then concentrated on cellulose membrane (Amicon, Millipore) to a final concentration of 0.8\u00a0mg/ml. To obtain monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), BALB/c mice were immunized six times subcutaneously with 10\u00a0\u00b5g of purified NP-ARV antigen.

Whilst I am not an expert in the laboratory aspects described, the successful experimental infection of animals using lung tissue that was positive for arenavirus RNA and the accompanying RT-PCR, serology and electron microscopy findings support the conclusion that the wild rodents were infected with an arenavirus. The virus is termed Cardamones virus in the manuscript but it is unclear that the virus represents a novel strain deserving of a new name. The failure to culture the virus is disappointing and the potential reasons for this require some discussion."

Since serology results are a large component of the evidence for human infections with an arenavirus, more supportive data on the specificity of the serological assay would be helpful. Seroepidemiological surveys of novel viruses should ideally compare the seroprevalence in exposed populations to the seroprevalance in populations who have likely not been exposed to the animal reservoir and should report efforts to validate the assay in virologically-confirmed cases. The limitations of the validation of the specificity of the ELISA should be addressed in more detail and more clarity about the serology methods would be helpful:"

Alongside the other species demarcation criteria stipulated by the ICTV, PASC analysis of Loei River virus indicates that this virus represents a novel mammarenavirus. PASC analysis of the Cambodian virus suggests that this virus belongs to the same species as W\u0113nzh\u014du virus, and this is supported by nucleoprotein amino acid sequence identities (&lt;12%). However, as the identities between the Chinese and Cambodian sequences were relatively low by intra-species standards and because they were identified in geographically distinct regions, we propose that the Cambodian sequences represent a variant of W\u0113nzh\u014du virus, with the proposed name Cardamones. The name Cardamones virus has been replaced with W\u0113nzh\u014du virus throughout the text, or referred to as the Cardamones variant of W\u0113nzh\u014du virus. Although the Cardamones variant was identified in rodents of a species (<i>R. exulans</i>) not previously associated with W\u0113nzh\u014du virus, in addition to rodents of the species <i>R. norvegicus</i>, which has been, we don\u2019t believe this supports the case for the Cardamones virus as a separate species. The previous study by Li et al., 2014 demonstrated that W\u0113nzh\u014du virus is clearly capable of infecting rodents of a range of species, including several <i>Rattus</i> species, so it\u2019s presence in another one that is sympatric to <i>R. norvegicus</i> fits well with its seemingly promiscuous nature. The PASC results and discussion around the categorization of the Cambodian virus have been included in the Results and Discussion (see also <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Table 2\u2014source data 1</a>) and the reference to the ICTV requirements updated as suggested."
