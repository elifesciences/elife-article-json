However, the translational dynamics that link steady-state mRNA with protein levels are not well understood. In this study, we bridge this disconnect by measuring genome-wide translation using ribosome profiling, through five stages of the <i>P. falciparum</i> blood phase developmental cycle. Our findings show that transcription and translation are tightly coupled, with overt translational control occurring for less than 10% of the transcriptome. Translationally regulated genes are predominantly associated with merozoite egress functions. We systematically define mRNA 5\u2032 leader sequences, and 3\u2032 UTRs, as well as antisense transcripts, along with ribosome occupancy for each, and establish that accumulation of ribosomes on 5\u2032 leaders is a common transcript feature. This work represents the highest resolution and broadest portrait of gene expression and translation to date for this medically important parasite."

However, the translational dynamics that link steady-state mRNA with protein levels are not well understood. In this study, we bridge this disconnect by measuring genome-wide translation using ribosome profiling, through five stages of the <i>P. falciparum</i> blood phase developmental cycle. Our findings show that transcription and translation are tightly coupled, with overt translational control occurring for less than 10% of the transcriptome. Translationally regulated genes are predominantly associated with merozoite egress functions. We systematically define mRNA 5\u2032 leader sequences, and 3\u2032 UTRs, as well as antisense transcripts, along with ribosome occupancy for each, and establish that accumulation of ribosomes on 5\u2032 leaders is a common transcript feature. This work represents the highest resolution and broadest portrait of gene expression and translation to date for this medically important parasite."

The apparent lack of dynamic transcriptional regulation suggested that complementary post-transcriptional mechanisms could play an important role in the regulation of parasite gene expression (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hughes et al., 2010</a>). This is a reasonable assumption, given that global or gene-specific translational regulation of gene expression is a mechanism that allows fast adaptations during drastic changes in environmental conditions as well as during rapid transitions in developmental programs. Indeed a few examples of translational control in <i>Plasmodium</i> have been reported. In sporozoites present in the mosquito salivary gland, phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 by the kinase IK2, inhibits translation and causes accumulation of mRNAs into granules. Translational repression is alleviated by eIF2\u03b1 phosphatase during the transition into the mammalian host, allowing parasites to transform into the liver stages (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). Similarly, PK4 kinase activity leads to the reduction of global protein synthesis through phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in schizonts and gametocytes and is essential for the completion of the parasite's erythrocytic cycle (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). Gene-specific translational regulation has also been observed in <i>P. falciparum</i> and is mediated by cis-acting sequences in combination with RNA-binding proteins. For example, dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) binds within the coding region of its own cognate mRNA to repress translation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zhang and Rathod, 2002</a>) and antifolate treatment has been shown to relieve this repressive effect without alteration of mRNA levels (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nirmalan et al., 2004a</a>). In <i>Plasmodium berghei,</i> storage of translationally repressed mRNAs prior to fertilization is mediated by mRNA binding via the RNA helicase DOZI and the Sm-like factor CITH (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mair et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2010</a>). Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) found on 5\u2032 UTRs of transcripts have been reported to regulate the translation of specific genes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Morris and Geballe, 2000</a>). In <i>P. falciparum</i>, the only uORF described and functionally characterized to date is a 120 codon region upstream of the <i>var2csa</i> (PFL0030c) coding region, a unique variant of the surface antigen PfEMP1 that mediates adhesion to placenta in pregnant women (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amulic et al., 2009</a>). In this case, translation of the uORF modulates repression of var2csa translation. Aside from these examples, the extent to which global and gene-specific translational control operates in <i>P. falciparum</i> during the IDC remains sparse."

Parallel mass spectrometry-based proteomics and genome-wide expression profiling revealed differences between mRNA abundance and the accumulation of the corresponding protein, supporting the notion that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is at play in this parasite (<a href=\"#bib28\">Le Roch et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Nirmalan et al., 2004b</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Foth et al., 2011</a>). These methods, however, are limited in their ability to measure low abundance proteins and do not capture the underlying relationship between transcriptional activity and translational efficiency. More recently, polysome profiling was used to monitor discrepancies between polysome-associated and steady-state mRNAs in 30% of the <i>P. falciparum</i> blood stage transcriptome (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bunnik et al., 2013</a>); however, this approach does not reveal the precise localization of the ribosomes, and thus can not be used to accurately assess the translational efficiency of a given mRNA (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ingolia, 2014</a>)."

We demonstrate that the data are highly reproducible, and we find that the translational efficiency of the majority of mRNAs expressed follows a narrow distribution, exhibiting a tight coupling between transcription and translation. Only 10% of the genes expressed deviate from this trend and are translationally up- or down-regulated. We found a surprising amount of ribosome density associated with 5\u2032 leaders of transcripts particularly in genes with functions associated with merozoite egress and invasion. Overall, the precision and depth of the dataset presented herein add significantly to our understanding of <i>P. falciparum</i> gene expression by linking transcriptional and translational dynamics throughout the blood stages."

(2009)</a>. Ribosome profiling is based on the deep sequencing of ribosome protected mRNA fragments obtained by nuclease digestion of polysomes, cycloheximide-arrested ribosomes bound to mRNA. These fragments represent the exact location of the ribosome at the moment the sample was harvested. Five stages representative of the 48-hr IDC of <i>P. falciparum</i> were harvested for both mRNA and polysome isolation; ring, early trophozoite, late trophozoite, schizont stages, and purified merozoites. To assess the reproducibility of the data, we harvested independent biological replicates of each stage. Polysomes were isolated in the presence of the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide, then nuclease digested to produce monosomes, and sedimented by centrifugation on a sucrose gradient (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To minimize isolation of RNA fragments bound by proteins other than 80S ribosomes, RNA was extracted only from the fractions of the sucrose gradient containing the monosome peak. The resulting \u223c30 nt fragments of RNA, corresponding to ribosome footprints, were processed into strand-specific deep sequencing libraries in parallel with the mRNA samples, fragmented to \u223c30 nt for consistency. Despite the unusually high AT content of the <i>P. falciparum</i> genome, over 92% of all 30 nt sequenced reads, derived from coding sequences (CDSs), mapped uniquely to the genome (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

                                "text": "While RNA-Seq reveals the abundance and architecture of individual mRNAs, ribosome profiling provides a complementary and quantitative measure of mRNA translation. Ribosome occupancy along the CDS results in a profile that indicates the timing and magnitude of translation of a given mRNA, thus quantitatively delineating regions of each mRNA molecule that are actually bound by 80S ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>). To inspect translation on a genome-wide scale, ribosome density values of each gene expressed in the data set were organized in the same order as the transcriptome. The translational profile of each gene displayed a cascade-like quality strikingly similar to the transcriptome (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Much like mRNA abundance, translation of phasic genes reaches a single maximum and a single minimum during the IDC. To determine the exact level of correlation between transcription and translation, we directly compared mRNA and ribosome footprint density measurements (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In general, translation is tightly correlated with transcription for all phasic and non-phasic genes in rings (<i>r</i> = 0.85), early trophozoites (<i>r</i> = 0.93), late trophozoites (<i>r</i> = 0.91), schizonts (<i>r</i> = 0.89), and purified merozoites (<i>r</i> = 0.86). This indicates that when an mRNA is detected in one stage it is associated proportionally with ribosomes within the same stage. An example pair of genes is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. Here, mRNA abundance profiles of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 gamma subunit (PF14_0104) and the conserved protein PF14_0105, show that peak mRNA abundance for these two genes occurs at two different stages, early and late, respectively. Examination of ribosome occupancy of both genes reveals a ribosome density accumulation profile within the coding sequence that mirrors their respective mRNA profiles. As for the majority of genes, ribosome footprint density and mRNA abundance for these two genes are highly correlated (<i>r</i> = 0.98 and 0.93 for PF14_0104 and PF14_0105, respectively), indicating that mRNA translation occurs proportionally during the same stages at which these genes are transcribed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Globally, 77% of genes expressed in at least three stages of the IDC display high Pearson correlation (<i>r</i> \u2265 0.7) between mRNA abundance and translation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, our genome-wide analysis of translation establishes that for the majority of genes expressed during the IDC, transcription and translation occur proportionally."

The ratio of the footprint rpkM to the mRNA rpkM for any given gene represents its relative translational efficiency (TE) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>).

The shape and the range of TE distributions obtained for each stage sampled is comparable to those seen in other eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dunn et al., 2013</a>). Absolute mean translational efficiencies in all stages (log<sub>2</sub>TE \u00b5<sub>Rings</sub> = \u22120.43, log<sub>2</sub>TE \u00b5<sub>E.trophs.</sub> = \u22120.56, log<sub>2</sub>TE \u00b5<sub>L.trophs</sub>. = \u22120.31, log<sub>2</sub>TE \u00b5<sub>Schizonts</sub> = \u22120.16 and log<sub>2</sub>TE \u00b5<sub>Merozoites</sub> = \u22120.68) had a maximum difference of 1.47-fold observed between early trophozoites and schizonts. Translational efficiencies display a roughly 100-fold range in absolute values in each of the stages with the exception of the ring and merozoite stages, which exhibit more extreme values. In these stages, the distribution of absolute TE values displays an approximately fourfold larger spread than in early trophozoites, late trophozoites, or schizonts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>).

For the purpose of this analysis, genes with a translational efficiency of two standard deviations above or below the mean in any of the stages were considered translationally up- or down-regulated, respectively. A total of 301 genes, 8.3% of the transcriptome, are translationally regulated by this metric, with 124 genes translationally down-regulated and 177 genes translationally up-regulated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). The timing of maximum mRNA expression does not influence TE for either of these two groups. Translational efficiencies remain high for the translationally up-regulated and low for the translationally down-regulated genes in all the stages at which they are expressed, regardless of the stage of peak mRNA abundance, suggesting that translational efficiency is largely, but not completely, programmed by the mRNA sequence itself, rather than global factors. For example, translational efficiency of the merozoite surface protein 6 (MSP6, PF10_0346) remains high (log<sub>2</sub>TE \u2265 2) across all stages irrespective of variations in its mRNA abundance. In contrast TE values for the eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha kinase 1 (IK1, PF14_0423) are among the lowest measured despite high mRNA abundance across all stages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

Within the limits imposed by our data, we were able to describe 5\u2032 mRNA leaders and/or 3\u2032 UTRs for 3569 genes in at least one of the stages (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). 5\u2032 leaders are on average longer than 3\u2032 UTRs in each of the stages and median lengths across stages vary to a larger degree for 5\u2032 leaders (from 607 to 1040 nt) than for 3\u2032 UTRs (518\u2013622 nt). The longest 5\u2032 mRNA leader was measured in late trophozoites (8229 nt) for the Ap2 transcription factor, PF11_0404, and the longest 3\u2032 UTR stretched 4773 nt for 60S ribosomal protein L7-3, PF14_0231, in rings. An example pair of genes with mapped 5\u2032 leaders and 3\u2032 UTRs is shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. Here, our HMM predicts a 636 nt and a 781 nt 5\u2032 leader and a 468 nt and 423 nt 3\u2032 UTR for the Myb2 transcription factor (PF10_0327) and the bromodomain protein (PF10_0328), respectively. These genes, encoded on opposite strands, share a 1536-nt intergenic sequence; however, the span between the region delimited by their 5\u2032 leader sequence is only 120 nt and presumably harbors their respective promoters."

More than 80% of the ribosome footprints in rings, early trophozoites, late trophozoites, and schizonts, were mapped to CDS regions of the genome, except in merozoites, where only 68% were mapped to the CDS (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). On average less than 1% of all reads obtained were mapped to 3\u2032 UTRs in each stage, and most transcripts had no observed footprints past the stop codon. In contrast, footprints were far more common in 5\u2032 leaders (9.1%, 4.8%, 7.5%, and 4.8% in rings, early trophozoites, late trophozoites, and schizonts, respectively) particularly in merozoites (23%). Footprint enrichment is specific to 5\u2032 leaders and not due to non-specific background since this would result in an increase of footprints mapping evenly along the length of the transcript, including the 3\u2032 UTR, and not just the 5\u2032 leader. Furthermore, these footprints most likely represent ribosomes because they derive from the 80S monosome fraction of the sucrose gradient, and their footprint read length distributions are equal to those of CDS mapping footprints, whereas they are significantly divergent from rRNA or tRNA read length distributions (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We systematically searched for transcripts for which coverage, in a sliding window of 30 nt, was greater in the 3\u2032 UTR than the CDS, and found 19 genes meeting this criterion. These genes could be qualitatively divided into two categories: 14 with putative stop codon read-through and/or alternate stop codon usage and 5 genes for which the origin of the 3\u2032 UTR density is unclear (listed in <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1</a>). An example of stop codon read-through is the conserved plasmodium protein (PF13_0160), shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>. Ribosomes not only extend beyond the annotated stop codon of this transcript but also skip subsequent in-frame stop codons present on the predicted 644 nt 3\u2032 UTR. Interestingly, ribosome footprints accumulate in a single large peak approximately 130 nt downstream of the annotated stop codon. On the 1290 nt 3\u2032 UTR of the sodium-dependent phosphate transporter (MAL13P1.206), two large peaks of ribosome footprint density, one approximately 560 nt and the other 860 nt from the stop codon, can be observed (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). The origin of these footprints is unclear, and it is possible that these are the product of nuclease protection by RNA-binding proteins that co-sediment with the 80S monosome. To confirm that 3\u2032 UTR mapping reads are derived from ribosome footprints, we compared their cumulative read length distributions against a typical CDS footprint read length distribution (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For the 16 of the 19 genes we observed no significant difference in footprint size distributions localized to the CDS compared with the 3\u2032 UTR. For the remaining three genes, the sodium-dependent phosphate transporter (MAL13P1.206), the acyl-Coa synthetase (PFD0085c), and the conserved plasmodium protein (PF13_0160), 3\u2032 UTR footprint size distributions were divergent from those on the CDS, implying that footprints found on these genes' 3\u2032 UTRs may be produced by nuclease protection of these regions by factors other than ribosomes that co-sediment with 80S ribosomes."

Synthesized proteins are likely to exert their functions immediately upon translation but post-translational regulation, not captured by our data, could still be at play. Direct correlations of translational efficiencies measured in this study along with proteomic data sets are hampered by the reduced sensitivity of the latter and differences in temporal resolution and staging of the parasites between data sets. However, the available proteomic evidence is largely consistent with the results presented here, particularly for highly translated proteins. The simultaneous capture of mRNA abundance and translation is expected to be a more accurate proxy for protein levels than measurements of mRNA abundance alone (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>) and provides a critical resource for the identification of instances of post-translational regulation of gene expression.

We find 177 translationally up-regulated genes with functions predominantly related to merozoite egress and invasion, with peak mRNA in schizonts and peak translational efficiency in rings. It is likely that the genes with unknown functions, regulated in an analogous way during the merozoite to ring transition, are also associated with this process. Our data support a model whereby the transcripts of proteins necessary for merozoite structure and function are made in the previous stage in large abundance, are translationally up-regulated during the invasion process, and remain highly translated well into the ring stage despite rapid mRNA decay during this stage (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shock et al., 2007</a>). Whether the accumulation of 5\u2032 leader ribosome density is a mechanism that assists in this process or is it merely a byproduct of more efficient ribosomal initiation on these templates remains to be tested. With the emergence of genome editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ghorbal et al., 2014</a>), it may be possible to create versions of genes with altered cis-acting sequences to test for modulation of 5\u2032 ribosome density and its effect on translational efficiency."

For comparison, in yeast under starvation conditions the fraction of ribosome footprints derived from 5\u2032 leaders is increased by sixfold and in some cases no single uORF can account for the entire distribution of ribosomes on the 5\u2032 leader of a gene (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>), much like <i>P. falciparum</i>. What mechanism could account for global ribosome accumulation in the 5\u2032 leader? The presence of apparent 80S ribosomes within the 5\u2032 leader sequence, regardless of whether they cover uORFs or not, suggests an engagement mode in which the fidelity of start codon recognition is altered or suspended. Current models propose that the 43S pre-initiation complex loads onto the mRNA with the assistance of other initiation factors near the 5\u2032 cap and proceeds to scan down the length of the mRNA until it encounters an AUG codon. This is followed by the assembly of the 48S preinitiation complex and then finally the 80S complex (for review, see <a href=\"#bib20\">Hinnebusch, 2011</a>). The AUG that is ultimately chosen is not always the first one encountered, and its sequence context is important for recognition. The factors eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF5 have been implicated in recognition of the \u2018correct\u2019 AUG (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aitken and Lorsch, 2012</a>). In the case of <i>P. falciparum</i>, differential regulation or modification of these factors could plausibly result in altered start codon selection and 80S assembly. Whether prematurely initiated complexes are able to scan without synthesizing a peptide or are required to assemble and reassemble until encountering the right start codon remains an open question. Large 5\u2032 ribosome accumulation on translationally up-regulated genes in the ring stage suggests that premature initiation on these transcripts is not detrimental. The development of an in vitro translation system that recapitulates upstream 80S assembly on <i>P. falciparum</i> 5\u2032 leaders will allow direct testing of premature initiation and its effect on translational efficiency in this parasite."

In addition, the authors seek to enhance our understanding of how this regulatory strategy is enacted in this organism. Thus, this is a timely and potentially and important manuscript.

Whether these uORFs or other 5\u2019 leader motifs are responsible for the silencing of the downstream coding region remains an important question. Additionally, this gene presents the lowest ribosomal release score calculated, which strongly suggests that it is not being translated."

Previous studies found that 5\u2019UTRs of mRNAs encoding genes which need to be strongly and finely regulated are often longer than average (Kozak 1987; Hurowitz and Brown 2003; David et al. 2006; Nagalakshmi et al. 2008; Bruno et al. 2010). On the other hand, Lynch et al. (2005) proposed that the length of the 5\u2019UTR is driven mainly by random genetic drift and mutational processes that cause stochastic turnover in transcription-initiation sites and premature start codons, combined with a selective constrain against the premature initiation of translation. Additional sequencing and mapping of transcript architecture in other eukaryotes will help establish in the future whether or not <i>P. falciparum</i> truly lies at the extreme of the distribution."
