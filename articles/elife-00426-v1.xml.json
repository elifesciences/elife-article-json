Here, we demonstrate that the <i>Clock\u039419</i> mutant behavioral phenotype is significantly modified by mouse strain genetic background. We map a suppressor of the <i>Clock\u039419</i> mutation to a \u223c900 kb interval on mouse chromosome 1 and identify the transcription factor, <i>Usf1</i>, as the responsible gene. A SNP in the promoter of <i>Usf1</i> causes elevation of its transcript and protein in strains that suppress the <i>Clock</i> mutant phenotype. USF1 competes with the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex for binding to E-box sites in target genes. Saturation binding experiments demonstrate reduced affinity of the CLOCK\u039419:BMAL1 complex for E-box sites, thereby permitting increased USF1 occupancy on a genome-wide basis. We propose that USF1 is an important modulator of molecular and behavioral circadian rhythms in mammals."

Here, we demonstrate that the <i>Clock\u039419</i> mutant behavioral phenotype is significantly modified by mouse strain genetic background. We map a suppressor of the <i>Clock\u039419</i> mutation to a \u223c900 kb interval on mouse chromosome 1 and identify the transcription factor, <i>Usf1</i>, as the responsible gene. A SNP in the promoter of <i>Usf1</i> causes elevation of its transcript and protein in strains that suppress the <i>Clock</i> mutant phenotype. USF1 competes with the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex for binding to E-box sites in target genes. Saturation binding experiments demonstrate reduced affinity of the CLOCK\u039419:BMAL1 complex for E-box sites, thereby permitting increased USF1 occupancy on a genome-wide basis. We propose that USF1 is an important modulator of molecular and behavioral circadian rhythms in mammals."

Two members of the bHLH-PAS transcription factor family, CLOCK (and its paralog NPAS2) and BMAL1 (ARNTL), heterodimerize and initiate transcription of the <i>Period</i> (<i>Per1, Per2</i>) and <i>Cryptochrome</i> (<i>Cry1</i>, <i>Cry2</i>) genes through E-box regulatory sequences (<a href=\"#bib16\">King et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Gekakis et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hogenesch et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kume et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bunger et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). The resulting PER and CRY proteins form multimeric complexes, translocate to the nucleus, and abrogate their own transcription by repressing CLOCK:BMAL1 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lee et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Koike et al., 2012</a>). As the PER and CRY proteins are degraded, CLOCK:BMAL1 occupancy increases to initiate a new round of transcription (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Koike et al., 2012</a>).

We previously identified at least 13 loci in mice that affect circadian behavior through complex epistatic interactions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Shimomura et al., 2001</a>), indicating that there are other clock-relevant genes in the mammalian genome.

By western blot analysis, USF1 protein levels in the liver were \u223c40% higher in BALB animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). To test whether the suppressor strain activates E-box-containing circadian clock genes in vivo, we examined the effect of strain background (B6 or [BALB x B6]F1) on expression levels of <i>Per1, Per2, Cry1</i> and <i>Cry2</i> in liver using quantitative PCR (qPCR). We detected significant up-regulation of all four circadian genes tested in the F1 background (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), consistent with elevated expression of an E-box transcription factor such as USF1. Taken together these results strongly suggest that <i>Usf1</i> is a prime candidate gene for the <i>Soc</i> locus. Because there are no coding mutations in <i>Usf1</i> between the B6 and BALB mouse strains (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>), we hypothesized that the elevated expression of <i>Usf1</i> in the BALB suppressor strain is likely the cause of <i>Clock</i> suppression."

We chose an SNP at the 3\u2032-UTR of <i>Usf1</i> as a marker to distinguish between the B6 and BALB alleles. The amplicon size from genomic DNA and cDNA are identical. We PCR-amplified the SNP-containing region in genomic DNA samples from B6, BALB, (B6 x BALB)F1 and three samples containing different mix ratios between B6 and BALB DNA (3:1, 1:1 and 1:3, respectively) as shown in the left panel. The panel on the right shows (B6 x BALB)F1 <i>Usf1</i> cDNA sequence from hypothalamus (top three) and liver (lower three). The PCR products were sequenced by an ABI3700 machine to compare the fluorescent signal peak ratio at the SNP locus as an indicator of the copy number ratio of the two alleles. This clearly demonstrates that the expression difference of <i>Usf1</i> between B6 and BALB is the result of polymorphisms in <i>cis</i> regulatory elements. (<b>B</b>) Analysis of allele-specific expression differences between B6 and BALB <i>Usf1</i> mRNA by quantitative PCR. We amplified genomic DNA mixtures described in (<b>A</b>) with allele-specific PCR primers and created a standard curve for %BALB genomic DNA vs \u0394C<sub>t</sub> (black data points). The blue data point is from F1 genomic DNA, which is naturally a 1:1 mixture of B6 and BALB. Red data points represent F1 cDNA from hypothalamus. Based on the standard curve generated from genomic DNA, 80% of the F1 cDNA contains the BALB <i>Usf1</i> allele. (<b>C</b>) Analysis of allele-specific expression differences between B6 and BALB <i>Usf1</i> mRNA by cloning PCR products. We amplified both F1 genomic DNA and cDNA using primers flanking an SNP in exon 10 (rs31093636) of <i>Usf1</i>. We generated four independent PCR products from a single F1 genomic DNA sample and four PCR products from four different F1 cDNA samples. The exon 10 SNP creates a restriction fragment length polymorphism such that only the BALB allele is cleaved by restriction enzyme TfiI. Each PCR product was cloned into a TA plasmid vector. From each transformation, we picked 24\u201348 colonies. We isolated 143 colonies containing F1 genomic DNA and 172 colonies containing F1 cDNA. This analysis, like that in (<b>B</b>), demonstrates that the F1 cDNA contains a higher percentage of the BALB <i>Usf1</i> allele than expected. (<b>D</b>) <i>Usf1</i> promoter analysis between B6 and BALB mouse strains. The putative <i>Usf1</i> promoter sequence (\u223c2.3 kb upstream of exon 1) was cloned into the pGL4 luciferase reporter vector and 90 ng of either B6 or BALB construct was transfected into HEK293T cells. Promoter activity from the BALB clone is significantly higher than that from the B6 clone (p&lt;10<sup>\u22126</sup>). Next, we swapped EcoRI-XhoI fragments between the B6 and BALB constructs. The B6 clone containing the BALB EcoRI-XhoI fragment has significantly higher activity than the original B6 clone (p&lt;10<sup>\u22123</sup>). The activity is equivalent to the original BALB clone. On the other hand, the BALB clone containing the B6 EcoRI-XhoI fragment exhibits essentially similar activity as the B6 intact clone. The blue and green bars indicate B6 and BALB DNA fragments, respectively. Each data point represents mean \u00b1 SEM of 18\u201336 samples. (<b>E</b>) SNP distribution pattern among 16 mouse strains in the <i>Usf1</i> promoter candidate region. We detected 14 polymorphisms among 16 mouse strains within the \u223c1000 bp candidate region. The top eight strains are <i>Clock</i><sup><i>\u039419</i></sup> non-suppressor strains and the bottom eight are <i>Clock</i><sup><i>\u039419</i></sup> suppressor strains. There are only seven polymorphisms that perfectly match the phenotype distribution pattern. Blue indicates the B6 allele and green indicates the BALB allele. (<b>F</b>) Putative <i>Usf1</i> promoter SNPs (containing \u223c100 bp of flanking sequence of SNP1, SNP2, SNP3, SNP4, SNP5&amp;6 and SNP7) from B6 and BALB were cloned into the pGL4 luciferase reporter vector. Only SNP3 and SNP7 show elevated promoter activity. In both cases, the BALB allele has significantly higher activity (p&lt;0.001) than the B6 allele (p&lt;0.01). In the NCBI RefSNP database, SNP3 corresponds to rs31538551 and SNP7 to rs31538547. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SEM of six samples. (<b>G</b>) We mutagenized the B6 promoter EcoRI-XhoI fragment to introduce the BALB allele at either SNP3 or SNP7. We observed a significant increase in the luciferase signal by SNP7 (p&lt;0.05).

At all E-boxes, we detected three types of DNA:protein complexes: CLOCK:BMAL1 tandem heterodimers (CB2), CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers (CB1), and USF (consisting of USF1:USF1 and possibly USF1:USF2 or USF2:USF2 dimers). As shown previously, these E-box sites consist of tandem E-boxes spaced 6\u201310 nucleotides apart, and binding to these tandem sites appears to be cooperative (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Rey et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes bind primarily as a tandem complex (CB2) at all four E-box sites with the <i>Dbp</i> E<sub>P</sub> and <i>Per2</i> E\u2032 E-boxes showing the most bias towards tandem binding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). By contrast, the mutant CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 heterodimer binds primarily as a single complex (CB1) at all four sites. Antibody supershift experiments affected both the CB1 and CB2 complexes, consistent with the hypothesis that these complexes, whether containing mutant or wild-type CLOCK, represent single or tandem CLOCK:BMAL1 binding complexes, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

The binding of each of the complexes at the four E-boxes are presented as both absolute and relative binding plots to show both the relative amount of binding as well as the relative affinity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

Although the affinity varies depending on the specific site, K<sub>d</sub> values of wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 range from 0.86 nM for <i>Dbp</i> E<sub>I2</sub> to 19 nM for <i>Per1</i> E<sub>P1</sub>, while the K<sub>d</sub> of CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 ranges from 9 to 48 nM for <i>Dbp</i> E<sub>I2</sub> and <i>Per1</i> E<sub>P1</sub>, respectively (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

Parenthetically, these data also show that the affinity and maximal binding of CLOCK:BMAL1 vary widely among native E-box sites, thus it is important to base interpretations on more than one E-box site. There is no significant difference in USF1 binding affinity between the two genotypes and, in fact, the K<sub>d</sub> of USF1 is similar to the mutant CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 complex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>)."

In the case of the <i>Dbp</i> E<sub>I2</sub> site (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), where wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 binds both as single and tandem complexes, the tandem CB2 site has much higher affinity than CB1, consistent with the prediction of previous work (<a href=\"#bib25\">Rey et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, at the <i>Dbp</i> E<sub>P</sub> site (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), where mutant CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 complex can be seen binding as both single CB1 and tandem CB2 complexes, the affinities of the two mutant complexes are similar and lower than wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 complex. This suggests that the affinity of the mutant CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 complex is lower for two reasons: first, it does not preferentially bind as a tandem complex, thus binding may not be cooperative; and second, its affinity, even as a tandem complex, remains lower suggesting that the <i>Clock</i><sup><i>\u039419</i></sup> mutation interferes both with cooperativity and with affinity. Thus, our saturation binding experiments clearly demonstrate that the affinity of CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 is significantly lower relative to the wild-type complex, and that this lower affinity is similar to the affinity of USF1 at the same sites. This suggests that under normal conditions, the wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 complex binds with much higher affinity than the USF1 complex, but when mutant, the affinities of the CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 and USF1 complexes are comparable which allows USF1 to bind more effectively to E-box sites."

Furthermore quantitative analysis of binding kinetics indicates that the CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 complex has a much lower binding affinity for E-boxes than its wild-type counterpart. This lowered affinity combined with increased expression of USF1 in BALB mice accounts for the rescue of the <i>Clock</i><sup><i>\u039419</i></sup><i>/+</i> phenotype in this strain.

USF1 is ubiquitously expressed in both mouse and human and is a member of the evolutionarily conserved bHLH-Zip transcription factor family. USF1 participates in the regulation of several processes including lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, immune responses, and the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib5\">Corre and Galibert, 2005</a>). USF1 interacts with the circadian clock gene pathway by binding to E-box regulatory sites in common with those bound by CLOCK:BMAL1 to regulate circadian gene expression (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). We find that the mutant CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 complex binds with much lower affinity than wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes, arising in part from the absence of cooperativity of binding to tandem E-box sites seen with the wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 complex (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Because USF1 binds as a dimer, the 40% increase in USF1 levels observed in the <i>Clock</i> suppressor strain could lead to a substantial increase in DNA binding if those levels are below the K<sub>d</sub> for USF1 binding. In addition, because the PER:CRY negative feedback complex cannot repress USF1-mediated transactivation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), a modest increase in USF1 could activate target genes more effectively than CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1. Thus, USF1 can suppress the <i>Clock</i><sup><i>\u039419</i></sup> mutant by increased occupancy of CLOCK:BMAL1 E-box sites, acting as a partial agonist for CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated transcription. What might the role of USF1 be in a <i>Clock</i> wild-type background? We have found that as CLOCK:BMAL1 DNA binding decreases at night (<a href=\"#bib25\">Rey et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Koike et al., 2012</a>), USF1 occupancy increases at these sites, exhibiting an antiphase temporal DNA binding pattern (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We speculate that the role of USF1 at CLOCK:BMAL1 sites could be to maintain an open chromatin state to facilitate CLOCK:BMAL1 binding on the following circadian cycle although additional work would be required to test this hypothesis. In addition, in <i>Usf1</i> knockout mice, we observe a reduction in circadian amplitude and activity levels showing that USF1 plays a role under normal conditions to enhance circadian rhythmicity and robustness. While it is tempting to speculate that these effects of <i>Usf1</i> might work at the level of the cell autonomous circadian oscillator, additional experiments would be required to determine at what level of organization (cell, circuit or higher) these changes in amplitude at the behavioral level originate."

Thus, most tandem E-box sites are preferentially bound by wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 complex over USF1. (<b>C</b>) In contrast, in the <i>Clock</i><sup><i>\u039419</i></sup> mutant, the CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 complex binds to the E1 site primarily as a single heterodimer with an affinity similar to that of USF1, yet lower than that of the wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 tandem heterodimer complex. This allows USF1 to occupy CLOCK:BMAL1 sites more effectively in the mutant state and, as a consequence, drive transcription of CLOCK:BMAL1 target genes under conditions where mutant CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 is not transcriptionally competent. Because USF1 is not repressed by CRY1 or CRY2 negative feedback, the transcriptional activation by USF1 may be more responsive than that of CLOCK:BMAL1.

Gels (0.2 mm thickness, 4% polyacrylamide, Bio-Rad #161\u20130144) were run for 90 min at room temperature (7.5 V/cm) and exposed on phosphor imager screens for 18 hr at 4\u00b0C. For saturation binding assays, increasing amounts of probe were added to a fixed amount of nuclear extract in triplicate. A four-parameter nonlinear least squares curve fitting method (Prizm, Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used to estimate the B<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>d</sub> values and to conduct tests for whether each best-fit parameter differs among the four groups in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>."

The ROSAbetageo+1 gene trap vector (incorporating fused beta galactosidase and neomycin) was introduced to 129S2/SvPas-derived TBV2 embryonic stem (ES) cells to generate mutant cell lines. Both W233A07 and P116C05 cells, carrying a vector insertion into the intron one of <i>Usf1</i> gene, were used to generate mice which were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for four generations. In order to detect presence of trap vector, <i>Usf1</i>-TrapFwd: 5\u2032-AGTGACAACGTCGAGCACAG-3\u2032, <i>Usf1</i>-TrapRev: 5\u2032-CGGTCGCTACCATTACCAGT-3\u2032 were used. To discriminate +/\u2212 from \u2212/\u2212 mouse, we used real time PCR using <i>Usf1</i>-Trap 129Fwd:5\u2032- GGAGGTGGGGATTATAGTCTGAA-3\u2032, <i>Usf1</i>-Trap B6Fwd:5\u2032- GGAGGTGGGGATTATAGTCTGAG-3\u2032 and <i>Usf1</i>-Trap Rev:5\u2032-TGCTACAAGGAGGGGTTCTG-3\u2032. Since mutant allele at <i>Usf1</i> locus is derived from 129S2/SvPas, +/\u2212 mouse is 129/B6 heterozygous and +/\u2212 mouse is 129/129 homozygous at <i>Usf1</i> locus."

Moreover, when exposed to constant darkness over an extended time period, most homozygous <i>Clock</i> mutant mice become arrhythmic.

To this end they used a clever combination of QTL and haplotype block mapping to narrow the chromatin region carrying the <i>Soc</i> locus down to a DNA segment encompassing about 900 Kb and 22 protein encoding genes. A transcript expression analysis for seven candidate genes with a similar spatial expression pattern as <i>Clock</i> revealed that only one of these, <i>Usf1</i>, displayed significantly higher transcript accumulation in mice with the <i>Soc</i> phenotype. Moreover, a moderate overexpression of USF1 from a transgene driven by the minimal CMV promoter in B6 mice suppressed the <i>Clock</i> mutant phenotype in a similar fashion as the BALB <i>Usf1</i> allele. The cis-acting region responsible for increased <i>Usf1</i> transcription in BALB mice has been mapped to an about 1kb DNA fragment in the 5'-flanking region of <i>Usf1</i>. Importantly, in vitro (EMSA) and in vivo (ChIP-seq) binding studies demonstrated that USF1 and CLOCK-BMAL1 share significant DNA-binding specificity. The actograms of voluntary locomotor activity of <i>Usf1</i> knockout mice do not show a significantly different period length, but display lower amplitude and overall activity when compared to those of wild-type mice. This suggests that USF1 also contributes to the robustness of circadian behavior in the latter."

To illustrate the subtlety, the BALB suppression of <i>Clock</i><sup>\u039419</sup><i>/+</i> period length is \u223c0.3 hours, which is detectable at the behavioral level because the precision of the circadian clock is so good. However, this difference in period corresponds to a 0.3/24 = 1.25% difference in the cycle length. At the molecular level, we cannot detect such subtle changes and even if the molecular changes were 10-fold greater, they would be hard to discern. We also did not attempt biochemical experiments on heterozygous <i>Clock</i><sup>\u039419</sup><i>/+</i> mice because we cannot discriminate between wild-type CLOCK and CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup> in ChIP experiments and because the EMSA mobility patterns were too complex to interpret with both CLOCK:BMAL1 and CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 complexes in the same lanes."

We view these experiments as intended to explore the biochemical mechanism of CLOCK:BMAL1 and CLOCK<sup>\u039419</sup>:BMAL1 occupancy in a manner analogous to the use of in vitro biochemical assays to explore mechanism in a more simplified state, rather than to recapitulate the complex <i>Clock</i><sup>\u039419</sup><i>/+</i> heterozygous state.
