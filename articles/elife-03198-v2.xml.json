Imprinting variability could contribute to observed parent-of-origin effects on seed development. We investigated intraspecific variation in imprinting, coupled with analysis of DNA methylation and small RNAs, among three Arabidopsis strains with diverse seed phenotypes. The majority of imprinted genes were parentally biased in the same manner among all strains. However, we identified several examples of allele-specific imprinting correlated with intraspecific epigenetic variation at a TE. We successfully predicted imprinting in additional strains based on methylation variability. We conclude that there is standing variation in imprinting even in recently diverged genotypes due to intraspecific epiallelic variation. Our data demonstrate that epiallelic variation and genomic imprinting intersect to produce novel gene expression patterns in seeds."

Imprinting variability could contribute to observed parent-of-origin effects on seed development. We investigated intraspecific variation in imprinting, coupled with analysis of DNA methylation and small RNAs, among three Arabidopsis strains with diverse seed phenotypes. The majority of imprinted genes were parentally biased in the same manner among all strains. However, we identified several examples of allele-specific imprinting correlated with intraspecific epigenetic variation at a TE. We successfully predicted imprinting in additional strains based on methylation variability. We conclude that there is standing variation in imprinting even in recently diverged genotypes due to intraspecific epiallelic variation. Our data demonstrate that epiallelic variation and genomic imprinting intersect to produce novel gene expression patterns in seeds."

However, a subset of genes in flowering plants and mammals are subject to imprinting, whereby genes are expressed predominantly from one allele in a parent-of-origin dependent manner, such that traits controlled by these genes reflect the genotype of only one parent. Imprinted gene expression affects fetal growth regulation and postnatal behavior in mammals and the formation of viable seeds and the inhibition of interspecies hybridization in plants (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tycko and Morison, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jiang and K\u00f6hler, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kradolfer et al., 2013</a>). Imprinting is primarily restricted to the endosperm in plants, the triploid tissue that develops alongside the embryo and is necessary for normal embryo patterning and growth. Genome-wide surveys for imprinted expression have identified several dozen to hundreds of imprinted genes in rice, maize, Arabidopsis, mice, mules, and hinnies (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gehring et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hsieh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Luo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wolff et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">DeVeale et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Waters et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Xin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2013b</a>). Differential DNA methylation and histone modifications between maternally-inherited and paternally-inherited alleles are important regulators of imprinted gene expression (<a href=\"#bib30\">K\u00f6hler et al., 2012</a>). Endosperm DNA is maternally hypomethylated at thousands of discrete loci (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gehring et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hsieh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ibarra et al., 2012</a>) in a process dependent on the 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase DME (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gehring et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hsieh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ibarra et al., 2012</a>). Maintenance and de novo methylation pathways also appear to be compromised in the central cell and during early endosperm development (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jullien et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Belmonte et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Vu et al., 2013</a>), which might further contribute to loss of methylation from the maternally inherited genome. Endosperm DMRs (differentially methylated regions) are enriched for TE sequences, although not all imprinted gene are associated with a neighboring TE (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gehring et al., 2009</a>)."

Although very few TEs are presently active in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, most differences between genomic sequences of Arabidopsis strains are due to variation in TEs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2011</a>). Many euchromatic TEs and related sequences are targeted for RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), an active process through which 24-nt small RNAs derived from longer non-coding RNA transcripts direct DNA methyltransferases to cognate sequences (<a href=\"#bib35\">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</a>). RdDM is important for maintaining transcriptional silencing of TEs. Gene expression is negatively correlated with the proximity of TEs targeted by small RNAs and methylated TEs are under stronger purifying selection when they are near genes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2013a</a>). TE methylation is quite stable, although loss of methylation at TEs can occur spontaneously at very low frequency (<a href=\"#bib4\">Becker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schmitz et al., 2011</a>). However, a quarter of TEs in Arabidopsis are not methylated (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmed et al., 2011</a>) and only 68% are associated with small RNAs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hollister et al., 2011</a>). Thus the epigenetic modification status of TEs can be variable within the species, between different classes of elements, or even among elements of the same family."

Indeed, the first imprinted gene described, the maize <i>R</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kermicle, 1970</a>), is an example of allele-specific imprinting; only alleles that have a <i>Doppia</i> TE inserted in the promoter are imprinted (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kermicle, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Walker, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alleman and Doctor, 2000</a>). Once imprinted gene expression arises, the kinship or parental conflict theory of imprinting (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haig, 2013</a>) posits that it could be evolutionarily selected because asymmetrically related kin (e.g., half-siblings that have the same mother but different fathers) compete for maternal resources. Thus, maternally and paternally inherited alleles of genes that influence maternal resource transfer to offspring have different optima for total gene expression levels. Plants adopt a range of different strategies with regards to maternal resource transfer to offspring\u2014producing a few large seeds, or many small seeds. Intraspecific variation in this trait could potentially be linked to differences in the set of genes subject to imprinting in each strain. To systematically evaluate whether gene imprinting varies on short evolutionary time scales and to further understand the role of genetic and epigenetic polymorphisms in this process, we have investigated the conservation and variability of imprinting, DNA methylation, and small RNA production in reciprocal crosses among three strains of Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis is an ideal system in which to ask these questions because of the availability of genotyped and epigenotyped strains that have diverged for only a few thousand years."

We further evaluated intraspecific methylation variability at regions targeted for CG DNA demethylation during female reproductive development for 140 strains where vegetative methylation patterns are known (<a href=\"#bib44\">Schmitz et al., 2013</a>). Approximately 11% of imprinted genes are associated with an endosperm DMR that is variably methylated among strains. From this analysis we predicted and experimentally validated allele-specific imprinting in additional strains for two genes. The ability to predict imprinting status based on strain-to-strain variation in vegetative methylation patterns suggests that these genes are strong candidates for allelic variation in imprinting due to epigenetic differences at TEs, and thus act as epialleles. Our data demonstrate that epiallelic variation and genomic imprinting intersect to produce novel gene expression patterns in seeds. Thus, naturally occurring epialleles could have the strongest phenotypic effect during the reproductive phase of plant development, when patterns of methylation are altered."

                                "text": "We first identified genes with consistent parentally biased expression in embryo and endosperm using mRNA-seq data from six different crosses representing three sets of reciprocals: Col-Ler, Col-Cvi, and Ler-Cvi (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Imprinting could be evaluated for 16,646 loci in at least one set of reciprocal crosses and 8088 loci in all three sets of reciprocal crosses based on SNPs and sequencing depth. As previously, we implemented a series of filters to define imprinted genes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gehring et al., 2011</a>) ('Materials and methods') except that we added an additional filtering step to require endosperm maternally biased genes to have at least 85% maternal reads in each direction of the cross and paternally biased genes to have at least 50% paternal reads in each direction of the cross (the maternal and paternal cutoffs in the embryo were 70%) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In the endosperm between 122 and 145 maternally expressed imprinted genes (MEGs) were identified for each pair of reciprocal crosses (Col-Ler, Col-Cvi, or Ler-Cvi) along with between 43 and 52 paternally expressed imprinted genes (PEGs) for a total of 285 possible MEGs (including 5 TEs) and 103 PEGs in the union of all crosses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>). Many of these genes have previously been identified as imprinted genes (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 4</a>). Consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gehring et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hsieh et al., 2011</a>), very few potential imprinted genes were detected in the embryo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 3</a>). Imprinting calls based on whole-genome mRNA-seq were validated by sequencing or performing CAPs digestion on RT-PCR amplicons of 29 genes from independently isolated embryo and endosperm RNA samples (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 5</a>); results were mostly consistent with the mRNA-seq data."

Our method to identify imprinted genes explicitly relies on agreement between reciprocal crosses (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). However, genes that exhibit allele-specific imprinting will only be parentally biased when a particular strain is the male or female parent; for example a gene could be a PEG in all crosses except when Cvi is the male parent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). From the ratio of maternal/paternal mRNA-seq reads in each cross we identified those loci that were potentially biased in one direction of the cross but not the other (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Because each allele was included twice as the maternal or paternal parent in our experimental design, we were able to identify loci that consistently showed maternal or paternal bias when a particular strain was the male or female parent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

All BS-seq libraries had a high cytosine to thymine conversion rate (at least 99.70%), indicating efficient bisulfite treatment (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Methylation profiles were generated from non-redundant uniquely mapping reads (\u2018Material and methods\u2019). Endosperm DNA was consistently less methylated compared to embryo DNA in all sequence contexts (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>), as shown previously (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gehring et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hsieh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ibarra et al., 2012</a>). Embryo tissue from crosses between strains primarily displayed additive total DNA methylation (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>).

CG methylation in Cvi embryos (16.3%) was lower than in Col and Ler embryos (28.1% and 22.4%, respectively) (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). We further investigated the nature of CG hypomethylation in Cvi to determine whether it was specific to certain classes of sequences or whether CG methylation was uniformly reduced across the genome. Of the three strains, Cvi had the lowest median CG methylation levels in both genes and TEs in embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), but was largely unaffected in those sequences in either the CHG or CHH contexts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Analysis of Cvi CG methylation data from leaves (<a href=\"#bib44\">Schmitz et al., 2013</a>) confirmed that hypomethylation was not specific to embryo and endosperm but is a general property of this strain (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Loss of CG methylation was most pronounced in gene bodies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), where it was 50% lower in Cvi compared to either Ler or Col (<a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>). CG methylation in TEs was 14% lower in Cvi than in Col, but at the same level as in Ler (<a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>). Reduced gene body methylation in Cvi is unlikely to be a technical artifact of mapping biases: gene bodies have fewer SNPs and indels than TEs and thus mapping efficiency is better to genes than to TEs. All of our locus-specific bisulfite sequencing confirmed the whole-genome BS data. In Arabidopsis, gene body methylation is primarily in the CG context and is maintained after DNA replication by the maintenance methyltransferase MET1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lister et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, non-CG methylation pathways seem to operate normally in Cvi, but maintenance methylation appears to be compromised."

To identify embryo-endosperm DMRs and strain DMRs, we calculated weighted methylation levels (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schultz et al., 2012</a>) in overlapping 300 nucleotide windows across the entire genome, requiring each cytosine to have at least five reads coverage to be included in the analysis (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We then ran pairwise comparisons between all windows with sufficient coverage for embryo libraries and their matching endosperm libraries (embryo-endosperm DMRs) and for Col-0, Ler and Cvi embryo libraries against one another (strain DMRs). The distribution of differences highlighted global differences in methylation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To identify DMRs the analysis was restricted to differences in weighted methylation fraction of at least 35% for CG or CHG methylation, with a minimum overlap of three informative Cs between windows (i.e., at least 3 Cs at the exact same positions had sufficient coverage in both embryo and endosperm), and 10% for CHH methylation, with a minimum overlap of 10 informative Cs. We retained DMRs that had a FDR corrected p-value&lt;0.01, reflecting whether the fraction of methylated/unmethylated counts was the same for both samples. From 365,000 to 500,000 informative 300 bp windows, 12,000\u201314,000 Col-Cvi and Col-Ler positive CG strain DMRs were identified, corresponding to approximately 8000 features. Most strain DMRs were in genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In Col-Ler comparisons we also identified 7453 features where Ler was more methylated than Col, but only 1749 features where Cvi was more methylated than Col because of the overall reduction of CG gene body methylation in Cvi (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast to CG DMRs, strain CHH DMRs mostly mapped to TEs and intergenic regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), which are the sequences most likely to contain non-CG methylation. Similar results were obtained for Ler-Cvi comparisons (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Independent validation by methylation-sensitive PCR or locus-specific BS-PCR of six loci confirmed our genome-wide analyses (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

In contrast to strain DMRs and consistent with previous findings (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gehring et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ibarra et al., 2012</a>), most regions hypomethylated in the endosperm in both the CG and CHH contexts correspond to intergenic regions and annotated transposable element fragments. Helitron and Mu elements were most commonly represented among demethylated TEs overlapped by a DMR, reflecting their abundance in the genome (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gehring et al., 2009</a>).

Previous data suggested that small RNAs corresponding to TEs associated with MEGs accumulate in sperm cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calarco et al., 2012</a>); in these instances the silent paternal allele would already be targeted for RdDM in sperm. Paternal small RNAs, which in whole seeds must be derived from the endosperm or embryo genomes, constituted 6\u201324% of RNAs that could be assigned to a specific allele, depending on the cross (<a href=\"#SD9-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). We calculated the fraction of maternal small RNA reads for the region 1 kb 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the transcription start site of imprinted genes, retaining only those regions with at least five allele-specific reads in our analysis. MEGs were enriched for small RNAs derived from the paternally-inherited genome compared to all genes that could be evaluated for imprinting (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This suggests that silencing of the paternal allele of MEGs is associated with <i>cis</i> acting small RNAs produced from those alleles in the endosperm. Small RNA data from specific compartments of the seed will be necessary to conclusively address this question."

                                "text": "We identified regions of the genome that are subject to DNA demethylation in endosperm in at least one background but that are variably methylated among strains. Overlap between the strain DMRs and embryo-endosperm DMRs ranged from 12% for TEs to 31% for genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This suggests that there are sufficient epigenetic polymorphisms at embryo-endosperm DMRs to facilitate the formation of allele-specific imprinting. Differences in imprinting among alleles tied to differences in DNA methylation could be due to genetic or epigenetic differences (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1,2, and 3</a>). Of the 12 allele-specific imprinted genes we identified (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>), 10 were associated with coincident CG or CHH embryo-endosperm DMRs and strain DMRs, 6 of which occurred at TEs (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). For all 6 genes we confirmed by sequencing that the TE annotated in Col was present in the same genomic location in Ler and Cvi with no major sequences changes except for a few SNPs. These 6 genes were also included among imprinting validation assays (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 5</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). We more closely investigated three allele-specific imprinted genes with strong differences in the ratio of maternal to paternal transcripts in imprinted and non-imprinted crosses: AT2G32370, AT2G34890, and AT3G14205 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). AT2G32370, <i>HDG3</i>, was originally identified as a PEG because of its association with a Col and Ler embryo-endosperm DMR and because it was expressed specifically in the endosperm (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gehring et al., 2009</a>). Our new data showed that <i>HDG3</i> is not a PEG when Cvi is the male parent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The embryo-endosperm DMR associated with <i>HDG3</i> is located in a Helitron fragment (ATREP10D) 5\u2032 of the gene, and the methylated paternal allele is predominantly expressed. This region is not methylated in Cvi (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In crosses between Cvi females and Col or Ler males, maternal and paternal alleles are differentially methylated and the gene is imprinted (the naturally hypomethylated Cvi maternal allele has the same methylation profile as an actively demethylated maternal allele). But in reciprocal crosses between Col or Ler females and Cvi males, both maternal and paternal alleles are hypomethylated and the gene is biallelically expressed in the expected 2:1 maternal:paternal ratio (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This suggests that differential methylation of maternal and paternal alleles, rather than simply demethylation of the maternal allele, is required for imprinted expression. A similar logic applies to AT3G14205; the Cvi allele is hypomethylated at a 5\u2032 RC/Helitron fragment (ATREP1) compared to Col and Ler and the gene is not a PEG when it is transmitted through the Cvi male (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). AT2G34890 was a MEG except when Ler is the male parent. The Ler AT2G34890 allele is hypomethylated at a 5\u2032 MuDR element in comparison to Cvi and Col, suggesting that loss of methylation of the paternal allele could lead to its transcription (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, consistent with a more ambiguous relationship between DNA demethylation and MEGs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), closer inspection of AT2G34890 shows that at a region 5\u2032 of the TE <i>both</i> the Ler and Cvi alleles are hypomethylated compared to Col, suggesting that a clear methylation distinction between imprinted (Col and Cvi) and non-imprinted (Ler) paternal alleles does not exist (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

This allowed us to more broadly estimate the potential for allele-specific imprinting outside of Col-Ler-Cvi strains. We divided regions corresponding to embryo-endosperm DMRs into five classes based on the range of methylation variability across all 140 strains: those with very low variability in methylation (less than 0.2 mean methylation difference across all strains), low variability (between 0.2 and 0.4 mean methylation difference across all strains), a strongly bimodal class (DMRs with a range greater than 0.4 but where most of the density of the distribution in the outer 50% of the range) and two intermediate classes, weakly bimodal and not bimodal (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). DMRs with a high or intermediate methylation range and less strong clustering in the outer 50% of the distribution were considered weakly bimodal. All remaining DMRs were classified as \u2018not bimodal\u2019\u2014these regions tend to have a more uniform or unimodal distribution across a large range of scores (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>).

If the difference in imprinting among <i>HDG3</i> alleles was due to the <i>cis</i> epigenetic difference at the 5\u2032 TE, we predicted that crosses with other male parents carrying naturally hypomethylated alleles would exhibit lack of imprinting in F<sub>1</sub> endosperm. The strain Kz_9 has reduced methylation at the 5\u2032 TE, although it is more methylated than in Cvi (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). We performed reciprocal crosses between Col and Kz_9, extracted the RNA from endosperm 6 DAP and performed RT-PCR around a Col/Kz_9 SNP. Cloning and sequencing of the PCR products confirmed that <i>HDG3</i> was a PEG when Col was the male parent. In the reciprocal cross, when the hypomethylated <i>HDG3</i> allele was inherited from the Kz_9 male, <i>HDG3</i> was not imprinted (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). <i>HDG3</i> remains imprinted in crosses between Col and another strain with methylation, An_1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>). This suggests that the epigenetic state of the <i>HDG3</i> allele is sufficient to predict imprinting in other naturally occurring strains and is thus likely causal for lack of imprinting in Cvi. Similarly, the DMR variability analysis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) identified another strain, Seattle_0, where the TE 5\u2032 of AT3G14205 was hypomethylated. Similar to crosses with Cvi males, in crosses where Seattle_0 was the male parent, AT3G14205 was no longer a PEG (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), but was still a PEG when Seattle_0 was the female and Col the male. As expected for AT2G34890, where the methylation state of the 5\u2032 region was variable but did not seem to correlate with whether the allele was imprinted or not among Col, Ler, and Cvi, we found that AT2G34890 is a MEG in crosses with Col regardless of whether Es_0, a strain with a hypomethylated allele like Ler, served as the female or the male parent (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We found that most imprinted genes identified in reciprocal crosses between two strains are imprinted in crosses between other strains, or have some evidence for parental bias even if all imprinting criteria were not met. Arabidopsis allele-specific imprinted genes represent a small fraction of all possible imprinted genes, approximately 6% in our mRNA-seq datasets. These results are consistent with the extent of allele-specific imprinting in maize, where around 12% of imprinted genes fall into this category (<a href=\"#bib59\">Waters et al., 2013</a>). Allele-specific imprinting could represent genes that have recently come under the control of a TE and may or may not have an endosperm function, or genes that are imprinted specifically in one strain and not the other due to differences in control over endosperm growth and development. Under the conflict theory (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haig, 2013</a>), differences in seed size could reflect strains that have reached different optima for imprinting\u2014strains producing small seeds could be considered more maternalized and those producing larger seeds more paternalized. Arabidopsis allele-specific imprinted genes encode multiple types of proteins, including a putative transcription factor (<i>HDG3)</i>, a heat shock protein, a phosphoinositide phosphatase (AT3G14205), three chromatin proteins, and a gene required for normal levels of phytic acid accumulation in seeds (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim and Tai, 2010</a>). Further experimentation exploring the function of these genes during seed development in each genetic background will be required to determine if differences in imprinting among strains contribute to seed phenotypes."

Of the set of 388 imprinted genes we identified, 11% were associated with embryo-endosperm DMRs that are variably methylated in vegetative tissues in at least one of 140 strains (the strongly bimodal DMRs). Based on their methylation patterns, these genes have the potential to act as epialleles and exhibit allele-specific imprinting, as we demonstrated for <i>HDG3</i> and AT3G14205. However, we caution that imprinted genes associated with a strongly bimodal DMR do not always exhibit allele-specific imprinting when alleles with different methylation patterns are combined in F<sub>1</sub> endosperm. For example, we originally identified AT4G23110 as a candidate imprinted gene because it was associated with an embryo-endosperm DMR and only expressed in seeds (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gehring et al., 2009</a>), which was later confirmed by mRNA-seq (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gehring et al., 2011</a>). In this study we find that the embryo-endosperm DMR in the 5\u2032 region of the gene is strongly bimodal within the population, with 118 strains exhibiting between 60\u2013100% CG methylation in a 500 bp 5\u2032 region, and 10 strains with no methylation. However, when we performed reciprocal crosses between one of the hypomethylated strains and Col, a methylated strain, imprinting was maintained in both directions of the cross. Thus, we expect that 11% is the maximal fraction of genes that would exhibit allele-specific imprinting due to strain-to-strain differences in methylation, with the actual number being less than this."

Thus, the imprinting state of PEGs is much easier to predict based on known genetic and epigenetic characteristics. MEGs represent a more diverse class of genes, and their imprinting status is more difficult to predict based on DNA methylation or TE presence, although we do find that MEGs are enriched for small RNAs in seeds."

The susceptibility of Helitrons to loss of methylation coupled with their overabundance among embryo-endosperm DMRs further suggests that imprinting could be highly dynamic if considered on a population scale.

                        "text": "Our study also yielded several unanticipated findings. We discovered that the Cvi strain is globally hypomethylated, and primarily loses CG methylation in gene bodies. Despite its ubiquity, the function of CG gene body methylation in plants and animals is still unclear, although it may be important for regulating alternative splicing or preventing spurious transcription (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zilberman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shukla et al., 2011</a>). Mutations that reduce CG gene body methylation (e.g., mutations in the maintenance DNA methyltransferase) affect CG methylation in all genomic contexts. Because Cvi has little gene body methylation but nearly normal levels of CG methylation in other genomic features, Cvi could serve as a model genotype to further explore the function of gene body methylation in relation to gene expression or chromatin structure. Cytologically, Cvi has reduced heterochromatin and dispersed 45S rDNA repeats and DNA methylation compared to Col and Ler (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tessadori et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2009</a>). Decondensed chromatin might facilitate increased production of small RNAs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schoft et al., 2009</a>), and Cvi x Col endosperm showed little reduction in CHH methylation compared to the embryo. Consistent with this, small RNAs produced from the maternal allele represented a greater fraction of small RNAs when Cvi was the female parent in a cross (<a href=\"#SD9-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). We also observed, in contrast to a previous study (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mosher et al., 2009</a>), that small RNAs derived from the paternally inherited genome were readily detected in seed tissue from all crosses. As expected, maternal small RNAs were much more abundant than paternal small RNAs, but because we could not distinguish the three components of the seed (embryo, endosperm, and seed coat), it is unknown whether this was due to predominantly maternal expression in the endosperm, or reflective of the overall maternal bias expected in whole seeds. However, the fraction of paternal small RNAs (6\u201324%) was comparable to the fraction of paternal reads when mRNAs were sequenced from whole seeds (15\u201320%) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>), perhaps suggesting that small RNAs in seeds reflect the ratio of maternal:paternal genomes in each tissue. Our analysis of the previously published data from Col x Ler and Ler x Col siliques (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mosher et al., 2009</a>) also revealed the presence of paternally derived small RNAs, although at lower levels than in our whole seed datasets (<a href=\"#SD9-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Recent analysis of small RNAs in rice inter-strain crosses detected maternally and paternally derived small RNAs in the endosperm and suggested rice might be different from <i>A. thaliana</i> in this regard (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rodrigues et al., 2013</a>). Our data instead suggest that rice and Arabidopsis are likely similar in terms of parental small RNA composition in the endosperm, although endosperm-specific Arabidopsis profiles will be necessary to conclusively evaluate this. Interestingly, at 6 DAP the largest subunit of <i>Pol IV</i>, <i>NRPD1a</i>, was paternally biased in all crosses. <i>NRPD1a</i> has a 5\u2032 embryo-endosperm DMR associated with small RNAs, further suggesting that there may be a complex interplay and crosstalk between active DNA demethylation and the small RNA production pathway. Other genes that promote DNA methylation were also primarily paternally expressed in all crosses (e.g., the <i>VIM</i> family genes)<i>.</i> A major unsolved question is how the maternal alleles of genes that are demethylated before fertilization remain hypomethylated several days after fertilization, in the spite of the presence of small RNAs that normally target DNA methylation to these sequences. It is possible that changes to maternal endosperm chromatin structure could alter the efficacy of RNA-directed DNA methylation."

Epialleles naturally circulating in plant populations might significantly impact seed development and lead to the production of novel phenotypes in hybrids."

We considered genes with a Benjamini corrected p value less than 0.01. We further filtered the list by removing genes with an imprinting factor (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gehring et al., 2011</a>) less than 2 and by removing genes that were more than twofold higher expressed in the seed coat than embryo or endosperm at the linear cotyledon stage, using data from <a href=\"#bib5\">Belmonte et al. (2013)</a>. To obtain values from the Belmonte et al. data, for endosperm we averaged the RMA values from the MCE, PEN, and CZE samples and for seed coat we averaged values from the CZSC and SC, all from the linear cotyledon stage. Averaged values were log transformed and genes with a seed coat-endosperm or seed coat-embryo differences <span class=\"underline\">&lt;</span>1 retained. Finally, for maternally biased genes we required that at least 85% of informative reads were maternal in both directions of the reciprocal cross and for paternally biased genes that at least 50% of informative reads in both directions of the reciprocal cross were paternal. For embryo libraries the final filtering step required at least 70% of reads to be maternal in both directions of the cross for maternally biased genes and less than 30% maternal for paternally biased genes. For each set of endosperm reciprocal crosses we sequenced mRNA from three biological replicates. For a gene to be called imprinted in a particular set of endosperm crosses (Col-Ler, Ler-Cvi, or Col-Cvi), it had to be called imprinted in 2 of 3 reciprocal cross pairs of biological replicates. We chose two of three instead of three of three because of variation in sequencing depth among libraries."

For strains with both leaf and bud data, only the leaf data was used, resulting in data for 140 different Arabidopsis strains. Methylation data were extracted from the Schmitz et al. data for all of our embryo-endosperm DMRs; contiguous or overlapping DMRs were merged prior to the analysis. For each DMR we assigned a methylation score equal to the weighted mean methylation at each CpG site in the DMR (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schultz et al., 2012</a>) for each of the 140 strains. Only CpG sites with at least five reads of support and only strains with five or more CpG sites for a DMR were included in the analysis. DMRs were censored from the analysis if more than 70 of the 140 strains had missing scores. The remaining DMRs (n = 10,370) were classified into five categories that describe the distribution of methylation across the Schmitz et al. strains. DMRs with a low range of methylation scores, defined as a difference of less than 0.4 between the scores of the most and least methylated strains, were considered to have roughly consistent methylation patterns across all strains. This was further divided into a \u2018very low range\u2019 subcategory consisting of all DMRs with a range of methylation scores less than 0.2 across all strains. These DMRs have very consistent methylation scores across all strains, and tend to correspond to highly methylated transposable elements or regions near centromeres. DMRs with a score range greater than 0.4 were further subdivided according to whether the strain scores tended to be unimodal or uniformly distributed across the range of the data, or whether they tended to be bimodally distributed. This was determined by counting the number of strains whose methylation scores fell in the middle 50% of the data range, and comparing this to the number of strains whose methylation scores fell in the top or bottom 25% of the range. DMRs with a high range but with most of the density of the distribution in outer 50% of the range of the data were considered \u2018strongly bimodal\u2019 (range &gt;0.7 and fraction strains in upper or lower 25% of the range \u22650.8). These DMRs include cases where methylation is consistently high or low across strains except for one or two strong outliers. DMRs with high or intermediate range and less strong clustering in the outer 50% of the distribution were considered \u2018weakly bimodal\u2019 (range &gt;0.7 and fraction in outer 50% \u22650.5 or 0.7 \u2265range \u22650.4 and fraction in outer 50% \u22650.8).

Libraries for Illumina sequencing were constructed following the method of <a href=\"#bib14\">Grimson et al. (2008)</a>, with only minor modifications. Instead of <sup>32</sup>P-labelled oligos, 18 nt and 30 nt unlabeled marker RNAs were used in conjunction with SYBR-Gold for size selection and monitoring of ligation reactions. Marker RNAs were kept in separate lanes on the polyacrylamide-urea gels instead of being directly mixed with the RNA samples, but were processed in an identical manner. We enabled multiplexing of libraries by using four different 3\u2032 PCR primers (<a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) during library amplification, each of which was 94 bases in length as opposed to the 44 nt 3\u2032 PCR primer from the referenced protocol. As a result, the sequences obtained in the final gel purification step ranged in size from 135 to 155 nt in length."

We trimmed low-quality read ends (with fastq_quality_trimmer \u2013t 20 and \u2013l 25) and removed adapters (fastx_clipper tool \u2013a TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG \u2013i 18; <a href=\"http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/\">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/</a>). Reads were aligned using Bowtie 1.0.0 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Langmead et al., 2009</a>) using the parameters \u2013v 2 and --best, such that up to two mismatches were allowed and any read mapping to multiple locations was randomly assigned to one of the locations that had the best match to the read. We used the resequenced Ler genome (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gan et al., 2011</a>), and TAIR10 for the Col genome. We constructed a Cvi pseudogenome in which Cvi SNPs and 1 bp indels (obtained from <a href=\"http://signal.salk.edu/atg1001/download.php\">http://signal.salk.edu/atg1001/download.php</a>) were used to modify the TAIR10 genome at the appropriate positions. To facilitate unbiased mapping, sRNA reads from hybrids were aligned to a metagenome composed of the two parental genomes. The reads were then converted to TAIR10 coordinates, regardless of the parent strain of origin, and were classified using the same SNP classification approach described for the mRNA-Seq analysis. All reads that overlapped annotated tRNAs, snRNAs, rRNAs, or snoRNAs were removed. We normalized libraries by converting read values within windows into RPM (reads per million) values. The conversion from reads to RPM used the total number of reads aligning to the genome for each library following the subtraction of structural RNAs."

                                "text": "To generate a Col/Ler SNP list, we used the previously described Col/Ler SNP list (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gehring et al., 2011</a>) supplemented with novel SNPs having an unambiguous consensus base (A,C,T,G), PHRED \u2265 25, detection score = 1 from the resquenced Ler genome (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gan et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"http://mus.well.ox.ac.uk/19genomes/variants.SDI/\">http://mus.well.ox.ac.uk/19genomes/variants.SDI/</a>). In total, this yielded a list of 384,612 SNPs. To generate an initial Col/Cvi SNP list, we downloaded the SALK Cvi_0 (accession CS28198) data from <a href=\"http://signal.salk.edu/atg1001/download.php\">http://signal.salk.edu/atg1001/download.php</a>. From the quality_variant_filtered_Cvi_0.txt file, we removed SNPs with &lt;0.95 or less concordance (n = 66,272) as well as 1 bp deletions (n = 11,444). This yielded 579,310 remaining SNPs. We derived an initial Ler/Cvi SNP list using the following logic: (1) if the SNP was present in Col/Cvi list but not Col/Ler list, the Col/Cvi SNP was added to the Ler/Cvi list; (2) if the opposite scenario was true (present in Col/Ler but absent from Col/Cvi), the Col/Ler SNP was inverted (e.g., C&gt;T becomes T&gt;C) and added to the Ler/Cvi SNP list; (3) if the same SNP was found in both Col/Ler and Col/Cvi SNP lists, it was not added to the Ler/Cvi list since these SNPs arise from a difference between Col and both Ler and Cvi genomes. This yielded a list of 645,212 SNPs. In order to assess the rates of erroneous read classification using these SNP lists, we used them to classify reads of known origin from mRNA-seq and small RNA-seq libraries made from Col x Col, Ler x Ler, and Cvi x Cvi embryo and endosperm or whole seeds. SNPs that systematically misclassified reads were filtered out by using a one-tailed binomial hypothesis test with the null hypothesis that \u2018good SNPs\u2019 have an underlying acceptable error rate of \u22645% (H_0: Percent_misclassified \u2264 5%). SNPs with p&lt;0.05 were removed. This filtration method removed 5869 and 24,137 SNPs from the Col/Ler and Col/Cvi SNP lists respectively, after which we regenerated the Ler/Cvi SNP list to create the final lists of 378,743 Col/Ler SNPs, 555,801 Col/Cvi SNPs, and 619,477 Ler/Cvi SNPs (<a href=\"#SD11-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>)."

Cvi is also unique in the low CpG methylation level in gene bodies. The Cvi-specific seed phenotype might be due to Cvi-specific variation in epigenetic state of imprinted gene(s).

We have primarily focused the paper on allele-specific imprinting in order to tell a comprehensive story. However, our work has several other novel and important conclusions, some of which we list here. This is the most comprehensive analysis of imprinting in Arabidopsis, and we find that most imprinted genes are consistently parentally biased among strains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and associated supplemental figures); this is an important conclusion in its own right. We present the first data on allele-specific small RNAs from Arabidopsis seeds and find that paternal 24 nt small RNAs are present, despite a widely accepted view in the field (based on small RNA data from whole siliques) to the contrary (<a href=\"#SD9-data\">Figure 4\u2013source data 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). We find that MEGs are enriched for small RNAs derived from the paternally inherited allele, suggesting that the paternal allele might be specifically silenced by <i>cis</i> acting small RNAs (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). We also show that the Cvi strain is strikingly hypomethylated in gene bodies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and associated supplemental figures). Although the functional consequence of this, if any, is presently unknown, this observation is another important contribution to the field."

Rather, we wanted to know whether regions targeted for demethylation in the endosperm were ever variably methylated among strains, which we have shown (to identify strain-DMRs between Col, Ler, and Cvi we used the embryo data, where our coverage was much better). Despite our repeated efforts at optimization and considerable sequencing, the same starting amount of endosperm gDNA did not make a BS-seq library as diverse as embryo gDNA collected and treated at the exact same time; most endosperm BS-seq reads were discarded because they were redundant (mapped to same start position)."

The additional RNA-seq libraries were sequenced using 80 bp reads. We no longer combine read counts or include our 2011 data. To call a gene imprinted in a particular set of reciprocal crosses (Col -Ler, Col- Cvi, or Ler- Cvi) it had to meet all of our criteria for imprinting in at least two of the three replicate sets. We chose to use two of three rather than three of three because of variability in the sequencing depth of our libraries. In the revised version we have also validated the mRNA-seq data by using the miSeq platform; we isolated 2 additional endosperm biological replicates for each set of reciprocal crosses and one additional embryo and performed RT -PCR for 25 genes from these sets and sequenced the PCR amplicons. The results agreed quite well with the mRNA-seq data (see <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 1\u2013source data 5</a>)."
