Mechanistic understanding of this process is hampered by limited structural information on these macromolecular complexes. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) spatially constrain phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA). Electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions of type-II PKA-AKAP18\u03b3 complexes reveal hetero-pentameric assemblies that adopt a range of flexible tripartite configurations. Intrinsically disordered regions within each PKA regulatory subunit impart the molecular plasticity that affords an \u223c16 nanometer radius of motion to the associated catalytic subunits. Manipulating flexibility within the PKA holoenzyme augmented basal and cAMP responsive phosphorylation of AKAP-associated substrates. Cell-based analyses suggest that the catalytic subunit remains within type-II PKA-AKAP18\u03b3 complexes upon cAMP elevation. We propose that the dynamic movement of kinase sub-structures, in concert with the static AKAP-regulatory subunit interface, generates a solid-state signaling microenvironment for substrate phosphorylation."

Mechanistic understanding of this process is hampered by limited structural information on these macromolecular complexes. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) spatially constrain phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA). Electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions of type-II PKA-AKAP18\u03b3 complexes reveal hetero-pentameric assemblies that adopt a range of flexible tripartite configurations. Intrinsically disordered regions within each PKA regulatory subunit impart the molecular plasticity that affords an \u223c16 nanometer radius of motion to the associated catalytic subunits. Manipulating flexibility within the PKA holoenzyme augmented basal and cAMP responsive phosphorylation of AKAP-associated substrates. Cell-based analyses suggest that the catalytic subunit remains within type-II PKA-AKAP18\u03b3 complexes upon cAMP elevation. We propose that the dynamic movement of kinase sub-structures, in concert with the static AKAP-regulatory subunit interface, generates a solid-state signaling microenvironment for substrate phosphorylation."

Such disordered segments can act simply to link functionally coupled structural domains or they can orchestrate enzymatic reactions through a variety of allosteric mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib3\">Dyson and Wright, 2005</a>). The regulatory subunits of protein kinase A provide an example of this important phenomenon where functionally defined and structurally conserved domains are connected by intrinsically disordered regions of defined length with limited sequence identity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Scott et al., 1987</a>). In this study, we show that this seemingly paradoxical amalgam of order and disorder permits fine-tuning of local protein phosphorylation events."

A variety of stimuli trigger these events, which are catalyzed by numerous protein kinases and reversed by phosphoprotein phosphatases (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hunter, 1995</a>). A classic example is production of the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP), which stimulates a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to phosphorylate a range of cellular targets (<a href=\"#bib33\">Taylor et al., 2012</a>). The PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer composed of two regulatory subunits (R) and two autoinhibited catalytic subunits (PKAc). Binding of cAMP to each R subunit is believed to liberate active kinase and phosphorylation ensues. The local action of PKA is dictated by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that impose spatial constraint by tethering this kinase in proximity to substrates (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wong and Scott, 2004</a>). AKAPs also organize higher-order macromolecular signaling complexes through their association with G-protein coupled receptors, GTPases and additional protein kinases. Likewise, AKAP-associated phosphatases and phosphodiesterases act to locally terminate these signals. While physiological roles for AKAPs that sequester enzymatic activity with ion channels, cytoskeletal components and regulatory enzymes have been well established, the structural mechanisms involved in these protein\u2013protein interactions have been difficult to characterize."

                        "text": "Currently, structural details on PKA anchoring are limited because most AKAPs are large, intrinsically disordered macromolecules that lack recognizable structural domains. An exception is the crystal structure of the central domain of AKAP18\u03b3 that bears homology to bacterial 2H phosphoesterase domains (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gold et al., 2008</a>). Likewise, high-resolution crystallographic structures of the catalytic subunit (PKAc) when free and in complex with the C-terminal autoinhibitory and cAMP binding domains of the type I or type II regulatory subunits of PKA (RI and RII) have provided details on the mechanisms of catalysis and autoinhibition (<a href=\"#bib18\">Knighton et al., 1991</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Gold et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wu et al., 2007</a>). Yet, despite decades of effort, a complete structural picture of the PKA holoenzyme is lacking. This is presumably due to the presence of long flexible intrinsically disordered linker regions within the R subunit that tether this complex. NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallographic studies show that the N-terminal domains of RI and RII homodimerize through a four-helix bundle docking and dimerization interface (D/D) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Newlon et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Gold et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kinderman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Sarma et al., 2010</a>).

Even more elusive is a mechanistic role for intrinsically disordered domains within these macromolecular assemblies. For example, does internal flexibility within these signaling assemblies modulate other aspects of enzyme action in addition to sequestering PKA at specific regions of the cell? Here we have used electron microscopy (EM) to evaluate the topological arrangement of the fully assembled type II\u03b1 PKA holoenzyme when anchored to AKAP18\u03b3. This analysis unveils a remarkable level of conformational plasticity that resides within the AKAP\u2013PKA complex. In vitro and cell-based structure-function approaches reveal an unexpected functional requirement for intrinsically disordered regions within RII\u03b1. These regions not only define a radius of action of the anchored catalytic subunit but also modulate the enzymatic efficiency of the kinase. Insights from these studies may be broadly applicable to the understanding of other intrinsically disordered proteins and anchoring complexes that organize enzymatic action in the cell."

Single particle analysis revealed clusters of three densities, each approximately 60\u2013100 \u00c5 in size resembling beads on a string (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Closer inspection of individual particles established that these tripartite structures adopted a range of conformations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In solution, these complexes may adopt many more configurations and flattening on the carbon support of the EM grid likely captured only a subset of the possible topologies. Approximately 7,000 particles were selected from electron micrographs for structural analysis. Projection averages were derived by classifying particles of similar orientation and structural conformation using reference-free multivariate statistical analysis (<a href=\"#bib34\">van Heel et al., 1996</a>), and iterative stable alignment and clustering procedures (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yang et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

Negative staining in EM can cause flattening of particles, which might lead to apparent structural distortions. However, inspection of particles at various tilt angles showed that particles of linear and triangular conformations remained clearly distinguishable, even at high tilt angles (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In both 3D reconstructions, a central mass with dimensions of 60 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 80 \u00c5 (corresponding to the site of AKAP18\u03b3 as demonstrated by affinity gold labeling, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, black triangle and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, inset) was flanked on either side by larger densities of 100 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 85 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). These flanking densities can each accommodate a sub-complex of RII\u03b1 and PKAc. In the triangular conformation, the two peripheral densities are oriented at a 100\u00b0 angle with respect to the central density and exhibit an end-to-end length of \u223c300 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, top). The end-to-end length increases to \u223c385 \u00c5 in the extended linear configuration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, bottom). Back-projections calculated from the final 3D maps compare well with the experimental class averages (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, this back-projection analysis demonstrated that when the triangular model is tilted completely on its edge (where it may appear more linear in projection) its dimensions (max length = 300 \u00c5) are significantly smaller than the maximum end-to-end length obtained for the linear reconstruction (max length = 385 \u00c5).

A model for AKAP18\u03b3 (residues 88\u2013317) was derived by connecting the central domain (residues 88\u2013290) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gold et al., 2008</a>) via a short linker to the PKA anchoring helix (AKAP<sub>(helix)</sub>, residues 301\u2013317) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gold et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, yellow , \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

This tallies with the single particle affinity-labeling studies that map AKAP18\u03b3 to this region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, inset). In a similar manner, the peripheral densities each accommodate a PKA sub-structure consisting of one catalytic subunit (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, blue) in complex with the cAMP-binding domain of RII\u03b1, residues 91\u2013392 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, green) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Knighton et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wu et al., 2007</a>).

This structural postulate was tested by producing modified AKAP18\u03b3\u2013PKA<sub>holo</sub> complexes in which the linker region of RII\u03b1 was deleted (RII\u03b1 \u039444\u201386) or replaced with an extended sequence of 60 residues found in zebrafish (RII\u03b1 ZeChimera; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Formation of modified AKAP\u2013PKA complexes (assembled as described above) was monitored by Coomassie blue staining and immunoblot detection of the component proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The conformations of these modified AKAP18\u03b3\u2013PKA<sub>holo</sub> complexes were analyzed by electron microscopy as previously described (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013G</a>). Single-particle EM and class averages of the assemblies formed with RII\u03b1 \u039444\u201386 yielded uniform complexes exclusively in a compact triangular configuration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>). In contrast, complexes formed with RII\u03b1 ZeChimera resembled the array of conformations observed for the wild-type AKAP18\u03b3\u2013PKA<sub>holo</sub> assembly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,G</a>). Quantitative analysis of the differing linker lengths was assessed by measuring the radius of each particle, defined by the center of the AKAP18\u03b3 subunit to the distal end of each PKA subunit. Particle radii for the RII\u03b1 \u039444\u201386 complexes ranged in length from 55 to 125 \u00c5, (mean value of 87 \u00b1 13 \u00c5, n = 142; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>) whereas the assemblies formed with the RII\u03b1 ZeChimera were extended with lengths ranging from 100 to 265 \u00c5 (mean value of 168 \u00b1 33 \u00c5, n = 296; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). These latter measurements are similar to the parameters of the native complex, (160 \u00b1 29 \u00c5, n = 216; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D and 3D</a>). Thus we conclude that a flexible linker in RII\u03b1 is responsible for the conformational plasticity of the AKAP18\u03b3\u2013PKA<sub>holo</sub> assemblies."

Our structural data predict that the C subunit of anchored PKA resides within \u223c100 \u00c5 of its substrate PDE4D (shown schematically in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We reasoned that this tight configuration could permit cAMP-independent phosphorylation of the phosphodiesterase. Therefore, in the first phase, \u2018basal\u2019 phosphorylation of PDE4D was measured in the context of the AKAP18\u03b3 signaling complex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Phosphate incorporation into PDE4D was increased 1.87 \u00b1 0.14-fold (p&lt;0.05) upon its tethering to AKAP18\u03b3 as assessed by autoradiography (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D, E</a>). This suggests that the proximity to a substrate afforded by AKAP18\u03b3 augments the cAMP-independent action of PKA. This could explain why physiologically relevant PKA targets such as aquaporins or phospholamban, which require continual or instantaneous phosphorylation to fulfill their biological roles, have their own AKAP-associated pool of kinase (<a href=\"#bib13\">Henn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lygren et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gold et al., 2012</a>). Accordingly, a primary function of AKAPs may be to ensure basal phosphorylation of such tethered substrates."

We measured cAMP-independent phosphorylation of PDE4D at 5 min, a time point that showed sub-maximal substrate phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

These data show that the AKAP can be thought of as a catalyst that physically brings the reactants together, and the flexibility within the anchored PKA holoenzyme allows for the precise orientation of the enzyme and substrate. This mechanism may be particularly relevant for cAMP-independent phosphorylation events that are believed to represent approximately 30% of PKA action (<a href=\"#bib33\">Taylor et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, this hitherto unexplained but critical component of cellular PKA activity may be accomplished by the persistent phosphorylation of substrates embedded in higher-order AKAP signaling assemblies."

Additionally, there is a report that cAMP can activate PKA without C subunit release (<a href=\"#bib38\">Yang et al., 1995</a>). Therefore, we evaluated whether cAMP stimulation altered the composition of PKA holoenzymes associated with the AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> reporter. Interestingly, both the RII and C subunits of PKA were present in AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> immune complexes, even after stimulation of cAMP production by isoproterenol (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>, lanes 1 and 2). The isoproterenol-stimulated activation of PKA was validated by immunoblot detection of phosphorylated substrates with a phospho-PKA site antibody (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>, bottom panel). Control experiments confirmed that PKA subunits did not associate with the proline-modified AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> derivative, whereas the AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub>-T/A reporter retained the ability to anchor PKA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>, lanes 3\u20136)."

                        "text": "This AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> reporter data raised the question of whether anchoring can stabilize the PKA holoenzyme even in the presence of cAMP. To further test this hypothesis, co-precipitation experiments were repeated with full-length AKAP18\u03b3. Again the C subunit was retained within the AKAP complex upon isoproterenol stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>, lanes 1 and 2). This occurred regardless of whether the PKA holoenzymes were formed with wild-type RII\u03b1, RII\u03b1 \u039444\u201386, or RII\u03b1 ZeChimera (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>, top panel). These results confirm that the increased agonist-stimulated activity of the AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub>\u2013RII\u03b1 \u039444\u201386 complex shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a> is not due to enhanced dissociation of the PKA catalytic subunit. A broader implication is that release of the C subunit from anchored PKA holoenyzmes may not be required for the phosphorylation of nearby substrates. Under this scenario, association with AKAPs limits and thereby defines the range of kinase action within the cell. This underscores the central role of AKAPs in the governance of cAMP responsive phosphorylation events."

For example, the less flexible RII\u03b1 \u039444\u201386 dimer may constrain the PKAc subunits in a manner that minimizes the distance to their target substrate. Moreover, the more compact AKAP-PKA\u039444-86-substrate assembly may augment kinase activity by inhibiting the actions of signal termination enzymes. This could involve the steric exclusion of cellular protein phosphatases that catalyze the removal of phosphate or protection from phosphodiesterase activity that metabolizes cAMP. Deletion of the flexible linker between residues 44\u201386 of RII\u03b1 not only enhances basal phosphorylation of these anchored substrates, but also supplements the catalytic efficiency of the anchored PKA holoenzyme in this cellular context. However, this enhanced anchored kinase action may be an undesirable feature in vivo. Hence, we propose that the evolution of flexible linkers in RII may be a means to ensure bi-directional regulation of phosphorylation events by signal termination enzymes."

According to our structural analysis, this construct samples a range of radial conformations that are very similar to wild-type particles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Moreover, this observation is consistent with theoretical analyses of random coiled chain models that demonstrate the average end-to-end length of random coil scales by the square root of the number of amino acids in the chain (average length \u223c <i>N</i><sup>0.5</sup>, where <i>N</i> is the number of residues) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Flory, 1975</a>). This statement implies that the average length separating the ends of a random coil reaches a plateau, or maximum, that is only marginally altered upon the inclusion of more residues. Consequently extending the linker in the context of the RII\u03b1 ZeChimera may explain why this affords minimal benefit to the overall structure and dynamics of this seemingly more extended and malleable anchored enzyme complex. Hence, evolutionary constraint of the RII\u03b1 linker domain to 45\u201347 residues may ensure appropriate separation between the anchoring and transduction domains of anchored mammalian PKA holoenzymes."

Not only does this structural plasticity explain why an intact PKA holoenzyme structure has eluded X-ray crystallographers for over 20 years but also suggests that the \u2018built in\u2019 flexibility within this protein complex sets a dynamic range for basal and cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of nearby substrates. This latter concept could have profound implications for PKA and other kinases, where enzyme activity is constrained within anchored complexes or enzyme scaffolds. The conformational variability of the tethered complex could enhance kinase access to multiple phosphorylation sites on the same substrate, or, alternatively, orient each catalytic subunit toward distinct substrate proteins within the vicinity of the scaffolding site. Our structural and cellular characterization of higher-order AKAP assemblies emphasizes how static protein\u2013protein interactions act in concert with the dynamic movement of sub-structures to orchestrate local phosphorylation events. We believe that these combined molecular approaches are broadly applicable for the investigation of related enzyme complexes that are spatially organized within the cell."

Fluorescence emission was acquired using a DMI6000B inverted microscope (Leica), an EL6000 component (fluorescent light source, filter wheel, ultra fast shutter, Leica) and a CoolSnap HQ camera (Photometrics), all controlled by MetaMorph 7.6.4 (Molecular Devices). Dual-emission images were obtained simultaneously through a Dual-View image splitter (Photometrics) with S470/30 and S535/30 emission filters and 505 dcxr dichroic mirror (Chroma). Exposure time was 200 ms with an image interval of 10 s. FRET changes within a region of interest were calculated as the ratio of measured fluorescent intensities from two channels (M<sub>donor</sub>, M<sub>indirectAcceptor</sub>) after subtraction of background signal. FRET ratio (YFP/CFP) changes were normalized to the average FRET ratio value before stimulation."

The atomic coordinates of the AKAP\u2013PKA binding helix in complex with the RII\u03b1 docking and dimerization domain (RII<sub>D/D</sub>-AKAP<sub>helix</sub>; PDB 2IZX) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gold et al., 2006</a>) was used as a template to model the corresponding region in AKAP18\u03b3, residues 301\u2013317, by computational mutation and minimization in COOT (<a href=\"#bib4\">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</a>).

There has been rather little structural information on AKAP complexes. New structural data has the potential to provide significant new insights into the mechanisms of this and related systems. Here, the authors have purified a complex corresponding to a single AKAP18\u03b3 molecule together with two copies of the PKA RII\u03b1 subunit and two PKAc subunits. The complex was subjected to negative stain electron microscopy and single particle analysis. The authors identify a tripartite architecture for the complex with the AKAP protein located centrally in close association with two dimerization interface domains of the RII subunits. Conversely, the two PKAc subunits closely associated with the cAMP binding domains of the RII subunits are mapped to the peripheral densities. The authors provide biochemical data to support the conclusion that the architecture of the AKAP complex contributes to PKA-mediated phosphorylation dynamics."

The concept of a highly flexible complex is initially introduced in interpreting the appearance of raw images and class averages of the complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). However, variations in appearance of such projection images can in principle arise from either conformational variability or from projections of the three-dimensional structure in different directions. The 2D analysis of the projection images does to not appear to be optimal. The class averages in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> appear to be over-averaged with quite low levels of detail \u2013 in comparison there appear to be significant details in the original images that are not recovered in the class averages. A more powerful classification procedure such as the ISAC program developed in the Penzcek lab may result in higher-quality class averages and aid the analysis."

This provides stronger evidence for the existence of multiple conformations. However, there is a significant concern here with respect to the analysis of tilted negatively stained images. Although the negative stain approach yields relatively faithful images at zero tilt, it is typically associated with substantial shrinkage normal to the surface of the grid. Hence tilted images are commonly distorted from their proper projection structures. This could lead, for example, to the apparent linearization of a triangular conformation. Careful analysis of untilted images exploiting the most effective classification approaches should make it possible to recover a sufficient range of projections from untilted images for 3D analysis."
