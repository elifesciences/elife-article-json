Here, we explored neural coding in the barrel cortex of head-fixed mice that tracked walls with their whiskers in tactile virtual reality. Optogenetic manipulations revealed that barrel cortex plays a role in wall-tracking. Closed-loop optogenetic control of layer 4 neurons can substitute for whisker-object contact to guide behavior resembling wall tracking. We measured neural activity using two-photon calcium imaging and extracellular recordings. Neurons were tuned to the distance between the animal snout and the contralateral wall, with monotonic, unimodal, and multimodal tuning curves. This rich representation of object location in the barrel cortex could not be predicted based on simple stimulus-response relationships involving individual whiskers and likely emerges within cortical circuits."

Here, we explored neural coding in the barrel cortex of head-fixed mice that tracked walls with their whiskers in tactile virtual reality. Optogenetic manipulations revealed that barrel cortex plays a role in wall-tracking. Closed-loop optogenetic control of layer 4 neurons can substitute for whisker-object contact to guide behavior resembling wall tracking. We measured neural activity using two-photon calcium imaging and extracellular recordings. Neurons were tuned to the distance between the animal snout and the contralateral wall, with monotonic, unimodal, and multimodal tuning curves. This rich representation of object location in the barrel cortex could not be predicted based on simple stimulus-response relationships involving individual whiskers and likely emerges within cortical circuits."

We tested whether whisker-guided wall tracking uses neural activity in the barrel cortex. Excitatory neurons in the barrel cortex were silenced by photostimulating GABAergic neurons expressing ChannelRhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in VGAT-ChR2-EYFP transgenic mice (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>). Laser light was focused on the skull, 'photoinhibiting' all cortical layers across a 2-mm-diameter area within 20 ms of laser onset, which was reversed within 150 ms after laser offset (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guo et al., 2014</a>). Rapid laser movement between spots on the left and right hemispheres enabled bilateral photoinhibition of the cortex. For silencing barrel cortex, the laser was centered on the C2 barrel, localized using intrinsic signal imaging (<a href=\"#bib42\">O'Connor et al., 2010</a>). Mice whiskers were trimmed such that either a single C2 whisker (n = 3) or the C1, C2, and C3 whiskers (n = 5) remained. The corresponding barrel columns fall within the central millimeter of the photoinhibition volume, thus ensuring that the relevant representation in the barrel cortex was abolished by photoinhibition. The task was performed in the dark and stray light from the laser was shielded, eliminating visual cues for locomotion. Photoinhibition lasted for the time needed for mice to run through a one-meter bend (typically 3\u20137 s)."

Photoactivation was controlled in a closed-loop with the motion of the ball and in the absence of walls thus creating an 'illusory corridor', where information about distance to illusory walls is encoded in the strength of the photostimulus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Stimuli consisted of 2-ms laser pulses (10 Hz); at maximum experienced power the photostimulus evoked up to 8 additional spikes per neuron per second in layer 4 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). The power was modulated depending on the position of the mice in the illusory corridor. When mice were in the center of the illusory corridor the laser was off; when mice were on the right side, the left barrel cortex was activated, and vice-versa. The closer the mice were to the edge of the illusory corridor, the higher the laser power in the corresponding hemisphere. Mice responded to photoactivation of layer 4 by making left and right turns at bends in the illusory corridor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), with slightly lower angle error than when responding to real walls (angle error 2.30 \u00b1 0.85\u00b0 vs. 3.19 \u00b1 0.55\u00b0, p = 0.026 t-test). Running speeds in the illusory corridor were slower (13.2 \u00b1 3.6 cm/s) than running speeds in the corridor with walls (20.4 \u00b1 3.8 cm/s). When parietal (n=3 mice) or visual cortices (n=5 mice) were activated mice did not follow the bends in the corridor (angle error 14.01 \u00b1 1.73\u00b0 vs. 3.19 \u00b1 0.55\u00b0, p = 1.7*10<sup>-8</sup> t-test) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). This response to photoactivation was not learnt as all mice performed the task from the very first trial, similarly to how they perform the task with the real walls (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sofroniew et al., 2014</a>), and the reward was provided in each trial independent of behavioral performance."

In closed-loop, wall distance sampling is non-uniform because the sensory stimulus depends on behavior. We combined epochs across several widths and bends in the corridor to approximately sample wall distance as in the open-loop condition. Units showed similar tuning curves under both open-loop and closed-loop (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3a,b</a>), with similar average rates over the same wall distances range (107/114; 94% -0.5 &lt; open vs. closed modulation &lt; 0.5) (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3c,d</a>).

For a subset of mice (3 mice; 29 regular spiking units) we recorded activity in response to open-loop movements of the ipsilateral wall.

Mice used their whiskers to navigate winding corridors in tactile virtual reality (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sofroniew et al., 2014</a>). Neural activity in the barrel cortex was necessary for guiding locomotion based on whisker cues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In addition, graded activation of layer 4 neurons in the barrel cortex was sufficient to guide locomotion in an illusory corridor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Remarkably, similar to closed-loop wall tracking (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sofroniew et al., 2014</a>), no training was required for mice to run in an illusory corridor. The tracking accuracy in the illusory corridor was on par or better compared to the real corridor; this may be because the photostimulus provided a stronger distance-dependent signal compared to touch-evoked activity. These experiments show that downstream layers and brain areas can interpret increases of layer 4 spike rate as increased proximity to a wall on the contralateral side and drive the appropriate turning responses. Previous experiments suggest key roles for the superior colliculus in orienting and goal-directed behaviors (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sprague, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cohen and Castro-Alamancos, 2007</a>). Barrel cortex activity could drive whisker-guided locomotion through the superior colliculus and rubrospinal circuits. These brain areas could also be capable of mediating this behavior independently after chronic barrel cortex lesions."

Sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion have monotonic responses to object distance (<a href=\"#bib64\">Szwed et al., 2006</a>). Similarly, during passive stimulation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Simons, 1978</a>) or simple single-whisker behaviors (<a href=\"#bib55\">Simons, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Peron et al., 2015</a>) barrel cortex neurons show monotonic relationships with stimulus strength. The majority of L2/3 and L4 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2b,c</a>) neurons responded weakly when the wall was out of reach and only responded strongly when the contralateral wall came within reach. However, many neurons exhibited a rich representation of wall distance (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a>). Some neurons had non-monotonic unimodal relationships with wall distance and were most active at intermediate wall distances. Across the population, neuronal tuning tiled all wall distances (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g</a>). Activity of other neurons showed even more complex, multimodal tuning to wall distance. Complex responses to wall distance were especially pronounced in L5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4i</a>). Encoding wall distance with a population of tuning curves that increase monotonically with decreasing wall distance (i.e. sigmoids) would lead to very large metabolic costs when representing small distances. Given a fixed metabolic cost, a population of non-monotonic (i.e. Gaussian) tuning curves that tile the most frequently encountered distances can achieve higher overall encoding accuracy (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ganguli and Simoncelli, 2014</a>). Some of the features of these complex tuning curves may also be used for processing by downstream neurons."

The calcium imaging dataset in addition contained some neurons that were activated by running and suppressed monotonically as the wall came closer to the face (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). These neurons may have been activated by tactile stimuli from the D and E row whiskers that are capable of touching the ball during running, and suppressed as the shorter surround whiskers touched the wall at smaller wall distances. In contrast, in the electrophysiology data the majority of the units were located in the C row barrels and had low baseline activity even during running."

Mice may have adjusted their whisker movements in subtle ways with wall distance (<a href=\"#bib67\">Voigts et al., 2015</a>) which could change the strengths of the interactions with the wall and thus shape tuning curves. The similarity of tuning curves under open-loop and closed-loop conditions (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), where running direction are different, suggests that the details of whisker motion are unlikely to be a critical factor. Another mechanism is based on cross-columnar inhibition mediated by multi-whisker interactions (<a href=\"#bib56\">Simons, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brumberg et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Moore and Nelson, 1998</a>). Individual whiskers have different lengths (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ibrahim and Wright, 1975</a>) and touch the wall at different times as it approaches. Neurons driven by the long whiskers may be suppressed by neurons driven by the shorter whiskers at smaller wall distances, resulting in non-monotonic distance tuning curves. A third mechanism relies on cross-laminar excitation and inhibition. Neurons in different layers are coupled through interlaminar connections which excite both excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons in the target layers (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lefort et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hooks et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Feldmeyer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pluta et al., 2015</a>). The balance of excitation and inhibition can change over time scales of milliseconds to seconds. For example, over short time scales the synchronous excitation of L4 neurons (<a href=\"#bib44\">O'Connor et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hires et al., 2015</a>) is expected to drive spikes in L5 neurons (<a href=\"#bib44\">O'Connor et al., 2013</a>). Over longer time scales L4 activation promotes mostly inhibition in L5 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pluta et al., 2015</a>). Cross-columnar and cross-laminar inhibition combined with short-term synaptic plasticity, likely help generate the complex representation of distance in the barrel cortex, which in turn supports wall-tracking behavior."

This is an important extension of prior whisker coding studies in mouse S1, which have focused on simple detection, front-back localization, and surface properties. Using optogenetics, the authors show that S1 firing is necessary and sufficient for accurate wall following. Multi electrode recording, and calcium imaging, show that many S1 neurons encode wall distance, with most neurons preferring close distances, but many showing clear tuning for intermediate wall distances. In addition, many S1 neurons also encode direction of wall motion. Overall, these findings reveal a critical role for S1 activity in encoding distance estimation during wall following behavior."
