Differential roles of these isoforms as autoreceptors are poorly understood. By virally expressing the isoforms in dopamine neurons of D2 receptor knockout mice, this study assessed the calcium-dependence and drug-induced plasticity of D2S and D2L receptor-dependent G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) currents. The results reveal that D2S, but not D2L receptors, exhibited calcium-dependent desensitization similar to that exhibited by endogenous autoreceptors. Two pathways of calcium signaling that regulated D2 autoreceptor-dependent GIRK signaling were identified, which distinctly affected desensitization and the magnitude of D2S and D2L receptor-dependent GIRK currents. Previous in vivo cocaine exposure removed calcium-dependent D2 autoreceptor desensitization in wild type, but not D2S-only mice. Thus, expression of D2S as the exclusive autoreceptor was insufficient for cocaine-induced plasticity, implying a functional role for the co-expression of D2S and D2L autoreceptors."

Differential roles of these isoforms as autoreceptors are poorly understood. By virally expressing the isoforms in dopamine neurons of D2 receptor knockout mice, this study assessed the calcium-dependence and drug-induced plasticity of D2S and D2L receptor-dependent G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) currents. The results reveal that D2S, but not D2L receptors, exhibited calcium-dependent desensitization similar to that exhibited by endogenous autoreceptors. Two pathways of calcium signaling that regulated D2 autoreceptor-dependent GIRK signaling were identified, which distinctly affected desensitization and the magnitude of D2S and D2L receptor-dependent GIRK currents. Previous in vivo cocaine exposure removed calcium-dependent D2 autoreceptor desensitization in wild type, but not D2S-only mice. Thus, expression of D2S as the exclusive autoreceptor was insufficient for cocaine-induced plasticity, implying a functional role for the co-expression of D2S and D2L autoreceptors."

Furthermore, exposure to cocaine and other drugs is known to change how these calcium ions regulate D2 receptor signaling. Now, Gantz et al. have used mice that produce only a single variant of the D2 receptor (either D2S or D2L) in their dopamine neurons to uncover similarities and differences between the two variants. The experiments show that localized increases in calcium ion concentration make D2S less capable of autoinhibition, like D2 receptors in neurons from wild type mice, without affecting autoinhibition by D2L."

In dopamine neurons from wild type mice, a single exposure to cocaine eliminates the calcium-dependent regulation; thus, cocaine treatment causes a D2L-like response. In contrast, cocaine treatment did not affect the calcium-dependent regulation when only one variant of the D2 receptor was present. This implies that dopamine neurons must have both D2S and D2L receptors before the drug can induce changes in D2 receptor signaling. These findings also challenge the long-held view that the D2S receptor is the predominant form involved in autoinhibition. The next challenge is to determine how cocaine induces an apparent switch from D2S to D2L and the implications of this switch for the development of cocaine addiction."

Natural rewards, reward-predictive cues, and drugs of abuse elicit a rapid increase in dopamine release from dopamine axon terminals and somatodendritic sites within the ventral midbrain. Dopamine release is negatively regulated by the activation of dopamine D2 autoreceptors on somatodendritic and axon terminals (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib15\">Ford, 2014</a>). Loss of D2 autoreceptor-mediated inhibition results in elevated extracellular dopamine and is associated with perseverative drug-seeking, enhanced motivation for food, and novelty-induced hyperactivity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Marinelli and White, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Marinelli et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bello et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Anzalone et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Holroyd et al., 2015</a>). Chronic D2 autoreceptor activation impairs the formation of dopamine- and glutamate-releasing axon terminals (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fasano et al., 2010</a>). Thus, D2 autoreceptors regulate structural and functional plasticity of dopamine neurons and are essential in limiting impulsivity and reward-seeking behaviors."

A component of desensitization is dependent on intracellular calcium (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beckstead and Williams, 2007</a>).

Biased expression of D2S or D2L receptors alters behavioral responses to drugs of abuse (<a href=\"#bib53\">Smith et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bulwa et al., 2011</a>) and has been associated with drug addiction in human studies (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sasabe et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Moyer et al., 2011</a>). Functionally distinct roles for D2S and D2L receptors have been proposed based on characterization of mice lacking D2L (<a href=\"#bib56\">Usiello et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2000</a>) or D2S (<a href=\"#bib49\">Radl et al., 2013</a>). Behavioral and biochemical studies have designated D2L as the postsynaptic receptor expressed on non-dopaminergic medium spiny neurons in the basal forebrain and D2S as the autoreceptor (<a href=\"#bib32\">Khan et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Usiello et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lindgren et al., 2003</a>). However, both D2S and D2L receptors are expressed in dopamine neurons and function as somatodendritic autoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Khan et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jomphe et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Neve et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dragicevic et al., 2014</a>).

Using virus-mediated expression of the D2 receptor splice variants in D2 receptor knockout mice, this study reveals that D2S but not D2L receptor-dependent GIRK signaling exhibited calcium-dependent desensitization. Manipulations of pathways involved in D2 autoreceptor desensitization had distinct actions on D2S and D2L receptor-dependent GIRK currents. Lastly, a single in vivo cocaine exposure removed the calcium-dependent component of D2 autoreceptor-GIRK desensitization in wild type mice, but not D2S-only mice; thus, the expression of D2S as the exclusive autoreceptor was insufficient for drug-induced plasticity. Taken together, the results of this study imply a physiological role for the co-expression of D2S and D2L autoreceptors."

As shown previously in wild type dopamine neurons, CPA reduced the decline in the quinpirole-induced current using EGTA internal and had no effect when using BAPTA internal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). CPA did not change the decline in the baclofen-induced current recorded with either internal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In D2S neurons, CPA also reduced the decline in the quinpirole-induced current, but the decline in the quinpirole-induced current in D2L neurons was not changed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These results indicate that calcium release from intracellular stores contributed to D2S but not D2L receptor-GIRK desensitization."

To test whether D2L receptors are involved, <i>Drd2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice that had received midbrain injections of AAV-D2S or AAV-D2L were given a single injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and brain slices were made 24 hr later. In D2L neurons, cocaine exposure did not alter the decline in quinpirole-induced current (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Likewise, cocaine exposure did not alter the calcium-dependent decline in the quinpirole-induced current in D2S neurons. Similar to na\u00efve AAV-D2S mice, the decline of the quinpirole-induced current was greater using EGTA internal than with BAPTA internal (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Thus, unlike what was found in slices from wild type mice, cocaine exposure did not reduce the calcium-dependent decline in the quinpirole-induced current. This result was not dependent on overexpression as it was also observed in D2S neurons in which quinpirole produced outward currents of similar magnitude to wild type neurons (data not shown). This result was also recapitulated in the transgenic D2S mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), where expression of D2S receptors in the midbrain is restricted to dopamine neurons. Since wild type, but not D2S-only dopamine neurons exhibited a reduction in calcium-dependent desensitization after cocaine exposure, these results suggest that constitutive or viral-mediated expression of D2S as the exclusive autoreceptor was insufficient for cocaine-induced plasticity."

In dopamine neurons from mice infected with both splice variants, the amplitude of the quinpirole-induced currents was similar to those measured in neurons expressing D2S- or D2L-only (EGTA: 333 \u00b1 48 pA, <i>n</i> = 9; BAPTA: 442 \u00b1 86 pA, <i>n</i> = 6, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B, 4C</a> for comparison). This suggests a similar level of D2 receptor overexpression as in neurons that express single variants. Surprisingly, the decline in the quinpirole-induced current was similar between EGTA and BAPTA internals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Therefore, the viral expression of both D2S and D2L receptors did not mimic D2 receptor-dependent GIRK signaling in na\u00efve wild type mice. Moreover, the decline in the quinpirole-induced current did not change after in vivo cocaine exposure (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), suggesting that the viral expression of both D2S and D2L receptors precluded cocaine-induced plasticity in D2 receptor-dependent GIRK signaling. To ensure that this result was not due to preferential expression of D2L receptors following injection of the D2S/D2L virus mixture, dopamine neurons in transgenic D2S mice were infected with AAV-D2L. The expression of D2S was confirmed by labeling dopamine neurons with an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated M1 antibody and imaging on a two-photon microscope (e.g., <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Recordings were made from neurons with Flag-D2S staining that were also GFP<sup>+</sup> (AAV-D2L). With EGTA internal, the decline in the quinpirole-induced current in transgenic D2S neurons also expressing D2L was equivalent to the decline measured in neurons receiving the D2S/D2L virus mixture, and significantly less than the decline in the quinpirole-induced current in transgenic D2S-only neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). As observed in wild type, there was no change in the decline in the baclofen-induced current after cocaine exposure in any of the groups (p &gt; 0.05 for all comparisons, data not shown).

This study assessed the calcium-dependence and drug-induced plasticity of the desensitization of GIRK currents mediated by D2S and D2L receptors expressed in SNc dopamine neurons. The results reveal that the D2S receptor, but not the D2L receptor, exhibited calcium-dependent desensitization. Manipulating pathways for calcium signaling removed the calcium-dependent component of D2S receptor desensitization, demonstrating these receptors were amenable to plasticity. Cocaine exposure eliminated calcium-dependent D2 autoreceptor desensitization in dopamine neurons from wild type mice without altering desensitization of neurons expressing only D2S or D2L.

The lack of a calcium-dependent component in D2L receptor desensitization could be due to localization outside of the calcium microdomains, despite showing similar distribution in the somatodendritic compartment as D2S receptors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jomphe et al., 2006</a>), or to another property of this isoform. Depleting intracellular calcium stores or blocking L-type calcium channels produced robust augmentation in D2L receptor-dependent GIRK currents produced by iontophoretically applied dopamine that was greater than the augmentation of D2S receptor-dependent GIRK currents. The lack of effect of manipulating calcium signaling on D2L receptor desensitization in the presence of a saturating concentration of quinpirole suggests that the enhanced response of D2L to iontophoretically applied dopamine does not reflect removal of tonic desensitization. Nonetheless, the same intracellular pathways interacting with D2S receptors also modified D2L receptor-dependent GIRK currents. It is therefore likely that D2S and D2L receptors are in similar calcium microdomains and the lack of apparent calcium-dependent desensitization upon saturating agonist exposure is a property specific to the D2L isoform."

In this study, the viral expression of D2L receptors, alone or with D2S receptors, resulted in a loss of calcium-dependent D2 receptor desensitization. Moreover, it precluded any further cocaine-induced reduction in calcium-dependent D2 receptor desensitization. These results suggest that the overexpression of D2L receptors resembles cocaine-induced plasticity.

In addition, cocaine-induced plasticity occurred in wild type, but not D2S-only neurons, indicating a loss of some process in neurons which express D2S as the exclusive autoreceptor that is permissive to cocaine-induced plasticity. However, the viral-mediated co-expression of D2S with D2L receptors also did not resemble wild type, and instead was similar to D2L-only. Although it is not known to what extent developmental compensation, virus-mediated expression, and variegated D2 receptor expression in <i>Drd2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice affected D2 receptor translation or trafficking (i.e. affecting the ratio of functional D2S and D2L receptors), or other regulatory elements of D2 receptor signaling, this result suggests that in wild type dopamine neurons, the functional expression of D2L may be limited. Changes in calcium signaling or exposure to cocaine may bring about an increased contribution of D2L, although this has yet to be directly demonstrated. Taken together, this study suggests that D2S may serve as the predominant autoreceptor under basal conditions, but the functional contribution of D2L autoreceptors may be revealed after drug exposure."

Since not all dopamine neurons express both D2S and D2L receptors, this study suggests that D2 autoreceptors in a subset of dopamine neurons are regulated differently by calcium and resistant to cocaine-induced plasticity. Given the heterogeneity of dopamine neurons and their projections (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib50\">Roeper, 2013</a>), a greater understanding of this subset may reveal insights into plasticity in their projection areas."

Whenever possible, experiments were conducted blinded to treatment or splice variant expression. Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by decapitation. Brains were removed quickly and placed in ice-cold physiologically equivalent saline solution (modified Krebs buffer) containing (in mM) 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.4 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 11 D-glucose with MK-801 (10 \u03bcM), and cut horizontally (220 \u03bcm) using a vibrating microtome (Leica). Slices recovered at 30\u00b0C in vials with 95/5% O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> saline with MK-801 (10 \u03bcM) for at least 30 min prior to recording. Slices were then mounted in a recording chamber and perfused at a rate of \u223c3.0 ml/min with 33\u201335.5\u00b0C modified Krebs buffer. Recordings were made exclusively from neurons in the SNc identified visually by their location lateral to the medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic. The neurochemical identity of AAV-D2-infected cells was not verified post-recording. Rather, dopamine neurons were identified by location and electrophysiological properties, namely the presence of spontaneous pacemaker firing of broad (\u223c2 ms) action potentials at 1\u20135 Hz in cell-attached mode (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ford et al., 2006</a>), characteristic passive membrane properties including capacitance and resting conductance (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gantz et al., 2011</a>), and a prominent slow hyperpolarization-activated inward (I<sub>h</sub>) current (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ford et al., 2006</a>). These parameters readily distinguished dopamine neurons from GABAergic neurons. The expression of D2 receptors was not used as a physiological criterion for dopamine neuron identity. However, all dopamine neurons from wild type mice identified by location and electrophysiological properties had a D2 receptor-dependent outward current upon quinpirole application. Recordings were obtained with large glass electrodes with a resistance of 1.3\u20131.9 M\u2126 when filled with internal solution containing either, (in mM) 115 K-methanesulfonate, 20 NaCl, 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES (K), 2 ATP, 0.2 GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, and 10 BAPTA (K4) or 130 K-methanesulfonate, 20 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES (K), 2 ATP, 0.2 GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, and 0.1 EGTA; pH 7.33\u20137.40, 275\u2013288 mOsm. The concentration of CaCl<sub>2</sub> required to increase resting free calcium in BAPTA internal was determined with use of the EGTAetc program, provided by EW McCleskey. Within 2 min of break-in, membrane capacitance, series resistance, and input resistance were measured with the application of 3 pulses (\u00b12 mV for 50 ms) averaged before computation using the Axograph (sampled at 50 kHz, filtered at 10 kHz). Series resistance was monitored to ensure sufficient and stable electrical access to the inside of the cell throughout the experiment (&lt;12 M\u2126). Cells were dialyzed with internal solution for &gt;10 min prior to drug application (<a href=\"#bib14\">Foehring et al., 2009</a>). All drugs were applied through bath perfusion, except dopamine, which was applied by iontophoresis. Quinpirole and baclofen were applied with &gt;10 min between the agonist applications with the application order alternated between recordings. The amplitude and the decline in the currents were not affected by the order in which the drugs applied. Slices were exposed to saturating concentrations of each agonist once. Recordings where the peak amplitude of the current was &lt;50 pA were excluded from decline analysis. Dopamine hydrochloride (1 M) was ejected as a cation with a single pulse (2\u201310 ms, &gt;20 nA) from a thin-walled iontophoretic electrode placed within 10 \u03bcm of the soma once every 50 s. Access resistance was assessed during these recordings with a brief (200 ms) step to \u221270 mV once every 50 s. Data were acquired using AxoGraph software (AxographX, Berkeley, CA) and Chart 7 (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO) and were post hoc filtered. The amplitude of currents induced by iontophoretic application of dopamine was determined by averaging the current \u00b120 ms from the greatest upward deflection. For each cell, 6\u201324 consecutive currents were averaged to determine \u2018baseline\u2019 (preceding drug application) and post-drug amplitudes. sIPSCs were detected and analyzed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gantz et al., 2013</a>). Briefly, single peak sIPSCs with amplitudes greater than 2.1 times the SD of baseline noise were detected using a semiautomated sliding template detection procedure with AxoGraph X. Each detected event was visually inspected and discarded if the baseline noise was greater than the sIPSC peak \u00b11 s from the peak. Duration of sIPSCs was determined by measuring the width at 20% of the peak."

For example, one reviewer points out: \u201cThe Abstract states: \u2018expression of D2S as the exclusive autoreceptor was insufficient for cocaine-induced plasticity, demonstrating a functional role for the co-expression of D2S and D2L auto receptors.\u2019 However, the Results state: \u2018regardless of the presence of D2S, the expression of D2L eliminated calcium-dependent D2 receptor desensitization and precluded cocaine-induced plasticity\u2019. If some DA neurons express either D2S or D2L, they do not show cocaine-induced autoreceptor plasticity, and if D2L blocks plasticity, then it is not clear under what conditions cocaine would induce autoreceptor plasticity (in WT mice).\u201d Another reviewer suggested: \u201cThe authors should discuss why this might be the case. For example is it possible that cocaine treatment upregulates D2L in wild type neurons, thus eliminating calcium-dependent desensitization? Could this be tested?

Dopamine neurons from these mice also did not show cocaine-induced changes (presented in the revised <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). It is possible that the over-expression of D2S receptors interfered with the observation of cocaine-induced plasticity. To examine this possibility, we took advantage of the variable viral expression and only analyzed cells in which quinpirole produced wild type-sized outward currents (\u223c200 pA with EGTA internal and \u223c400 pA with BAPTA internal). The exclusion of large amplitude currents, presumably those over-expressing D2S, did not change the results.

In experiments with iontophoretic application of dopamine, the neurons were voltage-clamped at -60 mV prior to application of isradipine. Once every 50s, prior to the iontophoretic application of dopamine, we made a brief voltage step from -60 to -70 back to -60 mV. A similar step is sufficient to induce calcium entry via L-type calcium channels in dopamine neuron dendrites (<span class=\"underline\">Hage and Khaliq, 2014</span>). The revised manuscript includes this methodological detail. However, it is unclear whether this step was necessary to observe the effect of isradipine. While there was no dramatic clamp escape, it is possible that there was a slight deviation in membrane potential. Cav1.3 channels are steeply voltage-dependent between -60 and -50 mV.

Between-group comparisons of the effect of CPA and isradipine on the magnitude of maximal current produced by quinpirole in wild type neurons are now included in the revised manuscript. These results suggest that there is no significant effect of CPA or isradipine on the magnitude of maximal currents produced by bath application of quinpirole. Similar between-group comparisons in D2S and D2L neurons were not made due to variability in amplitude produced by the degree of virus infection. The goals of the iontophoretically applied dopamine experiments were to: a) avoid pre-desensitizing D2 receptors with saturating agonist, b) avoid a ceiling effect that may occur with saturating D2 receptor activation of GIRK channels, c) measure a stable current amplitude before application of drug to allow for within-cell comparisons, and d) enable high temporal resolution of changes occurring over the course of &gt;30 mins. These goals were best met with focal and transient activation of receptors using the iontophoresis of dopamine."

Thus it is unlikely the difference in our results from wild type neurons is due to differences between saturating and subsaturating application. It may be that dopamine (vs. quinpirole) or repeated agonist application is necessary to observe the augmentation. The mechanism by which the augmentation occurs remains to be determined. These results provide the framework for future studies by demonstrating that D2L-GIRK currents are more readily augmented."

Desensitization of D2S was readily reduced by changes in calcium signaling (intracellular stores and L-type calcium channels), but not in vivo cocaine. This was also observed in the transgenic mouse where D2S receptors were selectively expressed using the TH promoter. Thus, the conclusion is made that it is unlikely that cocaine exposure is altering D2 receptor desensitization in wild type dopamine neurons by changing calcium entry via intracellular stores or L-type calcium channels, otherwise it would have been observed in D2S-only neurons. Then the possibility that D2L autoreceptors may have some role in cocaine-induced plasticity in wild type dopamine is suggested, but it is made clear that this has not been directly demonstrated. Additional caveats of non-cell autonomous effects are also discussed."

Steps were taken in targeting the viral injection site to the rostral-lateral portion of the SNc to avoid infection of GABAergic neurons in the VTA or SNr. But since neurons were non-specifically transfected, some GABAergic neurons were infected, though the population is likely very small. In the hundreds of neurons patched in this study, only a few infected neurons were found to be GABAergic. This is a potential confound in the interpretation of results from the virus-mediated D2S or D2L studies. However, in support of the conclusion that D2S-only is insufficient for cocaine-induced plasticity, studies were conducted in the transgenic D2-Short mouse (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4 and 7</a>), where expression of D2S was driven by the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter.
