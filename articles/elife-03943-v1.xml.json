Since defects in the O-mannosylation protein glycosylation pathway are primarily responsible for dystroglycanopathies and with no established O-mannose initiated structures containing a \u03b23 linked GlcNAc known, we biochemically interrogated this human enzyme. Here we report this enzyme is not a \u03b2-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase with catalytic activity towards \u03b2-galactose but rather a \u03b2-1,4-glucuronyltransferase, designated B4GAT1, towards both \u03b1- and \u03b2-anomers of xylose. The dual-activity LARGE enzyme is capable of extending products of B4GAT1 and we provide experimental evidence that B4GAT1 is the priming enzyme for LARGE. Our results further define the functional O-mannosylated glycan structure and indicate that B4GAT1 is involved in the initiation of the LARGE-dependent repeating disaccharide that is necessary for extracellular matrix protein binding to O-mannosylated \u03b1-dystroglycan that is lacking in secondary dystroglycanopathies."
