In this study, we investigate the uncharacterized gene <i>Flattop (Fltp)</i> that is transcriptionally activated during PCP acquisition in ciliated tissues. <i>Fltp</i> knock-out mice show BB docking and ciliogenesis defects in multiciliated lung cells. Furthermore, Fltp is necessary for kinocilium positioning in monociliated inner ear hair cells. In these cells, the core PCP molecule Dishevelled 2, the BB/spindle positioning protein Dlg3, and Fltp localize directly adjacent to the apical plasma membrane, physically interact and surround the BB at the interface of the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton. Dlg3 and Fltp knock-outs suggest that both cooperatively translate PCP cues for BB positioning in the inner ear. Taken together, the identification of novel BB/spindle positioning components as potential mediators of PCP signaling might have broader implications for other cell types, ciliary disease, and asymmetric cell division."

In this study, we investigate the uncharacterized gene <i>Flattop (Fltp)</i> that is transcriptionally activated during PCP acquisition in ciliated tissues. <i>Fltp</i> knock-out mice show BB docking and ciliogenesis defects in multiciliated lung cells. Furthermore, Fltp is necessary for kinocilium positioning in monociliated inner ear hair cells. In these cells, the core PCP molecule Dishevelled 2, the BB/spindle positioning protein Dlg3, and Fltp localize directly adjacent to the apical plasma membrane, physically interact and surround the BB at the interface of the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton. Dlg3 and Fltp knock-outs suggest that both cooperatively translate PCP cues for BB positioning in the inner ear. Taken together, the identification of novel BB/spindle positioning components as potential mediators of PCP signaling might have broader implications for other cell types, ciliary disease, and asymmetric cell division."

Pioneering studies in <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Xenopus</i> have revealed that global, non-cell autonomous, and cell intrinsic signaling mechanisms act in concert to establish tissue polarity. Core PCP molecules including Van Gogh-like (Vangl1-2), Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor (Celsr1-3), Frizzled (Fzd3, 6), Dishevelled (Dvl1-3), and Prickle (Pk1-2) are localized asymmetrically at the cell cortex to provide polarity information for morphogenesis and oriented cell division. Significant progress has been made in understanding the asymmetric core PCP localization in vertebrates but it is less clear how this regulates cytoskeletal rearrangements that drive morphogenesis via tissue specific downstream effector molecules (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wallingford, 2012</a>). Thus, the identification of novel PCP effectors that indicate pathway activity and mediate signaling and/or morphogenesis will be the key to unravel the function of this molecular pathway in development and disease."

Both directly regulate ciliogenesis by mediating the assembly of the apical actin cytoskeleton but are not required for the polarized accumulation of core PCP components. The core PCP molecule Dvl2 localizes near the base of cilia and functions together with Intu and Rho GTPases to dock and polarize BBs for cilia formation and directed ciliary beating (<a href=\"#bib31\">Park et al., 2008</a>). BBs are amplified deep in the cytoplasm of multiciliated cells (MCCs) and apical plasma membrane (PM) transport depends on Dvl and the vesicle trafficking protein Sec8. Up-to-date it is not understood how core PCP molecules physically connect to effector molecules, how this leads to asymmetric membrane polarization and cytoskeletal rearrangements, and if these mechanisms are conserved among different cell types in various organs and during evolution."

Multiciliated lung cells first arise at embryonic day (E) 14.0 in the trachea as well as in the main bronchi (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jain et al., 2010</a>). Similar to the mucociliary epithelium in frog, differentiation depends on BB amplification, docking, and orientation that allows the formation of hundreds of motile cilia. The differentiation of multiciliated lung cells and the dynamics of the underlying cell biological processes can be modeled in air liquid interface (ALI) cultures of primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells (mTECs) (<a href=\"#bib51\">You et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Vladar and Stearns, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vladar et al., 2012</a>). Asymmetric localization of core PCP molecules at apical junctions regulates the orientation of motile cilia along the longitudinal tissue axis for directed beating and mucus clearing. This likely interdepends on non-cell autonomous cues and intrinsic polarized microtubule (MT) network topology (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vladar et al., 2012</a>). Currently, PCP effector molecules that link core molecules, BBs, polarized MTs, and the actin cytoskeleton have not been identified. A better understanding of these molecular processes could provide further insight into a multitude of ciliary dysfunction syndromes of the lung and other organs."

This differential localization seems not sufficient to instruct morphogenesis of actin-rich hair bundles in mammals (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jones and Chen, 2008</a>).

Knock-out analysis revealed that Fltp is required for BB docking and cilia formation in the lung as well as BB and kinocilium positioning in the IE. Using ALI cultures, we show that <i>Fltp</i> expression is induced while BBs are amplified and docked at the apical PM in differentiating MCCs. Fltp localizes next to BBs, and MT plus ends in the apical actin network and is required for efficient BB docking and cilia formation. We provide evidence that Dlg3 functions together with Fltp to position BBs and kinocilia in the inner ear. Dlg3 and Fltp physically interact with each other, the core PCP protein Dvl2, and the pericentriolar matrix protein \u03b3-Tubulin, suggesting that we have identified a novel BB positioning complex in the inner ear. Together, our data implicate that Fltp is a novel regulator important for BB docking and positioning in mono- and multiciliated cell types that acquire PCP."

LacZ reporter activity in <i>Fltp</i><sup><i>ZV/+</i></sup> animals is first detectable in the embryonic node at E7.5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), which accurately reflects endogenous mRNA expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and confirmed our previous findings (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tamplin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lange et al., 2012</a>). At E8.5\u201313.5, strong reporter activity is detected in the eye, notochord, floor plate of the neural tube, and all four choroid plexi (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>), tissues that are either mono- or multiciliated and depend on active PCP signaling. Consistent with a potential function in the PCP pathway, <i>LacZ</i> reporter activity in the IE coincides with BB docking and kinocilium positioning at E13.5 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">McKenzie et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ezan and Montcouquiol, 2013</a>). The <i>Fltp</i> reporter remains expressed during development and early postnatal life in all six sensory regions of the IE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,E,F</a>). Furthermore, <i>Fltp</i> reporter activity strongly correlates with the spatial and temporal onset of ciliogenesis in the lung trachea and the main bronchi at E14.5\u201317.5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G,H</a>). In adult lungs at postnatal day (P) 30, the dual <i>lacZ</i> and <i>H2B-Venus</i> reporter remains expressed in MCCs of the bronchioles, but not in non-ciliated cells of the alveoli (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1I,J</a>). To confirm the reporter studies, we analyzed cell type-specific and subcellular localization of the endogenous Fltp protein in the embryonic node and adult lung epithelium. Whole-mount antibody staining combined with laser scanning microscopy (LSM) on gastrula-stage embryos revealed that the Fltp protein is localized at the apical PM, TJs, primary cilia, and in the cytoplasm of node cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). Immunohistochemistry on lung sections further shows that Fltp is highly enriched at the apical cortex and in cilia of the multiciliated bronchial epithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,H\u02b9</a>). The absence of Fltp immunoreactivity in <i>Fltp</i><sup><i>ZV/ZV</i></sup> lung sections further confirmed antibody specificity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I,I\u02b9</a>). Taken together, <i>Fltp</i> reporter and endogenous expression accurately correlate with onset of PCP establishment in the embryonic node, floor plate, choroid plexi, IE, and lung, which is indicative for a function in or downstream of the PCP pathway."

Switching mTEC culture to ALI conditions induces a differentiation process of lung progenitor cells towards a MCC phenotype. During differentiation the progenitor cells pass through different maturation stages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>): Monociliated lung progenitor cells (stage I) start centrosome/BB amplification followed by BB transport and docking (stage II\u2013III) and subsequent cilia formation (stage IV) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vladar et al., 2012</a>). In these cultures, Fltp-driven H2B-Venus reporter activity is activated at the transition from stage I to stage II when centrosomes/BBs are amplified and docked in heterozygous and homozygous Fltp ALI cultures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). <i>Fltp-H2B-Venus</i> expression increases during maturation until cells are terminally differentiated. This correlates with active PCP signaling and initial asymmetric core component localization (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vladar et al., 2012</a>). Subcellular co-localization studies further revealed that Fltp is localized to the apical, but not sub-apical actin cytoskeleton and fills the gaps in the actin network from where MT-based cilia project (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013C\u02b9\u02b9\u02b9,E</a>). Moreover, Fltp co-localizes with newly synthesized MT plus ends that are labeled with anti-EB1 antibodies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Together with the direct adjacent localization of Fltp next to the pericentriolar matrix stained by \u03b3-Tubulin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), these data suggest that Fltp connects BBs and ciliary MT plus ends to the cortical actin cytoskeleton. To test this idea, we examined mTECs switched to ALI conditions from <i>Fltp</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> and <i>Fltp</i><sup><i>ZV/ZV</i></sup> mice at day two and four of differentiation qualitatively and quantitatively. <i>Fltp</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> and <i>Fltp</i><sup><i>ZV/ZV</i></sup> differentiated with comparable efficiencies and speed as measured by Fltp-driven <i>H2B-GFP</i> expression and centrosome amplification (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and a comparable number of centrosomes are formed in differentiating <i>Fltp</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> and <i>Fltp</i><sup><i>ZV/ZV</i></sup> mTECs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>), whereas BB docking and cilia formation was delayed at ALI+2 and +4 days of differentiation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Taken together, these data suggest that Fltp functions in the process of BB docking and cilia formation."

Due to PCP defects in the IE (<a href=\"#bib41\">Van Campenhout et al., 2011</a>), we hypothesized that the mammalian scaffold protein Dlg3 might be a cortical adaptor for PCP-mediated BB positioning. Due to the lack of good antibodies and tools, we generated a transgenic mouse line that constitutively expresses a Venus fluorescent protein fused to the N-terminus of Dlg3 (Dlg3-Venus) (see Supplemental \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Next, we examined the subcellular localization of the Dlg3-Venus fusion protein in relation to BB, kinocilium, stereocilia bundle, core PCP molecules, and TJs in cochlea HCs using LSM and three-dimensional reconstruction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B\u02b9,F\u2013H</a>). Dlg3 specifically localizes in a crescent shape to the bare zone around the BB and co-localizes with the core PCP component Dvl2 at lateral TJs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B\u02b9,G</a>), the area where mPins/LGN, mInsc, and G\u03b1<sub>i</sub> are localized (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ezan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Tarchini et al., 2013</a>). This suggests that Dlg3 might have a conserved function in spindle/BB positioning (<a href=\"#bib14\">Johnston et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, Fltp localizes at the interface between Dlg3 and the actin-based stereocilia bundles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E\u02b9</a>), further suggesting that Fltp might be an adaptor protein linking spindle/BB positioning proteins to the apical actin cortex."

When compared to WT (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013D\u02b9,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), the lateral crescent of Dlg3 in Fltp mutants is disturbed and BBs are not correctly positioned in the middle of the apical Dlg3 crescent (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013H\u02b9,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), implicating that Fltp binds to Dlg3 to position BBs, kinocilia, and stereocilia bundles. If Dlg3 and Fltp cooperate to position BBs, one would predict that these proteins physically interact. Dlg3 contains a central SH3 domain which could bind to the SH3 binding or PRR domain of Fltp. We tested this by co-immunoprecipitation experiments of Streptavidin-Flag (SF)-tagged Dlg3 variants and Fltp-myc variants from serum starved and ciliated HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>). These experiments suggest a physical interaction of Fltp with Dlg3, which requires the highly conserved N-terminal SH3 binding domain of Fltp, but not the SH3 domain of Dlg3 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). As Dvl2 localizes directly adjacent to Dlg3 and Fltp in the inner ear, we next examined the association of endogenous Dvl2 and \u03b3-Tubulin with overexpressed SF full-length Fltp and SF-Dlg3 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). The interaction of Dvl2 with Dlg3 and Fltp and \u03b3-Tubulin with Dvl2 and Dlg3 suggests that these proteins form a complex during BB transport and positioning. Finally, we tested the predicted requirement of Dlg3 for BB positioning by knock-out analysis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8K,L</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that Dlg3 is a BB positioning protein that is anchored at apical TJs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Van Campenhout et al., 2011</a>) and cooperates with Fltp to position BB at the apical cortex of HCs in the cochlea at E18.5."

Although actin and MT interactions need to be thoroughly controlled in virtually all cell types in different cell cycle phases across species from yeast to humans, it is surprising that not many adaptor proteins that mediate such interactions are identified (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rodriguez et al., 2003</a>). These global cytoskeletal rearrangements underlie many fundamental morphogenetic processes in which cellular asymmetries need to be established and maintained, such as tissue morphogenesis, cell migration, or BB and spindle positioning in post-mitotic and mitotic cells, respectively (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wallingford, 2012</a>).

                                "text": "Several lines of evidence suggest that Fltp is a potential PCP effector regulating the cytoskeleton. First, the <i>Fltp</i> gene and reporter are expressed in several tissues known to depend on active PCP signalling, such as the node, ependymal cells, floor plate, lung, eye, and IE. Second, <i>Fltp</i> expression kinetic correlates with dynamic PCP acquisition, terminal differentiation, and cellular morphogenesis in the lung and the IE. Third, the double knock-out of <i>Fltp</i> and the core PCP gene <i>Celsr1</i> show a more severe PCP phenotype than both single mutants, raising the possibility that both genes act in the same pathway, which needs further confirmation. If this is the case, then Fltp seems to be a downstream effector molecule in the PCP pathway, as it is not required for PCP establishment, but rather for cell intrinsic PCP transduction leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements. This is supported by the fact that phenotypes observed for the PCP effectors Intu and Fuz in the mucociliary epithelium of the frog and Fltp in the murine lung are strikingly similar (<a href=\"#bib30\">Park et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2008</a>). Additionally, spindle positioning rather than core PCP mutant phenotypes mirrors the Fltp mutant phenotype in the IE (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ezan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Tarchini et al., 2013</a>). Finally, Fltp is localized at the interface of spindle positioning complexes that capture MT plus ends and connect to the PM and the apical actin cytoskeleton. Loss of Fltp leads to failure in BB docking and positioning most probably through disconnection of the BB, MT, and actin cytoskeleton in the mammalian lung and IE. Although the mechanisms of Fltp action in these two tissues might differ, a common theme seems that Fltp acts at the interface of the MT and actin cytoskeleton for BB docking and positioning, which we discuss in the following sections."

In both terminally differentiated cell types, core PCP molecules are asymmetrically localized at the apical PM and translate long-range PCP signals into cell intrinsic cytoskeletal changes that coordinate BB docking and positioning as well as cilia formation in mono- and multiciliated cells. In MCCs of the frog skin the PCP effector proteins Intu and Fuz have been shown to control ciliogenesis and together with Dvl control apical docking and planar polarization of BBs by coordinating apical actin assembly (<a href=\"#bib30\">Park et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2008</a>). It was further suggested that the PCP effector Fuz and Dvl2 control membrane trafficking and vesicle fusion at the BB essential for ciliogenesis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Park et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gray et al., 2009</a>). Studying Fltp function in the ALI primary cell culture system allowed us to link the onset of <i>Fltp</i> expression to the time of BB amplification, docking, and cilia formation. In MCCs, we have shown a close association of Fltp with the apical actin\u2013MT cytoskeleton and BBs. Fltp localization at the apical surface is reminiscent of Dvl, Sec8, and Intu localization in frog multiciliated mucociliary epithelium (<a href=\"#bib30\">Park et al., 2006</a>). Lack of Fltp function leads to BB docking defects and reduced number of cilia formed at the apical PM in ALI cultures and in vivo. Fltp physically interacts with Dlg3 and the core PCP molecule Dvl2, which regulates BB transport together with proteins of the secretory pathway (<a href=\"#bib31\">Park et al., 2008</a>). We have previously shown that Dlg3 is the only Dlg family member that is monoubiquitinated by Nedd4 and Nedd4-like E3 ligases. This is required for apical PM transport mediated by the motor protein Dynein IC and Sec8, a component of the exocyst complex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Van Campenhout et al., 2011</a>). Thus, taken together, these findings suggest that Fltp cooperates with Dlg and Dvl family members to regulate apical BB transport and docking of BBs in multiciliated tissues. However, there is likely not a strong parallel between BB docking in MCCs and BB positioning in the IE, a topic which needs to be addressed in the future."

                                "text": "To better understand the function of Fltp, we further focused our analysis on the IE as a well-described model for PCP. It was previously shown that core PCP molecules localize to distinct apical membrane compartments, but differential localization seems not sufficient to instruct morphogenesis of actin-rich hair bundles (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jones and Chen, 2008</a>). Instead, BB as well as kinocilium formation and positioning is essential for hair bundle morphogenesis, which is regulated by opposing localization of spindle positioning proteins and apical polarity proteins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ezan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Tarchini et al., 2013</a>). mInsc, mPins/LGN, and G\u03b1<sub>i</sub> localize in a microvilli-free zone (bare zone) at the lateral side, whereas the apical polarity complex consisting of Partitioning defective 3 and 6 (Par3, 6) as well as atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) localize at the medial side. Surprisingly, localization of spindle proteins was not affected in the classical PCP mutants (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ezan et al., 2013</a>), which either suggests redundancy in the PCP pathway or alternative mechanisms that position spindle proteins and BBs in the IE. We provide evidence that Fltp and Dlg3 position BBs and stereocilia bundles in the IE in addition to G\u03b1<sub>i</sub>, mPins/LGN, and mInsc, suggesting that we have identified important new molecules for BB/spindle positioning in mammals. Dlg3 and Fltp together surround the BB and anchor this organelle asymmetrically to the apical cortex likely via Dvl2 and TJ-associated proteins on the one side and attachment to the apical actin cytoskeleton on the other side. We have recently shown that the scaffold protein Dlg3 is important for apical polarity and TJ formation by interaction with a number of TJ-associated proteins (<a href=\"#bib41\">Van Campenhout et al., 2011</a>). In the fruit fly, Dlg, Mushroom body defective (Mud), and Pins are absolutely necessary for spindle positioning in various cell types in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bellaiche et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Johnston et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bergstralh et al., 2013</a>). The co-localization of G\u03b1<sub>i</sub>, mPins/LGN and mInsc, and Dlg3-Venus in the bare zone further suggests that also in mammals these proteins act in concert to position BBs and spindles. Furthermore, the basolateral polarity complex consisting of Dlg, Lgl, and Scrib is known to establish membrane domains by reciprocal inhibitory interactions with the apical aPKC-Par3/6 polarity complex and to regulate A\u2013B spindle positioning (<a href=\"#bib17\">Knoblich, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Siller and Doe, 2008</a>). These reciprocal inhibitory interactions of the apical and basolateral polarity complex at the apical surface further stabilized the positioning of BBs at the apical PM. But how spindle positioning complexes are linked to the actin cytoskeleton is still a mystery in mammals. In yeast, MT plus ends are captured by Kar9a, which binds directly to a type V myosin motor bound to actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib18\">Korinek et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lee et al., 2000</a>). As described above, Fltp functions very likely as a molecular adaptor protein localized between the interface of spindle positioning complexes and the apical actin cytoskeleton. Loss of Fltp function leads to disconnection of MT-based kinocilium and actin-based stereocilia bundles. Together, this suggests that Fltp couples BB/spindle positioning proteins to core PCP molecules and to the actin cytoskeleton in the IE. Further studies have to be conducted to precisely clarify how this complex is anchored to the cytoskeleton and core PCP components."

This emphasizes that PCP acquisition and remodeling of the actin- and MT-based cytoskeleton is crucially important for the maturation and function of terminally differentiated cell-types in tissues and organs. Consequently, mutations of both core PCP and effector molecules lead to a wide spectrum of ciliary dysfunction syndromes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gerdes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wallingford, 2012</a>). For instance, in primary cilia dyskinesia, lack of directed mucociliary clearance and recurrent respiratory tract infections can eventually progress to permanent lung damage (<a href=\"#bib38\">Storm van's Gravesande and Omran, 2005</a>). The <i>Fltp</i> knock-out mouse shows BB docking and cilia formation defects in MCCs of the lung as well as terminal airway constrictions. This suggests that human <i>FLTP</i> might be mutated in lung disease, a hypothesis that we are currently testing with our clinical partners. Moreover, mutation of Fltp leads to a stereocilia morphogenesis defect in the cochlea of the IE, which suggests that mutation of <i>FLTP</i> can cause hearing loss in human. Mutations in human <i>DLG3</i> are associated with X-linked mental retardation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lickert and Van Campenhout, 2012</a>) and we have previously identified that the scaffolding protein Dlg3 regulates apical polarity and TJ formation as well as PCP in the IE (<a href=\"#bib41\">Van Campenhout et al., 2011</a>). In this study, we have shown that Fltp and Dlg3 cooperate in BB positioning in the IE. As <i>Drosophila</i> Dlg acts as a tumor suppressor regulating proliferation and asymmetric cell division (<a href=\"#bib14\">Johnston et al., 2009</a>), it is well possible that the Fltp\u2013Dlg3 complex is involved in similar cellular processes in mammals. Indeed, we have evidence that Fltp regulates cell division of intestinal stem cells (B\u00f6ttcher and Lickert, in preparation), suggesting that we identified a novel molecule with brought implication for ciliary disease and stem cell-mediated tissue homeostasis."

In fltp mutant MCCs, BBs fail to dock, and in mutant cochlea, BB/kinocilia are mispositioned and stereocilia bundles are misoriented and distorted. Fltp localizes apically in both cell types. The authors also describe, using a mutant, a function for Dlg3 in orienting BB/kinocilia. Finally, they show that transfected Fltp and Dlg3 co-IP, and that gamma tubulin and Dvl2 are also pulled down. These data could perhaps make a reasonable story that Fltp is involved in BB positioning in several cell types.

Care must be taken that these are representative. Therefore the quantitative data are essential. The MTEC data from day2 and day4 shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</a> are at best, extremely confusing, and at worst, suggest the possibility that the results should be discarded. First, it is unclear what the authors are measuring. The number of BBs? The number or percent of docked BBs? Number of cells with docked BBs? This must be made clear. Furthermore, in this highly reproducible system, at ALI+2 days, there are only very few cells with multiple cilia, yet the authors' data seem to suggest that 80% of the cells are multiciliated (to completion??). In the best wildtype cultures, 80% of cells are never seen to become multiciliated. Furthermore, by day 4, the number has declined to 60%? Why? At this stage, the numbers should still be increasing. In light of this, how are we to interpret the mutant results? We need a description of what is being measured, as well as images to corroborate."

Genetic interaction is typically shown between heterozygotes that have no phenotype on their own, or between one het with no phenotype and a homozygote with a weak phenotype. The authors make double homozygous mutants and show an enhanced phenotype. Yet each homozygote has a phenotype of its own, and therefore the result could simply be an additive phenotype. The result therefore DOES NOT show a genetic interaction and provides NO EVIDENCE that Fltp is in the PCP pathway. The result is equally consistent with distinct pathways converging on a shared output. Numerous other statements describing Fltp function in PCP signaling are also misleading. For example, describing Dvl2 function at BBs as a PCP function is not valid. Indeed, the MCC phenotype is not a PCP phenotype at all, and the hair cell phenotype impacts PCP, but is presumably quite downstream. Taken together, it is not reasonable to describe the results as being effectors of PCP. This is another big example of interpretation not correctly reflecting the findings."

We hypothesize that this rapid increase in stage II-IV cells is due to the presence of MCCs before the switch to ALI conditions. These cells might also more efficiently show BB docking and cilia formation. Additionally, new stage I cells are entering the differentiation process after switch to ALI conditions. The amount of these cells increases and potentially reduce the number of docked stage IV cells at day 4. To definitively proof this hypothesis, we would need to do live cell analysis, which is beyond the scope of this work. The number of differentiating cells are still increasing."
