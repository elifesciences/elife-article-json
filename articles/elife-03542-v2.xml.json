These sequential representations have been suggested to result from temporally coordinated synaptic interactions within and between cell assemblies. Instead, we find through simulations and analysis of experimental data that rate and phase coding in independent neurons is sufficient to explain the organization of CA1 population activity during theta states. We show that CA1 population activity can be described as an evolving traveling wave that exhibits phase coding, rate coding, spike sequences and that generates an emergent population theta rhythm. We identify measures of global remapping and intracellular theta dynamics as critical for distinguishing mechanisms for pacemaking and coordination of sequential population activity. Our analysis suggests that, unlike synaptically coupled assemblies, independent neurons flexibly generate sequential population activity within the duration of a single theta cycle."

These sequential representations have been suggested to result from temporally coordinated synaptic interactions within and between cell assemblies. Instead, we find through simulations and analysis of experimental data that rate and phase coding in independent neurons is sufficient to explain the organization of CA1 population activity during theta states. We show that CA1 population activity can be described as an evolving traveling wave that exhibits phase coding, rate coding, spike sequences and that generates an emergent population theta rhythm. We identify measures of global remapping and intracellular theta dynamics as critical for distinguishing mechanisms for pacemaking and coordination of sequential population activity. Our analysis suggests that, unlike synaptically coupled assemblies, independent neurons flexibly generate sequential population activity within the duration of a single theta cycle."

During navigation, populations of place cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus generate phase sequences structured around the theta rhythm (e.g., <a href=\"#bib66\">Skaggs et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dragoi and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Foster and Wilson, 2007</a>). As an animal moves through the firing field of a single CA1 neuron, there is an advance in the phase of its action potentials relative to the extracellular theta cycle (<a href=\"#bib55\">O'Keefe and Recce, 1993</a>). Thus, populations of CA1 neurons active at a particular phase of theta encode the animal's recent, current, or future positions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). One explanation for these observations is that synaptic output from an active cell assembly ensures its other members are synchronously activated and in addition drives subsequent activation of different assemblies to generate a phase sequence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Harris, 2005</a>). We refer to this as the <i>coordinated assembly hypothesis</i>. An alternative possibility is that independent single cell coding is sufficient to account for population activity. According to this hypothesis, currently active assemblies do not determine the identity of future assemblies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We refer to this as the <i>independent coding hypothesis</i>."

While considerable experimental evidence has been suggested to support the coordinated assembly hypothesis (e.g., <a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dragoi and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Foster and Wilson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Maurer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gupta et al., 2012</a>), the extent to which complex sequences of activity in large neuronal populations can be accounted for by independent coding is not clear. To address this we developed phenomenological models of independent and coordinated place cell activity during navigation. In the independent coding model, the spiking activity of each cell is generated by rate coding across its place field and phase precession against a fixed theta rhythm. We show that in this model phase coding generates a traveling wave which propagates through the population to form spike sequences. This wave is constrained by a slower moving modulatory envelope which generates spatially localized place fields. In the coordinated assembly model, the spikes generated by each cell are also influenced by the activity of other cells in the population. As a result, population spike patterns are further entrained by population interactions which counter the effects of single cell spike time variability and increase the robustness of theta sequences."

We show that the independent coding model is sufficient to replicate experimental data previously interpreted as evidence for the coordinated assembly hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dragoi and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Foster and Wilson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Maurer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gupta et al., 2012</a>), despite the absence of coordination within or between assemblies. Moreover, novel analyses of experimental data support the hypothesis that place cells in CA1 code independently. Independent coding leads to new and experimentally testable predictions for membrane potential oscillations and place field remapping that distinguish circuit mechanisms underlying theta sequences. In addition we show that, despite the apparent advantage of coordinated coding in generating robust sequential activity patterns, it suffers from an inability to maintain these patterns in a novel environment. Thus, a key advantage of sequence generation through independent coding is to allow flexible global remapping of population activity while maintaining the ability to generate coherent theta sequences in multiple environments."

While a phenomenological model of CA1 phase precession has previously been developed (<a href=\"#bib22\">Geisler et al., 2010</a>), several features of this model limit its utility for investigation of coordination across neuronal populations. First, the previous model addresses only the temporal dynamics of single unit activity and population average activity, without addressing the spatiotemporal patterns of spiking activity within the population, the nature of which is a central question in the present study. Second, the previous model assumes coordination between cells in the form of fixed temporal delays and is formulated for a fixed running speed. In contrast, we wish to understand in detail the temporal relationships between cells arising in populations with no direct coordination and how these temporal relationships might depend on factors such as running speed. We therefore develop a model of a single cell with a given place field and phase code and proceed to derive the patterns of population activity under the independent coding hypothesis. To do this, we modeled the firing rate field for each neuron using a Gaussian tuning curve:"

While the rat moves through the environment, the spatial tuning curves <i>r</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>(<i>x</i>) generate a slow moving \u2018bump\u2019 of activity which, by definition, is comoving with the rat (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, top, black). Simultaneously, the phasic component <i>r</i><sub><i>\u03d5</i></sub>(<i>\u03d5</i>(<i>x</i>),<i>\u03b8</i>(<i>t</i>)) instantiates a traveling wave (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, top, red). Due to the precession of <i>\u03d5</i>(<i>t</i>), the wave propagates forward through the network at a speed faster than the bump, resulting in sequential activation of cells along a trajectory on a compressed timescale. The slower bump of activity acts as an envelope for the traveling wave, limiting its spatial extent to one place field (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, bottom). The continuous forward movement of the traveling wave is translated into discrete, repeating theta sequences via a shifting phase relationship to the slow moving component (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Moreover, this shifting phase relationship generates global theta oscillations at exactly the LFP frequency that cells were defined to precess against (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, top panel). Thus, our model can be recast in terms of the dynamics of a propagating wavepacket comprising two components, with network theta resulting from their interaction. While we define single cells to precess against a reference theta rhythm (i.e., the LFP), we now see that this same reference oscillation emerges from the population, despite the higher frequencies of individual cells."

However, in contrast to previous models, our model based on single cell coding principles allows an analysis in which only place field configurations and navigational trajectories are required to fully predict at any running speed both the global theta oscillation and the detailed population dynamics. Experimental data show that the frequency of LFP theta oscillations is relatively insensitive to the running speed of the animal, showing a mild increase with running speed compared to a larger single unit increase (<a href=\"#bib23\">Geisler et al., 2007</a>).

While single cell rate and phase tuning curves in this coordinated assembly model are identical to those in the independent coding model, a peer weight function also modulates the probability of a spike occurring in each cell depending on the spikes of its peers (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Appendix: A4). In this model, asymmetric excitation stabilizes the temporal relationship between sequentially activated assemblies, while feedback inhibition between place cells normalizes firing rates (cf. <a href=\"#bib69\">Tsodyks et al., 1996</a>). The resulting sequences are considerably more robust than those generated by independent coding with the same single cell properties (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>). Assembly interactions also amplify theta oscillations in the network (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Stark et al., 2013</a>).

A useful measure of the coding properties of place cell populations is to test how accurately single unit activity can be predicted from different variables. If, after accounting for all known single cell coding properties, predictions of the activity of individual place cells can be further improved by information about firing by their peer cells, it is likely that such cells are interacting through cell assemblies (<a href=\"#bib26\">Harris, 2005</a>). Initial analysis of CA1 place cell firing suggested this is the case, with coordination between cells at the gamma timescale being implicated (<a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al., 2003</a>). Because this improved predictability directly implies interactions between CA1 neurons, it would constitute strong evidence against the independent coding hypothesis. However, in accounting for single cell phase coding properties, the prediction analysis of <a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al. (2003)</a> assumed that firing phase is independent of movement direction in an open environment. In contrast, more recent experimental data show that in open environments firing phase always precesses from late to early phases of theta, so that firing phase at a specific location depends on the direction of travel (<a href=\"#bib31\">Huxter et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Climer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jeewajee et al., 2014</a>).

However, prediction based on place fields and directional phase fields outperforms both of these metrics (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, red). Therefore, previous evidence for intra-assembly coordination can be explained by a failure to account for the phase dependence of CA1 firing. Instead, our analysis indicates that independent phase precession of CA1 neurons is sufficient to account for observations concerning membership of CA1 assemblies. We also find that nondirectional phase fields (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), as assumed by (<a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al., 2003</a>), yield little improvement in predictability of a neuron's firing compared with predictions based on the place field alone, and for high phase locking are detrimental (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, blue vs black). While <a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al.

The quality of this prediction is dependent on the timescale at which peer activity is included in the analysis, so that the optimal timescale for peer prediction provides a measure of the temporal resolution of assembly formation. In experimental data the optimal timescale for peer prediction is approximately 20 ms, which corresponds to the gamma rhythm and the membrane time constant of CA1 neurons (<a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al., 2003</a>). We find that in the independent coding model the optimal peer prediction timescale depends strongly on phase locking (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Even though the model does not incorporate gamma oscillations or neuronal membrane properties, high values of phase locking also show a striking peak in peer predictability around the 20 ms range (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We show below that for running speeds in the range 35\u201375 cm/s phase locking is likely to lie within the range at which the observed 20 ms prediction timescale dominates. Thus, the 20 ms timescales found both here and experimentally are explainable as a signature of the common, independent phase locking of place cells to the theta rhythm, rather than transient gamma coordination or intrinsic properties of CA1 neurons."

We therefore investigated whether the independent coding or coordinated assembly model would better account for the results of these studies. We focus initially on the path length encoded by spike sequences, which we define as the length of trajectory represented by the sequence of spikes within a single theta cycle. Experimental data show that this path length varies with running speed (<a href=\"#bib42\">Maurer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gupta et al., 2012</a>), but it is not clear whether this phenomenon is a feature of independent coding or instead results from coordination between assemblies. To address this we first derived analytical approximations to the sequence path length for strong phase coding, where <i>k</i> \u2192 \u221e (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Appendix: A2). This analysis predicts a linear increase in sequence path length with running speed, but with a lower gradient than that found experimentally (<a href=\"#bib42\">Maurer et al., 2012</a>). Hence, independent coding with strong phase locking does not quantitatively explain the changes in sequence properties with running speed."

Following again the methods used by <a href=\"#bib42\">Maurer et al.

However, performing the same shuffling analysis on data generated by our independent coding model also reduced sequence correlations (t-test, <i>p</i> &lt; 10<sup>\u221246</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Hence, the phase\u2013position correlations are unaffected, while the time\u2013position correlations and hence sequence correlations are disrupted (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>).

In particular, it is unclear whether this shuffling procedure could be modified to obtain a test for assembly coordination with greater statistical specificity and if so, whether it would reveal assembly coordination within experimental datasets. To address these questions, we analyzed experimental data along with data generated by independent coding and coordinated assembly models, using a modified version of this shuffling procedure (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We found that the new shuffling procedure successfully detected assembly coordination with a statistical power of 81% (calculated for datasets containing the same number of sessions, cells, and sequences as our experimental dataset). When applied to experimental data from CA1, the shuffling test failed to detect any significant effect of shuffling (t-test, p = 0.28, 2436 events), as in most (74%) of the simulated independent coding datasets (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2E,F</a>).

These cell pairs were found to spike with a more reliable temporal lag within theta cycles than cell pairs whose firing rates are independent, which was interpreted as evidence for direct interactions between dependent neurons. To test whether these results are instead consistent with independent coding, we applied the analysis of lap by lap firing rate covariations to data from simulations of the independent coding model. We found a similar fraction of apparently dependent cell pairs to that reported by <a href=\"#bib14\">Dragoi and Buzs\u00e1ki (2006)</a>, despite the absence of any true dependencies between cells in the model (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Hence, this analysis artificially separates homogeneous populations of place cells into apparently dependent and independent cell pairs. Moreover, these dependent and independent cell groups displayed different spatial distributions of place fields, with dependent cell pairs generally occuring closer together on the track (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <i>p</i> = 1.8 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>). By separating a homogeneous population of cells into dependent and independent groups, the analysis therefore introduces a sampling bias, leading to dependent cell pairs having different properties. While we were unable to reproduce the analysis of the temporal lags in each group due to a lack of information provided within the original study (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), the emergence of dependent cell pairs with measurably different properties in independent coding simulations nevertheless demonstrates that these results are not indicative of interactions between neurons."

To establish whether independent coding could also account for these results, we generated data from our model and applied the sequence identification and decoding analysis reported by <a href=\"#bib25\">Gupta et al.

We found that, even for simulated data based on pure rate coding with no theta modulation (<i>k</i> = 0), large numbers of significant sequences were detected at high running speeds (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Therefore, to test the performance of the full sequence detection and Bayesian decoding protocol used by (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gupta et al., 2012</a>), we analyzed two simulated datasets\u2014one with a realistic value of phase locking (<i>k</i> = 0.5, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013D</a>, solid lines) and another with zero phase locking (i.e., no theta related activity, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013D</a>, dashed lines). In both cases, applying the reported Bayesian decoding analysis yielded similar decoded path lengths to those found experimentally (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Importantly, there was an inverse relationship between the ahead and behind lengths decoded from the simulated data, which reproduces the apparent shift in sequences ahead or behind the animal observed in experimental data (cf. Figure 4c of <a href=\"#bib25\">Gupta et al. (2012)</a>). This effect was dependent on the density of recorded place fields on the track and the threshold for the minimum number of cells in a theta cycle required for sequence selection (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As these results were obtained both in the case with realistic phase coding and in the case with only rate coding (and therefore no theta sequences), the properties of the decoded trajectories are not related to theta activity within the population. Hence, these data do not constrain models of theta activity in CA1."

Thus, neither intra- nor inter-assembly interactions are required to explain spike sequences observed in CA1 during theta states. Our analyses of experimental data along with simulations from each hypothesis render it unlikely that assembly coordination significantly shapes the structure of theta sequences or CA1 cell assemblies. Below, we investigate some functional consequences of the independent coding and coordinated assembly hypotheses and show that, despite the advantage of assembly coordination in generating robust sequential activity patterns, it suffers from severe limitations in remapping and storage of multiple spatial maps. Independent coding offers a solution to this problem, allowing flexible generation of sequential activity over multiple spatial representations."

When an animal is moved between environments, the relative locations at which place cells in CA1 fire remap independently of one another (e.g., <a href=\"#bib54\">O'Keefe and Conway, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</a>). This global remapping of spatial representations poses a challenge for generation of theta sequences through coordinated assemblies as synaptic interactions that promote formation of sequences in one environment would be expected to interfere with sequences in a second environment. Indeed, in the coordinated assembly model, simulations of remapping reduced single cell phase precession to below the level of independent cells (i.e., of an identical simulation with interactions between cells removed). Remapping in the coordinated coding model also substantially reduced firing rate and population oscillations (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This decrease in firing rate following remapping contradicts experimental data showing an increase in firing rate in novel environments (<a href=\"#bib35\">Karlsson and Frank, 2008</a>). It is not immediately clear whether the independent coding model faces similar constraints on sequence generation across different spatial representations. We therefore addressed the feasibility of maintaining theta sequences following remapping given the assumptions that underpin our independent coding model."

This scenario would occur if the phase lags associated with phase precession were generated by intrinsic network architectures (e.g., <a href=\"#bib13\">Diba and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Geisler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2013</a>) or upstream pacemaker inputs. For fixed phase lags, place cells display linear phase coding, whereby a cell continues to precess in phase outside of its rate coded firing field at a constant rate (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In this scenario, the phase lag between two neurons depends linearly on the distance between their place field centers, while cells separated by multiples of a place field width share the same phase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Each cell pair therefore has a fixed phase lag in all environments and all cells can in principle be mapped onto a single chart describing their phase ordering (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). If this mechanism for determining phase ordering is hardwired, then following arbitrary global remapping, cells with nearby place field locations will in most cases no longer share similar phases (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). As a result, theta sequences and the global population theta will in general be abolished (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). However, there exist a limited set of remappings which in this scenario do not disrupt the sequential structure of the population (e.g., <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). On a linear track, these remappings are: translation of all place fields by a fixed amount, scaling of all place fields by a fixed amount, and permuting the place field locations of any cell pair with zero phase lag."

Hence, in open environments, the notion of a phase chart must be extended to include a fixed phase ordering for each running direction. Given such a fixed phase chart, a set of remappings known as <i>affine transformations</i> preserve the correct theta dynamics (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Appendix: A7). Such remappings consist of combinations of linear transformations (scaling, shear, rotation, and reflection) and translations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>).

Moreover, this analysis demonstrates that previous models based on fixed temporal delays between cells (e.g., <a href=\"#bib13\">Diba and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Geisler et al., 2010</a>) cannot maintain theta sequences following global remapping. Nevertheless, it remains possible that CA1 theta dynamics are based on fixed phase charts, provided that multiple such phase charts are available to the network, similar to the multiple attractor charts which have been suggested to support remapping of firing rate (<a href=\"#bib63\">Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997</a>). In this case, each complete remapping recruits a different phase chart, fixing a new set of phase lags in the population. The number of possible global remappings that maintain theta sequences is then determined by the number of available phase charts. Such a possibility is consistent with recent suggestions of fixed sequential architectures (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2013</a>) and has not been ruled out in CA1.

We asked if it is possible to overcome these constraints so that phase sequences can be flexibly generated across multiple environments. We reasoned that experimental data on phase precession only imply that phase precesses within a cell's firing field and need not constrain a cell's phase outside of its firing field. We therefore implemented a version of the independent coding model in which firing phase has a sigmoidal relationship with location (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013B</a>, solid line; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Appendix: A5), such that phase precesses within the firing field but not outside of the field. In this case, each cell's intrinsic frequency increases as the animal enters the spatial firing field and drops back to LFP frequency when the animal exits the firing field (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, solid line). This is in contrast to the linear phase model and previous work with fixed delays (<a href=\"#bib22\">Geisler et al., 2010</a>) in which each cell's intrinsic frequency is always faster than the population oscillation, both inside and outside of the place field (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, dashed line). In a given environment, spike phase precession and sequence generation in a population of cells with sigmoidal phase coding (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013F</a>) are similar to models in which cells have linear phase coding. However, in addition, sigmoidal phase coding enables theta sequences to be generated after any arbitrary global remapping (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). This flexible global remapping is in contrast to the scrambling of theta sequences following global remapping when cells have linear phase coding (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). Thus, independent sigmoidal coding is able to account for CA1 population activity before and after global remapping."

Therefore the intrinsic phase <i>\u03d5</i> of each cell in our model (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>) can be interpreted as MPO phase. While data concerning the MPO phase outside of the firing field are limited, such data would likely distinguish generation of theta sequences based on a linear and sigmoidal phase coding. If CA1 implements linear phase coding, then the MPO of each cell should precess linearly in time against LFP theta at a fixed (velocity dependent) frequency, both when the animal is inside the place field and when the animal is at locations where the cell is silent (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>, dashed line). Alternatively, sigmoidal phase coding predicts that precession of the MPO against the LFP occurs only inside the firing rate field (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>, solid line) and that the MPO drops back to the LFP frequency outside of the place field (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, solid line) as reported by <a href=\"#bib28\">Harvey et al. (2009)</a>. A further prediction of sigmoidal coding is that, in contrast to models based on fixed delays (<a href=\"#bib13\">Diba and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Geisler et al., 2010</a>), the phase lag between any two cells changes when the animal moves through their place fields. Outside their place fields the cells are synchronized with each other and with the LFP, whereas a dynamically shifting phase lag develops as the animal crosses the place fields (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Finally, phase precession under the sigmoidal model behaves differently to the linear model in open environments. In the linear model, the phase chart fixes a different population phase ordering for each running direction, so that spike phase depends on the location of the animal and the instantaneous direction of movement. In the sigmoidal model, however, each cell has a location dependent frequency, so that the spike phase depends on the complete trajectory through the place field and no explicit directional information is required (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Appendix: A6). Rather, the directional property of the sequence arises purely through a location dependent oscillation frequency in each cell combined with the trajectory of the animal through each place field. In summary, our analysis demonstrates how evaluation of theta sequences following global remapping and of theta phase within and outside of a cell's firing field will be critical for distinguishing models of CA1 assemblies and theta generation."

Amplitude modulation of the envelope provides a mechanism for multiplexing spatial with nonspatial information, such as task specific memory items (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wood et al., 2000</a>) and sensory inputs (<a href=\"#bib60\">Renn\u00f3-Costa et al., 2010</a>). The independence of each neuron naturally explains the robustness of phase precession against intrahippocampal perturbations (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zugaro et al., 2005</a>), an observation which is difficult to reconcile with models based on assembly interactions. Depending on the exact nature of the single cell phase code, independent phase coding can enable theta sequences to be maintained with arbitrary global remapping. This flexibility may maximize the number and diversity of spatial representations that CA1 can provide to downstream structures, offering a strong functional advantage over mechanisms based on interactions between cell assemblies."

First, an absence of coordination within or between assemblies has the advantage that neural interactions do not interfere with sequence generation after global remapping. Rather, for independent coding models the constraints on sequence generation following remapping arise from the nature of the phase code. With linear phase coding the set of sequences available to the network is fixed, resulting in a limited set of place field configurations with a particular mathematical structure (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Interestingly, the remappings observed in grid modules (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fyhn et al., 2007</a>), but not CA1, are consistent with those predicted for networks with a single fixed set of theta phase lags called a phase chart. These findings, together with the fact that the temporal delays between cells depend on running speed, argue against previous models based on fixed delays within CA1 populations (<a href=\"#bib13\">Diba and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Geisler et al., 2010</a>). Nevertheless, more complex scenarios with multiple phase charts could explain CA1 population activity during theta oscillations and \u2018preplay\u2019, which suggests a limited remapping capacity for CA1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2013</a>). Alternatively, sigmoidal phase coding massively increases the flexibility for global remapping as cells can remap arbitrarily while maintaining coherent theta sequences within each spatial representation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Second, linear and sigmoidal phase coding predict distinct MPO dynamics. With linear phase coding, the temporal frequency of each MPO is independent of the animal's location. With sigmoidal phase coding, the MPO frequency increases inside the place field, so that phase precession occurs inside but not outside the place field. In this case, only the spiking assembly behaves as a traveling wave, whereas the MPOs of cells with place fields distant from the animal are phase locked to the LFP. Sigmoidal phase precession could emerge due to inputs from upstream structures (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chance, 2012</a>) or be generated intrinsically in CA1 place cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Leung, 2011</a>). Finally, in contrast to linear phase coding populations, sigmoidal phase coding populations do not require additional information from head direction or velocity cells to generate directed theta sequences in open environments. Instead, sigmoidal theta sequences are determined solely by the recent trajectory of the rat through the set of place fields together with a location dependent oscillation frequency, consistent with recent observations of reversed theta sequences during backwards travel (<a href=\"#bib75\">Cei et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Maurer et al., 2014</a>). In summary therefore, these two models may be distinguished experimentally on the basis of observations of the number of non-affine remappings in CA1, the intracellular frequency and delay between place cells as a function of location and of the dependence of firing phase on the trajectory through a place field in open environments."

In this situation each cell's activity depends on the phase of the LFP theta rhythm and on the temporal location within an \u2018episode field\u2019 rather than a place field. Our model can be applied equally well to these internally generated sequences if the rate coded episode field is assumed to have a similar temporal structure to a place field. An entirely different class of sequences, however, is observed during non-theta states such as sharp wave ripples (SWR) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buzs\u00e1ki et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Diba and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2007</a>). In contrast to theta sequences, SWR sequences are generally observed during states of immobility and are believed to arise from synchronous discharge in CA3 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buzs\u00e1ki et al., 1983</a>). Because SWR sequences are generated without co-occurence of longer time-scale firing fields or theta oscillations, they cannot be accounted for by the independent coding schemes that we investigate here, in which rate and phase information determine the activity of each cell. Instead, the nature of cell assemblies in CA1 may be highly state dependent, operating in at least two modes. During theta states, sequences are generated by independently precessing neurons, whereas during SWRs sequences may result from interactions between consecutively activated cell assemblies."

This dissociation between rate and phase coding can be accounted for in our model by assuming that rate fields are maintained while phase fields are disrupted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) or the degree of phase locking (<i>k</i>) is substantially reduced (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Nevertheless, by demonstrating that existing observations of population sequences can be explained by independent coding our model argues against mechanisms for phase precession that rely on synaptic coordination at theta time scales (e.g., <a href=\"#bib69\">Tsodyks et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Maurer and McNaughton, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lisman and Redish, 2009</a>). In contrast, our model does not distinguish between specific single cell mechanisms for phase precession such as dual oscillators (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lengyel et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Burgess et al., 2007</a>), depolarizing ramps (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mehta et al., 2002</a>), intrinsic membrane currents (<a href=\"#bib40\">Leung, 2011</a>) or dual inputs from CA3 and entorhinal cortex (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chance, 2012</a>). Our model is also consistent with inheritance of phase precession in CA1 from upstream circuits in CA3 and entorhinal cortex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jaramillo et al., 2014</a>). However, it argues against the possibility that CA1 inherits coordinated sequences from CA3 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jaramillo et al., 2014</a>). It is possible that CA3 nevertheless generates sequences by synaptic coordination. Because CA3 neurons are connected by dense recurrent collaterals (<a href=\"#bib50\">Miles and Wong, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Le Duigou et al., 2014</a>), there are likely to be substantial correlations in their output to CA1, which could induce deviations from the independent population code outlined here. However, feedback inhibition motifs such as those found in CA1 may counteract such correlations (<a href=\"#bib59\">Renart et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tetzlaff et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bernacchia and Wang, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">King et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sippy and Yuste, 2013</a>). Hence, the local inhibitory circuitry in CA1 may actively remove correlations present in its input in order to generate an independent population code (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ecker et al., 2010</a>)."

In particular, a downstream decoder with access to an independent population code need only extract the stereotyped correlational patterns associated with traveling waves under a given place field mapping. In this way it can flexibly decode activity across a large number of spatial representations. Decoding in the presence of additional correlations would likely lead to a loss of information (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zohary et al., 1994</a>). While this loss can to some extent be limited by including knowledge of these additional correlations (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nirenberg and Latham, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Eyherabide and Samengo, 2013</a>), this likely requires a high level of specificity and therefore a lack of flexibility in the decoder.

In the above equation, the notation follows that of <a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al.

Our simulations showed that, using the methods of <a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al. (2003)</a>, the phase locking parameter <i>k</i> was underestimated outside of the place field center. Misestimation of phase field parameters introduces false peer predictability in simulated datasets. We therefore replaced their location dependent estimation with a fixed value equal to the phase locking estimated in regions where the place field is over 2/3 its maximum value. We also found that the 5 cm spatial smoothing kernel used by <a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al. (2003)</a> resulted in a high level of spurious peer prediction in simulations based on independent coding, since it extended the boundaries of place fields, allowing non-overlapping peer cells to compensate via inhibitory weights. A smaller kernel of 3.5 cm reduced the rate of false positive for peer prediction and was therefore used instead. We simulated 300 cells in each session of which we randomly sampled 15 for analysis in order to match the number of place cells typically recorded experimentally. 28 laps were simulated for each session and 10 sessions were simulated in total (representing the two running directions over the five experimental sessions we analyzed). Peer prediction was performed at a timescale of 25 ms (the optimal timescale in <a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al. (2003)</a>)."

In the case of Foster and Wilson, the authors find that shuffling their model data as reported in that paper reduces correlations indicative of theta sequences, demonstrating that this result can in fact be obtained from independent neurons. Interestingly, the authors note that the method reported in the original paper may be modified to be a stronger test of non-independence. As reported it remains to be seen whether if, with this modified shuffling procedure, correlations would be reduced."

It is thus a useful tool that sharpens the interpretation of such data sets, and suggests new analyses and experiments moving forward. The exploration of the relationship between theta sequences and remapping is thoughtful and generates useful testable predictions."

However, the model is mainly descriptive, meaning it describes and characterizes the phenomenon of phase precession, but does not provide any new insights into the underlying mechanisms of phase precession, nor any new insights into how information is encoded in the hippocampus. The equations used to predict the firing rates of CA1 cells are very similar to equations used in previous studies of phase precession (the authors even cite some of these references). While I do think that having a clear description of phase precession and the implications that the existence of this phenomenon has on activity patterns within CA1 would be useful to the field, such a discussion is almost more appropriate for a review paper rather than a research article. Also, the manuscript is rather dense with concepts that are specific to temporal coding in the hippocampus. I am not sure how understandable this paper would be to those outside of this field."

First, our model allows an analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns of population activity, whereas Geisler et al. only investigated the temporal dynamics of single unit and population average activity. This is important because it allows analysis of theta sequences at the population level, which is central to the new advances made by our study. Second, our model generates realistic activity at arbitrary running speeds, while the fixed phase lags assumed by Geisler et al. are inconsistent with experimental data if running speeds are allowed to vary. Third, our model allows systematic variation of the phase locking of cells against the theta rhythm, leading to novel predictions for sequence properties, including a dependence of the decoded sequence path length and propagation speed on phase locking (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a> in our original and revised manuscripts).

Thus, while the origin of the theta frequency oscillation is not central to our main conclusions, the reviewer identifies an element of our model that, because it is conceptually similar to that of Geisler et al., we perhaps did not explain sufficiently clearly. In our single cell model, we define neurons to precess in phase against a reference theta rhythm. As a result, each neuron oscillates at a velocity-dependent frequency which is always higher than that of the reference theta. Regardless of velocity, however, we find that the global population activity oscillates at the same frequency as the reference theta, i.e. at a lower frequency than each individual cell. Our use of the word \u201cgenerate\u201d is restricted to this scenario, where the network theta is \u201cgenerated\u201d from the sum of the higher frequency oscillations in each neuron.

For example, the method for isolating the central cloud (their Figure 2B) from the overall CCG plot (their Figure 2A) was not disclosed. Nevertheless, in attempting to reproduce their methods as closely as possible, we found that their key results could be accounted for by independent coding. First, when analyzing the correlations in lap by lap firingrates using the methods of Dragoi et al., we found a similar number of apparently dependent cell pairs as the original study, despite the absence of true firingrate correlations within the simulated data. Hence, the analysis used by Dragoi et al. artificially separates homogeneous populations of place cells into apparently dependent and independent cell pairs. Second, these dependent and independent cell groups displayed different spatial distributions of firing rate fields. This suggests that the effects reported by Dragoi et al. might result from a sampling bias introduced by the separation of a homogeneous population of cells into dependent and independent groups. Thus, as far as we can tell, the results reported by Dragoi et al. are consistent with the independent coding hypothesis. We report these new analyses in the revised manuscript (paragraph seven of subsection \u201cIndependent coding accounts for phase sequences\u201d, in the Results). We hope the reviewers and editors will also recognize the difficulty in making comparisons to previous work where that work has not been documented to a level where it can be reproduced."

We have performed additional simulations using the Gupta protocol which show that, if the number of cells simulated is sufficiently small as to match the number of cells per theta cycle reported by Gupta et al., the anticorrelation between ahead and behind length arises naturally due to the sequence selection criteria. Importantly, these results are fully reproducible for realistic values of phase locking and also for zero phase locking, where no theta sequences exist in the data (revised manuscript <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C, D</a>). We further note that the relationship between velocity and sequence path length that we presented in our original manuscript was a consequence of our assumed change in firingrate as a function of running speed. Further simulations in which the number of spikes per theta cycle does not vary with running speed produce a relationship similar to that reported by Gupta et al. (revised manuscript <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Thus, the Gupta et al. data are fully consistent with the independent coding model.
