Transition to cold temperatures requires changes in the partitioning of energy substrates, re-routing fatty acids to BAT to fuel non-shivering thermogenesis. However, the mechanisms behind the redistribution of energy substrates to BAT remain largely unknown. Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a protein that inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, is highly expressed in BAT. Here, we demonstrate that ANGPTL4 is part of a shuttling mechanism that directs fatty acids derived from circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to BAT during cold. Specifically, we show that cold markedly down-regulates ANGPTL4 in BAT, likely via activation of AMPK, enhancing LPL activity and uptake of plasma triglyceride-derived fatty acids. In contrast, cold up-regulates ANGPTL4 in WAT, abolishing a cold-induced increase in LPL activity. Together, our data indicate that ANGPTL4 is an important regulator of plasma lipid partitioning during sustained cold."

Transition to cold temperatures requires changes in the partitioning of energy substrates, re-routing fatty acids to BAT to fuel non-shivering thermogenesis. However, the mechanisms behind the redistribution of energy substrates to BAT remain largely unknown. Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a protein that inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, is highly expressed in BAT. Here, we demonstrate that ANGPTL4 is part of a shuttling mechanism that directs fatty acids derived from circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to BAT during cold. Specifically, we show that cold markedly down-regulates ANGPTL4 in BAT, likely via activation of AMPK, enhancing LPL activity and uptake of plasma triglyceride-derived fatty acids. In contrast, cold up-regulates ANGPTL4 in WAT, abolishing a cold-induced increase in LPL activity. Together, our data indicate that ANGPTL4 is an important regulator of plasma lipid partitioning during sustained cold."

Whereas WAT represents the main energy storage organ in the body, BAT is dedicated to the generation of heat via the burning of lipids. BAT is activated during cold exposure, when additional heat production is needed to maintain core body temperature. Heat production by BAT is stimulated via release of norepinephrine by the sympathetic nervous system, causing activation of \u03b2-adrenergic signalling and subsequent uncoupling of ATP production from mitochondrial respiration (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</a>). Uncoupling in BAT is mediated by the uncoupling protein UCP1, which is highly abundant specifically in BAT (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</a>). Studies in the last decade have shown the presence of BAT in humans and have provided preliminary evidence for an inverse relationship between BAT activity and parameters of obesity (<a href=\"#bib48\">van Marken Lichtenbelt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Virtanen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wang et al., 2011</a>).

In addition to circulating glucose and free fatty acids, fatty acids derived from circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) represent a major fuel source for BAT (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</a>). The liberation of fatty acids from TRLs is catalyzed by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is highly abundant in BAT (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartelt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kersten, 2014</a>). Cold exposure markedly stimulates LPL activity in BAT, causing a concomitant increase in TRL-derived fatty acid uptake and even uptake of whole lipoprotein particles (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartelt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Khedoe et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Klingenspor et al., 1996</a>). The increase in fatty acid uptake upon cold exposure, which can be mimicked by pharmacological \u00df3-adrenergic receptor activation, is highly specific for BAT, suggesting that the body may specifically re-direct lipid fuels to BAT during cold exposure (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartelt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Berb\u00e9e et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Khedoe et al., 2014</a>). Both transcriptional and (post-)translational regulation has been implicated in the increased LPL activity in BAT upon cold exposure. However, the specific underlying mechanisms have remained elusive (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carneheim et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Giralt et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mitchell et al., 1992</a>)."

In the initial paper describing the cloning of <i>Angptl4</i>, we had seen high expression of <i>Angptl4</i> mRNA in BAT (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kersten et al., 2000</a>). Since the exact mechanisms behind regulation of LPL activity in BAT upon cold exposure are currently unclear, we hypothesized that ANGPTL4 may act as an important regulator of LPL-mediated fatty acid uptake into BAT. Accordingly, in the present paper we studied the role of ANGPTL4 in lipid metabolism during cold exposure, taking advantage of <i>Angptl4</i>-deficient (<i>Angptl4</i>-/-) mice and <i>Angptl4</i>-overexpressing (<i>Angptl4</i>-Tg) mice."

The specificity of the antibody used in the immunoblotting for ANGPTL4 was demonstrated by the lack of observable signal in BAT of <i>Angptl4</i>-/- mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> - left panel). Interestingly, we detected bands for ANGPTL4 at a molecular weight of \u223c52\u2009kDa and \u223c45\u2009kDa. The expected molecular weight of ANGPTL4 protein is 45\u2009kDa, with a predicted glycosylation site at amino acid Asparagine-177 (in humans) or Asparagine 181 (in mice) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ge et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kim et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yoon et al., 2000</a>). Consistent with the notion that these bands represent glycosylated (\u223c52\u2009kDa) and non-glycosylated forms (\u223c45\u2009kDa) of ANGPTL4, the 52\u2009kDa band disappeared following treatment of BAT lysates with the endoglycosidase PGNase, while the 45\u2009kDa band became more intense (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> \u2013 right panel). These data indicate that ANGPTL4 protein is present in BAT in glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms. Immunofluorescent staining on sections from human BAT obtained during surgery (as qualified based on UCP1 staining) showed that ANGPTL4 is also expressed in human BAT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In agreement with high ANGPTL4 expression levels in BAT, <i>Angptl4</i> mRNA increased markedly upon differentiation of a mouse brown adipocyte cell line (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

                                "text": "Following cold exposure, the energy requirements of BAT increase dramatically. Two major fuel sources for BAT are plasma glucose and free fatty acids, both of which were unaltered by cold and <i>Angptl4</i> genotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>). Also, plasma glycerol, which is perhaps a better indicator of adipose tissue lipolysis than free fatty acids, was not different between the three genotypes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). Additionally, <i>ex vivo</i> treatment of differentiated primary white adipocytes with the non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol indicated a lack of effect of <i>Angptl4</i> genotype on adipose tissue lipolysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). Besides glucose and free fatty acids, circulating TG represent a major fuel for BAT during cold (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</a>). Based on the marked decrease in <i>Angptl4</i> mRNA levels in BAT upon prolonged cold exposure, we hypothesized that ANGPTL4 might play a role in the metabolism of circulating TG in BAT during cold. In line with this notion, the reduction in plasma TG visible in wild-type and <i>Angptl4</i>-/- mice in response to cold was greatly attenuated in <i>Angptl4</i>-Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>). Lipoprotein profiling by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) supported markedly augmented plasma TRL levels in cold-exposed <i>Angptl4</i>-Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2M</a>)."

                                "text": "It is well-established that cold-induced reductions in plasma TG levels are mediated by increased LPL activity in BAT (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartelt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kersten, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Klingenspor et al., 1996</a>). Accordingly, we tested whether ANGPTL4 levels influence changes in BAT LPL activity upon prolonged cold exposure. Whereas wild-type mice respond to cold with a reduction in BAT ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein levels, <i>Angptl4</i>-Tg mice maintain higher ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Mirroring the levels of ANGPTL4, the cold-induced changes in LPL activity in BAT exhibited a gradient across the three <i>Angptl4</i> genotypes, with highest LPL activity observed in <i>Angptl4</i>-/- mice and lowest LPL activity in <i>Angptl4</i>-Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Furthermore, the marked increase in LPL activity during cold observed in the wild-type mice was significantly blunted in <i>Angptl4</i>-Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Interestingly, the two-fold increase in LPL activity by cold in <i>Angptl4</i>-/- mice indicates that part of the induction of LPL activity in BAT is independent of ANGPTL4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), possibly via an increase in <i>Lpl</i> mRNA, which was observed in all three genotypes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartelt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Klingenspor et al., 1996</a>). Overall, the marked gradient in LPL activity between <i>Angptl4</i>-/-, wild-type, and <i>Angptl4</i>-Tg mice strongly suggests that ANGPTL4 acts as an inhibitor of LPL activity in BAT."

After 15 min, the mice were sacrificed and the tissue distribution of <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>14</sup>C activity was determined. As expected, cold exposure markedly increased the rate of clearance of the injected VLDL-like particles from the plasma (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). However, after cold exposure, plasma clearance of glycerol tri[<sup>3</sup>H]oleate (TRL FA), but not [<sup>14</sup>C]cholesteryl-oleate (TRL Chol), was significantly slower in <i>Angptl4</i>-Tg mice, indicating that <i>Angptl4</i>-overexpression inhibits LPL-mediated plasma TG clearance in the cold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Cold exposure caused a marked increase in TRL-derived fatty acid uptake into BAT in all three genotypes, indicating that part of the increase in fatty acid uptake is independent of ANGPTL4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). However, similar to LPL activity, a clear gradient in TRL-derived fatty acid uptake into BAT was observed between the three genotypes, with lowest uptake in <i>Angptl4</i>-Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Similar results were obtained for [<sup>14</sup>C]cholesteryl-oleate, showing a marked decrease in BAT uptake in the <i>Angptl4</i>-Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). We repeated the plasma TG clearance studies using radiolabelled lipoprotein particles with a larger diameter, resembling postprandial chylomicrons. Again, <i>Angptl4</i>-overexpression markedly reduced uptake into BAT of the TRL-derived fatty acids and the core label cholesteryl-oleyloleate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). To visualize the TRL uptake process, we injected hydrophobic fluorescent nanocrystals embedded in lipoprotein particles (QD-TRLs) into cold-exposed <i>Angptl4</i>-/-, wild-type and <i>Angptl4</i>-Tg mice (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bruns et al., 2009</a>). In agreement with a role for ANGPTL4 in TRL processing in BAT, increased accumulation of QD-TRLs was observed after cold exposure of wild-type mice, but not of <i>Angptl4</i>-Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Furthermore, <i>Angptl4</i>-/- mice show an accumulation of QD-TRLs in BAT even when maintained at 28\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Together, these data are supportive of a major role for ANGPTL4 as a regulator of LPL activity and concomitant uptake of fatty acids into BAT upon prolonged cold exposure."

Since many of the cold-induced adaptations are triggered by \u03b2-adrenergic signalling, we examined the effect of \u03b2-adrenergic activation on ANGPTL4 expression in BAT and WAT using murine BAT (T37i cells) and WAT (3T3-F442a) cell lines and primary cells (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zennaro et al., 1998</a>).

Previously, it had been shown that 5\u2019AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is progressively activated with prolonged cold exposure and that AMPK expression is significantly higher in BAT compared to WAT (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mulligan et al., 2007</a>). Consistent with this finding, we found that the catalytic \u03b1-subunits of AMPK,\u00a0as well as phosphorylation of AMPK at Threonine-172 \u2013 indicative of AMPK activity \u2013 are barely detectable in WAT in the basal state (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Viollet et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2010</a>). Previously, differential tissue expression of isoforms of the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits of the AMPK heterotrimer was suggested to determine cellular and systemic responses to different metabolic stressors (<a href=\"#bib50\">Viollet et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2010</a>). Intriguingly, we detected large differences in basal\u00a0AMPK \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunit isoform distribution between BAT and WAT and, more specifically, found a high expression of the AMPK\u03b12 catalytic subunit and the AMPK\u03b21 regulatory subunit in BAT compared to WAT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). The differences in total AMPK expression and subunit distribution may explain why WAT AMPK levels remain weak following sustained cold exposure, whereas a strong increase in AMPK and phospho-AMPK is observed in BAT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>)."

To examine the consequences of AMPK activation in BAT, we treated differentiated T37i brown adipocytes with multiple AMPK activators, including AICAR, A769662, metformin, and phenformin hydrochloride. Without exception, AMPK activation markedly down-regulated <i>Angptl4</i> mRNA expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). To further confirm the down-regulation of ANGPTL4 by AMPK, we treated different <i>in vitro</i> model systems for BAT with the AMPK activator AICAR. AICAR treatment of differentiated T37i adipocytes, BA adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Uldry et al., 2006</a>) or murine primary brown adipocytes resulted in a marked decrease in ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein levels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). Part of the inhibitory effect of AMPK activation on <i>Angptl4</i> expression in differentiated T37i adipocytes\u00a0could be rescued by siRNA-mediated knock-down of AMPK\u03b11 and AMPK\u03b12, corroborating the suppressive effect of AMPK on <i>Angptl4</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013F</a>). Consistent with the notion that the negative regulation of ANGPTL4 by AMPK is specific for BAT, AICAR treatment markedly reduced ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein levels in BAT explants, but not WAT explants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G,H</a>). Based on these data, we propose that the different amount and activation of AMPK between BAT and WAT may be the critical factor in the differential regulation of ANGPTL4 between the two tissues during sustained cold."

Indeed, we observed that AMPK activation almost completely blocked the induction of <i>Angptl4</i> mRNA following treatment with the PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Accordingly, we hypothesized that activation of AMPK following prolonged cold exposure may inhibit PPAR\u03b3-mediated transcription of the <i>Angptl4</i> gene. To examine this possibility, a luciferase construct was prepared containing the three conserved PPAR response elements (PPREs) of intron 3 of the murine <i>Angptl4</i> gene. These three PPREs have previously been shown to be responsible for PPAR-mediated up-regulation of <i>Angptl4</i> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kaddatz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mandard et al., 2004</a>). In\u00a0HepG2\u00a0cells transfected with the <i>Angptl4</i> PPRE construct , rosiglitazone treatment significantly induced luciferase activity, which was further increased upon co-transfection with <i>Ppar\u03b3</i>/Retinoid X receptor (<i>Rxr</i>). By\u00a0contrast,\u00a0co-treatment with AICAR blunted the increase in luciferase activity (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). Interestingly, whereas co-transfection of the PPAR\u03b3 co-activator <i>P300</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gelman et al., 1999</a>) further stimulated luciferase activity in the absence of AICAR, it failed to do so in the presence of AICAR, suggesting that regulation of P300 may be part of the mechanism of inhibition of ANGPTL4 by AMPK (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). In support of this possibility, treatment of brown adipocytes with AICAR resulted in phosphorylation of P300 at serine residue 89, which is known to reduce the capacity of P300 to co-activate nuclear transcription factors, whereas no change in total P300 protein levels was observed (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). Collectively, these data suggest that the negative regulation of ANGPTL4 in BAT upon cold exposure may be mediated by the inhibition of PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity by AMPK."

Since <i>Lpl</i> mRNA in BAT is only moderately increased upon prolonged cold exposure, it has been suggested that the pronounced increase in LPL activity in BAT occurs at the post-translational level (<a href=\"#bib22\">Giralt et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Klingenspor et al., 1996</a>).

Specifically, the data implicate ANGPTL4 as an important mediator of preferential shuttling of TRL-derived fatty acids to BAT during cold exposure. Via direct effects on local LPL activity and subsequent fatty acid uptake, the reciprocal regulation of ANGPTL4 in BAT and WAT assures an adequate fuel delivery to BAT during cold exposure. The differential regulation of ANGPTL4 and LPL between BAT and WAT leads to corresponding changes in fatty acid uptake from TRLs, with our data showing a clear dose-dependent and causal relationship between ANGPTL4 expression and TRL-derived fatty acid uptake into both tissues. The importance of ANGPTL4 in the regulation of LPL activity during cold complements the already established role of ANGPTL4 in regulation of LPL during fasting and exercise in WAT and skeletal muscle, respectively (<a href=\"#bib14\">Catoire et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kroupa et al., 2012</a>).

Heterotrimeric AMPK has one catalytic (\u03b1), and two regulatory (\u03b2 and \u03b3) subunits, each having distinctive isoforms with a tissue-specific distribution (<a href=\"#bib50\">Viollet et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2010</a>). Tissue-specific combinations of different subunit isoforms may confer tissue-specific properties to AMPK by determining subcellular localization and substrate targeting, thereby controlling cellular and systemic responses to metabolic stressors, including sustained cold (<a href=\"#bib50\">Viollet et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2010</a>). Indeed, with prolonged cold exposure, AMPK becomes progressively activated in BAT and only to a minor extent in WAT (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bauwens et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mulligan et al., 2007</a>)."

Similar to muscle and heart, we found the AMPK\u03b12 catalytic subunit to be abundantly present in BAT, but not WAT (<a href=\"#bib50\">Viollet et al., 2009</a>). Together, the increased AMPK activation and different AMPK subunit expression in BAT as compared to WAT may explain why the repressive effect of cold-induced AMPK activation on ANGPTL4 expression is much more pronounced in BAT than in WAT. We suggest that regulation of ANGPTL4 in WAT during cold may be dominated by activation of \u03b2-adrenergic signalling, which may explain the increase in ANGPTL4 expression observed in WAT during sustained cold exposure."

A potential link between PPAR\u03b3 and AMPK may be the modulation of co-activator recruitment to PPAR\u03b3 by AMPK. A well-established co-activator of PPAR\u03b3 that has been shown to be regulated by AMPK is P300 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gelman et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Leff, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 2001</a>). P300 is a key regulator of the assembly and mobilization of the transcriptional machinery by connecting transcription factors to the transcriptional machinery and enhancing DNA accessibility (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vo and Goodman, 2001</a>). AMPK activation enhances P300 degradation and causes phosphorylation of P300 at serine residue 89, thereby blocking the interaction of P300 with PPAR\u03b3 and reducing PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Leff, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 2001</a>).

The use of AICAR is equivocal, as other effects of AICAR have been shown to be mediated by pathways independent of AMPK and it is not a fully definitive reagent to use to solidify a conclusion about AMPK. While the data with AICAR are instructive and suggestive, the authors need to provide genetic or other evidence that AMPK is directly mediating the effect of cold exposure on ANGPTL4 expression. Providing this one additional key piece of data would greatly enhance the impact of the paper."

This issue was raised by both reviewers but no specific suggestions for experiments were raised, as both reviewers must have recognized the near impossibility of addressing that question via in vivo experiments, short of investing at least 2-3 years of intense work.

However, we recognize that it may also create confusion by not presenting a uniform phenotype of WAT, as suggested by the section title and the Abstract. Based on this consideration, we decided to remove the data on iWAT to present a more black and white story comparing BAT with regular (gonadal) WAT. Protein levels of ANGPTL4 in BAT and WAT upon cold exposure can be found in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, showing a clear decrease in ANGPTL4 protein in BAT and a clear decrease in ANGPTL4 protein in WAT by cold."

The concept that</i> Angptl4 <i>downregulation by cold exposure, specifically in BAT, is a key process in this pathway appears solid and does provide new information to the field.

The use of AICAR is equivocal, as other effects of AICAR have been shown to be mediated by pathways independent of AMPK and it is not a fully definitive reagent to use to solidify a conclusion about AMPK. While the data with AICAR are instructive and suggestive, the authors need to provide genetic or other evidence that AMPK is directly mediating the effect of cold exposure on ANGPTL4 expression.

One confounding factor is that the effects of AMPK on fuel use during cold are likely also mediated by factors other than ANGPTL4. Another confounding factor is that modulating AMPK in vivo is expected to alter plasma levels of FFA, which are very potent activators of ANGPTL4 production.
