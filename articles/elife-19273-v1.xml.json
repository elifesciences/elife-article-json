Here we observe that hIAPP fibrils are cytotoxic to cultured pancreatic \u03b2-cells, leading us to determine the structure and cytotoxicity of protein segments composing the amyloid spine of hIAPP. Using the cryoEM method MicroED, we discover that one segment, 19\u201329 S20G, forms pairs of \u03b2-sheets mated by a dry interface that share structural features with and are similarly cytotoxic to full-length hIAPP fibrils. In contrast, a second segment, 15\u201325 WT, forms non-toxic labile \u03b2-sheets. These segments possess different structures and cytotoxic effects, however, both can seed full-length hIAPP, and cause hIAPP to take on the cytotoxic and structural features of that segment. These results suggest that protein segment structures represent polymorphs of their parent protein and that segment 19\u201329 S20G may serve as a model for the toxic spine of hIAPP."

Here we observe that hIAPP fibrils are cytotoxic to cultured pancreatic \u03b2-cells, leading us to determine the structure and cytotoxicity of protein segments composing the amyloid spine of hIAPP. Using the cryoEM method MicroED, we discover that one segment, 19\u201329 S20G, forms pairs of \u03b2-sheets mated by a dry interface that share structural features with and are similarly cytotoxic to full-length hIAPP fibrils. In contrast, a second segment, 15\u201325 WT, forms non-toxic labile \u03b2-sheets. These segments possess different structures and cytotoxic effects, however, both can seed full-length hIAPP, and cause hIAPP to take on the cytotoxic and structural features of that segment. These results suggest that protein segment structures represent polymorphs of their parent protein and that segment 19\u201329 S20G may serve as a model for the toxic spine of hIAPP."

Another hormone, human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), works with insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. hIAPP is an amyloid protein, which means that it can lose its normal structure and form fibrils. Fibrils are difficult for cells to break down and are often associated with disease. Indeed, fibrils of hIAPP often form in the pancreas as part of Type-II Diabetes."

One segment, called 19-29 S20G, forms a standard amyloid fibril structure that is similar to the structure of full-length hIAPP fibrils. Adding these segments to human cells causes similar levels of toxicity as the full-length hIAPP fibrils.

The fibrils observed in each disease are composed of a particular protein; in T2D, amyloid fibrils are composed of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) (<a href=\"#bib100\">Westermark et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cooper et al., 1988</a>). hIAPP is a 37 residue polypeptide hormone that is co-secreted with insulin to modulate glucose levels (<a href=\"#bib80\">Roberts et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Westermark et al., 2011</a>)."

Approximately 90% of pancreatic tissue samples taken post-mortem from T2D patients contain islet amyloid primarily composed of hIAPP (<a href=\"#bib30\">H\u00f6ppener et al., 2000</a>). The extent of islet amyloid positively correlates with pancreatic \u03b2-cell loss and insulin dependence (<a href=\"#bib56\">Maloy et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Esapa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jurgens et al., 2011</a>). Additional support for a link comes from comparison of human and mouse IAPP: mouse IAPP differs from human IAPP by only six residues, 3 of which are \u03b2-strand breaking prolines. Consequently, mouse IAPP does not aggregate (<a href=\"#bib72\">Nishi et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Westermark et al., 1990</a>). Moreover, mice can be induced to develop islet amyloid and T2D when they are engineered to express human IAPP and fed a high fat diet (<a href=\"#bib95\">Verchere et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Westermark et al., 2000</a>). Perhaps the strongest support for a link is the mutation in hIAPP, hIAPP-S20G; segments that contain this mutation aggregate more quickly, contribute to increased pancreatic \u03b2-cell apoptosis, and are associated with early onset T2D in families who carry this lesion (<a href=\"#bib82\">Sakagashira et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Meier et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Sakagashira et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lee et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Morita et al., 2011</a>)."

Using mostly in vitro studies, researchers have presented evidence for toxicity of multiple types of hIAPP aggregates. Early studies suggest that amyloid fibrils are the primary cytotoxic species because preparations that contain fibrillar hIAPP were more cytotoxic than soluble preparations of the protein (<a href=\"#bib51\">Lorenzo et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lorenzo and Yankner, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Schubert et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kapurniotu, 2001</a>). Using cells and transgenic rodents as disease models, other studies found hIAPP fibrils to be associated with apoptosis, \u03b2-cell loss, and T2D severity (<a href=\"#bib73\">O'Brien et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hiddinga and Eberhardt, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Janson et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hull et al., 2005a</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Pilkington et al., 2016</a>). In contrast, some studies show that the process of hIAPP fibril formation, not the amyloid fibrils themselves, is the source of toxicity (<a href=\"#bib85\">Schlamadinger and Miranker, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Oskarsson et al., 2015</a>). However, most current research studies suggest soluble pre-fibrillar oligomers are the primary type of toxic aggregate. Support for oligomers as the primary cytotoxic species comes from the observation of oligomers associated with caspase activity and ER stress, which precede the formation of extracellular amyloid fibrils (<a href=\"#bib60\">Meier et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Ritzel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bram et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Mukherjee et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Haataja et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abedini et al., 2016</a>). Several recent studies show that hIAPP fibrils are relatively inert and do not exert obvious toxicity. Despite these extensive in vitro studies, it is not clear that the toxic aggregates they describe also elicit toxicity in vivo."

If fibrils are a bona fide type of toxic aggregate in vivo, then determining the atomic structure of the spine of hIAPP fibrils is a logical approach for advancing our understanding of disease-relevant targets\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib102\">Wiltzius et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib101\">2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Soriaga et al., 2016</a>). Furthermore, we can utilize atomic structures as templates for structure-based design of novel therapeutics that may protect against pancreatic \u03b2-cell death. Although full-length amyloid proteins have so far been resistant to crystallization, select protein segments that form the spines of amyloid fibrils do form crystals(<a href=\"#bib70\">Nelson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Sawaya et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Rodriguez et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, the atomic structures of nearly 90 amyloid spines have been revealed in this manner. Other studies have taken an alternative approach: they employed solid-state NMR to gain detailed structural insights into hIAPP fibril structure (<a href=\"#bib53\">Luca et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Weirich et al., 2016</a>); some of these structures have spurred successful inhibitor designs (<a href=\"#bib62\">Mirecka et al., 2016</a>). Here, we use the cryoEM method MicroED to determine the atomic structure of two 11-residue segments, termed spine segments, that span the amyloid spine of hIAPP."

First, the sequence of mouse IAPP (mIAPP), which is non-amyloidogenic, differs from human IAPP only within this region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Second, the only known familial disease mutation in hIAPP, hIAPP-S20G, also occurs within this region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib82\">Sakagashira et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cao et al., 2012</a>). Third, previous work by our laboratory has shown that Phe15 may be part of the amyloid spine because it is required for stabilizing an on-pathway \u03b1-helical dimer and mutating this residue can delay fibril formation (<a href=\"#bib103\">Wiltzius et al., 2009b</a>)."

MicroED employs a standard cryo electron microscope (cryoEM) in diffraction mode for data collection from 3D crystals only a few hundred nanometers thick (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib89\">Shi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Nannenga et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib69\">2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hattne et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Liu et al., 2016</a>). Such thin crystals are capable of producing measurable Bragg peaks because electrons interact with matter more strongly than X-rays. Indeed, we found that the nano-sized 3D crystals used for MicroED produced higher resolution diffraction than relatively larger crystals suited for structure determination at a microfocus X-ray beamline (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Evidently, micron-thick needle crystals are sufficient for X-ray structure determination with six or seven residue peptides, but not for 11-residue peptides. These experiences closely mirrored those in the determination of the atomic structure of the toxic core of \u03b1-synuclein (<a href=\"#bib81\">Rodriguez et al., 2015</a>), an 11-residue segment that forms the spine of amyloid fibrils associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease."

Radial profiles calculated from X-ray fiber diffraction of 19\u201329 WT and 19\u201329 S20G fibrils show strong reflections in common at 4.6 \u00c5, 8.4 \u00c5 and 8.7 \u00c5, and 34.7 \u00c5, indicative of interstrand, intersheet, and proto-filament spacing, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). A previous study of 20\u201329 WT fiber diffraction revealed comparable reflections, which the authors used to formulate a fibril model of 20\u201329 WT that roughly agrees with our 19\u201329 S20G atomic structure (<a href=\"#bib54\">Madine et al., 2008</a>). Our atomic structure and their model differ by a small shift in registration between sheets, allowing for tighter packing in the atomic structure. These results are consistent with earlier findings by Cao and co-workers, who observed that hIAPP-WT fibrils seed hIAPP-S20G fibril formation, thus suggesting a shared fibrillar structure (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cao et al., 2012</a>)."

The stability of the mutant segment may stem from the early onset Gly20 mutation, which adopts an unusual geometry (\u03c6\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212101.7\u00b0 and \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a0107.5\u00b0) that creates a kink in the peptide backbone. To investigate this hypothesis, we generated a model of 19\u201329 WT consisting of a mated pair of ten-stranded sheets. The model was identical to the 19\u201329 S20G atomic structure with the exception that we adjusted the backbone torsion angles of Ser20 to comply with the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot for a non-glycine residue. We compared the energies of the WT and S20G structures after minimization with FoldIt (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cooper et al., 2010</a>). The dry interfaces are nearly identical between the two segments, except near Asn21, where the altered backbone torsion angles break the canonical Asn ladder hydrogen bonding interactions with neighboring Asn21 residues within the sheet and instead, form hydrogen bonds with Ser29 from the opposing sheet. The alteration separates the pair of sheets by approximately 1.5 \u00c5 in this region, and therefore the 19\u201329 S20G structure has a slightly lower energy than 19\u201329 WT (\u2212590 REU vs. \u2212535 REU)."

Deviation of strands from the fibril perpendicular is a natural consequence of the registration shift implied by out-of-register structures. The out-of-register \u03b2-strands are stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding. Within each sheet, the \u03b2-strands form two distinct, unequal interfaces: a stronger interface with twelve hydrogen bonds, and a weaker interface with eight hydrogen bonds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This inequality between interfaces has been observed in previous examples of out-of-register sheets (<a href=\"#bib91\">Soriaga et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Laganowsky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Yu et al., 2015</a>). A view down the \u2018proto-fibril axis\u2019 of the crystal shows that the faces of adjacent sheets are wet and overlap only partially (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>); the asymmetric unit contains density for seven ordered water molecules and one thiocyanate molecule. The area buried between adjacent sheets is small (10.7 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> per residue) compared to the average steric-zipper (20.1 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> per residue). Hence, there is no dry interface between adjacent sheets in the crystal, and the structure seems labile compared to that of 19\u201329 S20G."

We discovered that segment 19\u201329 S20G forms a pair of \u03b2-sheets mated at a dry interface, a structure that shares key features with full-length hIAPP fibrils as described in the following paragraph. What\u2019s more, the fibrillar form of 19\u201329 S20G is cytotoxic. In contrast, segment 15\u201325 WT forms an unusual arrangement of single, out-of-register \u03b2-sheets that are not cytotoxic. The divergence in structure and cytotoxicity of segments 19\u201329 S20G and 15\u201325 WT suggests that strong, stable intermolecular interactions are important features of cytotoxic amyloid proteins."

First, preparations of 19\u201329 S20G that contain fibrils are cytotoxic, as is the case for full-length hIAPP. Second, X-ray fiber diffraction calculated from the dry interface of the 19\u201329 S20G atomic structure shares key features with fiber diffraction collected from full-length hIAPP fibrils. Third, segment 19\u201329 S20G elicits cytotoxicity by altering cell metabolism and activating pro-apoptotic machinery, mechanisms by which full-length hIAPP fibrils are thought to contribute to pancreatic \u03b2-cell death during T2D. Fourth, the early onset S20G mutation confers greater cytotoxicity within segment 19\u201329 and within full-length hIAPP. Last, EGCG, a flavanol that mitigates full-length hIAPP fibril formation and cytotoxicity, likewise mitigates 19\u201329 S20G fibril formation and cytotoxicity. These results, taken together with the canonical pathogenic amyloid fibril architecture of segment 19\u201329 S20G, suggest it represents the toxic amyloid spine of hIAPP."

These multiple diverse structures suggest there is significant polymorphism within the hIAPP amyloid spine, but exactly which of these polymorphs elicit cytotoxicity was not known. By studying the structures and cytotoxic effects of protein segments in parallel, we identify a cytotoxic hIAPP fibril structure that may contribute to pancreatic \u03b2-cell death during T2D.

In the dry interface of the 19\u201329 S20G atomic structure, the curved \u03b2-sheets accommodate the tightly packed hydrophobic core, which includes a bulky phenylalanine, while maintaining high shape complementarity and large buried surface area. Paradoxically, in the 15\u201325 WT atomic structure, the curved \u03b2-sheets appear to have an opposite effect: the curved \u03b2-sheets appear to prevent adjacent sheets from associating to form a canonical pathogenic amyloid fibril architecture. In both atomic structures, the effect of the curved \u03b2-sheets is dictated by the registry of adjacent \u03b2-sheets (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

Here, we show that 15\u201325 WT is not cytotoxic but in contrast, the out-of-register protein segment KDWSFY from \u03b22-microglobulin elicits mild cytotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib47\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). One notable difference between the two structures is that the 15\u201325 WT structure is formed of single sheets, while the KDWSFY structure is formed of sheets mated by a dry interface. The dry interface of the KDWSFY atomic structure results in a higher solvation energy per strand compared to the 15\u201325 WT atomic structure (122 cal/mol/strand vs. 19 cal/mol/strand). Given that cytotoxic structures like 19\u201329 S20G have relatively high solvation energies per strand (279 cal/mol/strand; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), this difference may explain the disparate cytotoxic effects of the two out-of-register structures. However, we need more studies of out-of-register protein structures and their cognate cytotoxic effects to definitively make this conclusion. The disparate cytotoxic effects within this structure class lead us to believe that the nature of cytotoxicity is not simply conferred by in-register or out-of-register structures. As many studies have suggested, there may be more than one mechanism of amyloid-related toxicity and the different mechanisms may be catalyzed by different architectures. Alternatively, maybe if additional residues were included, the anti-parallel out-of-register fiber could be stabilized, thereby increasing its toxicity."

For this assay, Rin5F cells were plated as previously described in white-walled 96-well plates (Cat. # 3917, Costar, Tewksbury, MA). After the designated aging period of each hIAPP preparation, 10 \u03bcL of sample was added to cells and thus diluted 1/10 from in vitro stocks. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Samples were incubated with cells for 24 h. Next, cell culture media, caspase-3/7 reagent, and the cells were brought to room temperature. All media was aspirated from wells and then replaced with 25 \u03bcL of media and 25 \u03bcL of caspase-3/7 reagent and mixed thoroughly. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then luminescence was measured using a SpectraMax M5. Experimental points were normalized to vehicle-treated cells, which were designated as 100%. Cells treated with 2 \u03bcM staurosporine were used as a positive control to ensure the assay kit worked correctly."

The samples were homogenized with vortexing, and then aliquoted to 0.5 mL tubes with equal volumes. Each fibril sample was treated with water or increasing amounts of SDS, and then heated at 55\u00b0C for 20 min. Next, an aliquot of each sample was transferred to a 384-well plate and turbidity was measured by recording absorbance at 340 nm. Each fibril sample was spotted onto a grid for negative-stain EM to analyze fibril abundance. The experiment was repeated twice, but the results of 1 experiment are shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>."

The work is technically excellent, the use of Cryo electron microscopy-based MicroED is highly suitable for the scientific quest and the addition of the biological data is very important. The main conclusion is that the fibrillar form of hIAPP segment 19-29S20G is toxic, but its oligomeric form is not. In addition, in- or out-of registration/hydrophobicity of the four IAPP segments of interest in fibrillation is insufficient to account for the observed differential toxicity. This study concludes that 19-29S20G could be used as a model system for examining hIAPP aggregation and toxicity. The work is elegant and it provides important insights on the cytotoxicity of the polypeptide that is associated with Type II diabetes. The conclusions are consistent with the experimental results and the Discussion is very good. On the other hand, it is somewhat surprising that this manuscript heavily emphasizes on cytotoxicity \u2013 a not so very original point of this study, while the more novel structural observations are only mentioned in passing.

Since toxicity is the biological endpoint of a chemical (e.g., ROS), physical (amyloids, oligomers and their associated hydrophobicity/membrane partitioning, assembly kinetics, assembly with intra- and extracellular proteins) or biological (the triangle between insulin, amylin and glucose etc.) trigger, it seems to make more sense that it is the combined contributions of these aspects, different for hIAPP fibrils and oligomers in each aspect, induce the toxicity of hIAPP."

We do not, however, get into the mechanism of hIAPP action on cells; we restrict ourselves to reporting our observations of toxicity without proposing a mechanism. Our private hypothesis is that the mechanism may involve both mature fibrils and smaller species, perhaps short fibrils. That is, amyloid fibril deposition leads to distortion of the histological structure of the affected organ. Islet hormone release is dependent on the islet architecture and regulated insulin release requires cell-cell interaction via connexin-36. When hIAPP amyloid deposits extracellularly it results in separation of the \u03b2 cells and loss of synchronized hormone release. Islet amyloid occurs perivascular and sometimes prominent deposits occur, possibly influencing diffusion of oxygen and nutrients. Whereas mature amyloid fibrils may exert no direct \u03b2 cell cytotoxicity, amyloid fibrils somehow affect islet function, and the results of our paper may contribute to the ultimate understanding of the mechanism."

Given that cytotoxic structures like 19-29 S20G have high solvation energies per strand (279 cal/mol/strand; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), this difference may explain the disparate cytotoxic effects of the two out-of-register structures.

Taken together with the 15 crystal structures of hIAPP protein segments, we surmise that there is some flexibility of side- chain interactions in the fibril."
