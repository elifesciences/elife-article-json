                    "text": "The climbing fiber input to Purkinje cells acts as a teaching signal by triggering a massive influx of dendritic calcium that marks the occurrence of instructive stimuli during cerebellar learning. Here, we challenge the view that these calcium spikes are all-or-none and only signal whether the instructive stimulus has occurred, without providing parametric information about its features. We imaged ensembles of Purkinje cell dendrites in awake mice and measured their calcium responses to periocular airpuffs that serve as instructive stimuli during cerebellar-dependent eyeblink conditioning. Information about airpuff duration and pressure was encoded probabilistically across repeated trials, and in two additional signals in single trials: the synchrony of calcium spikes in the Purkinje cell population, and the amplitude of the calcium spikes, which was modulated by a non-climbing fiber pathway. These results indicate that calcium-based teaching signals in Purkinje cells contain analog information that encodes the strength of instructive stimuli trial-by-trial."

Here, we challenge the view that these calcium spikes are all-or-none and only signal whether the instructive stimulus has occurred, without providing parametric information about its features. We imaged ensembles of Purkinje cell dendrites in awake mice and measured their calcium responses to periocular airpuffs that serve as instructive stimuli during cerebellar-dependent eyeblink conditioning. Information about airpuff duration and pressure was encoded probabilistically across repeated trials, and in two additional signals in single trials: the synchrony of calcium spikes in the Purkinje cell population, and the amplitude of the calcium spikes, which was modulated by a non-climbing fiber pathway. These results indicate that calcium-based teaching signals in Purkinje cells contain analog information that encodes the strength of instructive stimuli trial-by-trial."

For example, if you know that a puff of air is going to be directed at your eye, it's a good idea to close it in advance. However, how much you need to close it depends on how strong that puff of air is. A very strong puff might require closing the eye completely to protect it. In contrast, it is probably better to only partially close the eye if you know a lighter puff of air is coming, so that you can still see."

However, climbing fibers were thought to be able to respond in only two ways: either they fire in a single burst to signal that an event has occurred, or they don't fire. It was therefore unclear how the finer details of the event (for example, the strength of the puff of air) are transmitted to the cerebellum."

Support for this hypothesis comes from studies of Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning (<a href=\"#bib52\">Medina et al., 2000</a>), a simple associative task in which subjects learn to blink to an initially neutral cue if it is repeatedly paired with a blink-eliciting instructive stimulus, such as a periocular airpuff. Previous work has shown that some CFs fire a burst of spikes when the unexpected periocular airpuff is delivered (<a href=\"#bib75\">Sears and Steinmetz, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nicholson and Freeman, 2003</a>), and that this signal is sufficient for conditioning (<a href=\"#bib51\">Mauk et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Thompson et al., 1998</a>). All of these studies indicate that CFs are an important source of instructive signals to the cerebellum. However, we do not understand how CF signals encode even the most basic stimulus features such as the strength of the periocular airpuff, which has a major impact on the magnitude and the rate of learning (<a href=\"#bib78\">Spence, 1953</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Smith, 1968</a>)."

CFs fire bursts spontaneously at \u223c1 Hz (<a href=\"#bib83\">Thach, 1968</a>), a low rate that is barely modulated during sensory stimulation (<a href=\"#bib76\">Simpson et al., 1996</a>).

Another peculiarity is that in the adult cerebellum, each PC is innervated by only one CF (<a href=\"#bib76\">Simpson et al., 1996</a>). The CF-PC synapse is one of the most powerful and reliable in the brain (<a href=\"#bib71\">Schmolesky et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Ohtsuki et al., 2009</a>): each time the CF fires a burst, it evokes in PCs both a burst of sodium spikes in the soma known as a complex spike (<a href=\"#bib17\">Eccles et al., 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Thach, 1968</a>), and a massive calcium-based spike in the dendrite (<a href=\"#bib45\">Llin\u00e1s and Sugimori, 1980</a>)."

Others have pointed out that sensory events synchronize CFs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Llin\u00e1s and Sasaki, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lou and Bloedel, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Wylie et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ozden et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schultz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Wise et al., 2010</a>), which raises the possibility that stimulus information may be available in the precise timing of CF inputs (<a href=\"#bib74\">Schweighofer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Van Der Giessen et al., 2008</a>), or in the level of co-activation in the CF population (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ghosh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Tokuda et al., 2013</a>).

Because each PC receives input from a single CF (<a href=\"#bib76\">Simpson et al., 1996</a>), we were able to discriminate the post-synaptic calcium events corresponding to individual pre-synaptic CF bursts and analyze their amplitude, timing and probability. Two-photon imaging also allowed us to analyze ensembles of PC dendrites whose CF inputs were co-activated by the periocular airpuff. Thus our experiments provide a unique opportunity to evaluate a variety of calcium-based codes in PCs, both at the individual dendrite and population levels."

Second, they had a fast rise (\u223c10 ms <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), as observed for CF-triggered signals in other calcium imaging studies (<a href=\"#bib55\">Miyakawa et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Eilers et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Schmidt et al., 2003</a>), and a slower decay t<sub>1/2</sub> of 74 \u00b1 13 ms (mean \u00b1 SD), which is in the midrange of previously observed kinetics using synthetic indicators (decay t<sub>1/2</sub> = 25\u2013170 ms; [<a href=\"#bib79\">Sullivan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sarkisov and Wang, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ozden et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kitamura and H\u00e4usser, 2011</a>]).

To assess this possibility, we measured the joint probability for every pair of dendrites in each one of our experiments, that is the probability of observing a CF-triggered calcium event in both dendrites within the same 150 ms time window, and compared it to the joint probability expected for independent dendrites (P<sub>ij</sub> = P<sub>i</sub> \u00d7 P<sub>j</sub>, where P<sub>i</sub> and P<sub>j</sub> represent the calcium-event probability of dendrites i and j in that same time window). We found that joint probability deviated significantly from the independence assumption for all airpuff strengths (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; two sample <i>t</i> test, p &lt; 0.001). We call this deviation \u2018extra synchrony\u2019 because it represents the synchrony beyond that expected solely from the calcium-event probability of two independent dendrites. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> shows that there was a gradual boost in the amount of extra synchrony as the airpuff duration or pressure was increased (Duration data: two-way ANOVA: F[4361] = 113.49, p &lt; 0.0001; Tukey's HSD: p &lt; 0.0001, except for d3\u2013d4 comparison.

In other words, the degree to which CFs are dependent on each other scales up smoothly with their overall response probability. These results suggest that CF co-activation may be controlled upstream, perhaps in the inferior olive, in a way that provides information about stimulus strength at the level of the PC population."

Dendritic calcium is responsible for triggering a variety of mechanisms of cellular plasticity that cause short- and long-term modifications in the strength of PC synapses (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gao et al., 2012</a>). These plasticity mechanisms are tightly regulated and can be differentially engaged depending on the precise amplitude and duration of the calcium signal in the PC dendrite. For example, small differences in dendritic calcium can influence how much PF synapses will change in vitro (<a href=\"#bib6\">Coesmans et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Tanaka et al., 2007</a>), and can also determine the direction of learning-related changes in the firing of PCs recorded in vivo during eyeblink conditioning (<a href=\"#bib67\">Rasmussen et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we predict that the amount and direction of plasticity induced in a PC during cerebellar learning will vary trial-by-trial depending on the dendritic calcium response triggered by each presentation of the instructive stimulus. This type of trial-by-trial regulation of CF-related instructive signals has been recently demonstrated in monkeys learning a cerebellar-dependent eye movement task (<a href=\"#bib91\">Yang and Lisberger, 2014</a>)."

Our results confirm and extend these findings in two ways: First, we demonstrated that the level of synchronization is regulated by the strength of the stimulus, that is a larger fraction of the local CF population was activated after strong periocular airpuffs than after weak airpuffs. Second, we found that stimulus-related differences in the level of synchronization are partly driven by a mechanism that boosts synchrony beyond what is expected for independent CFs. We do not know the source of this extra synchrony or the mechanisms that modulate it during sensory stimulation. However, we note that electrical coupling of cells in the inferior olive (IO) plays an important role in synchronizing CF activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">De Zeeuw et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blenkinsop and Lang, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Van Der Giessen et al., 2008</a>), and that the coupling coefficient can be dynamically modulated up and down via stimulus-related activation of synaptic inputs to the IO (<a href=\"#bib44\">Llin\u00e1s and Sasaki, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lang, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lefler et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">De Gruijl et al., 2014b</a>)."

For example, sensory events that activate many CFs simultaneously may be particularly effective for triggering NMDA-dependent plasticity in molecular layer interneurons of the cerebellar cortex (<a href=\"#bib15\">Duguid and Smart, 2004</a>), via synchronized spillover of glutamate from multiple CF release sites (<a href=\"#bib80\">Szapiro and Barbour, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Mathews et al., 2012</a>). Another possibility is that CF synchrony could be used to set the strength of the plasticity signals sent by inhibitory PCs to downstream cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN; <a href=\"#bib61\">Otis et al., 2012</a>), which are the final output of the cerebellum. This hypothesis is consistent with recent work showing that DCN cells exhibit rebound firing immediately after being released from the hyperpolarization caused by CF-driven synchronization of the PC population (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hoebeek et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bengtsson et al., 2011</a>), and that this rebound can serve as a trigger for plasticity (<a href=\"#bib66\">Pugh and Raman, 2006</a>). Release from hyperpolarization may also be sufficient to trigger calcium-based excitable events in dendrites of the DCN (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schneider et al., 2013</a>), an effect that may be enhanced by direct monosynaptic excitation of DCN neurons by CF collaterals firing at the same time (<a href=\"#bib43\">Llin\u00e1s and Muhlethaler, 1988</a>)."

In our experiments, a higher level of CF synchrony after a strong periocular airpuff might serve to enhance the reflex response by generating a faster or longer duration eyeblink movement (<a href=\"#bib22\">Evinger et al., 1991</a>)."

To be useful, CFs must do more than alert about the occurrence of an unexpected event such as the presentation of a periocular airpuff in the early stages of eyeblink conditioning (<a href=\"#bib75\">Sears and Steinmetz, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nicholson and Freeman, 2003</a>); they must also provide analog information to indicate how unexpected the event was, that is, how much stronger or weaker the airpuff was compared with expectations. Our experiments demonstrate that CFs and non-CF pathways together encode information about stimulus strength in PC dendrites when the presentation of the stimulus cannot be predicted. It will be important to understand whether and how the different calcium-based codes we have uncovered may be modulated during cerebellar learning, as the stimulus becomes predictable."

A small area of the cerebellum was exposed (diameter: 3 mm), and a Kwik-Sil plug, pre-molded on a coverslip, was secured over the dura using a two-piece, stainless steel headplate. Throughout the surgery, sterile saline was used to keep the dura wet. Animals\u2019 body temperature was monitored and maintained near 37\u00b0C.

Calcium events with a peak in the interval 50\u2013200 ms after the periocular stimulus were considered airpuff-evoked. The onset latency of calcium events (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) was computed manually by inspecting each airpuff-evoked calcium event. Coactivation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) was computed for each trial separately by dividing the number of dendrites with an airpuff-evoked calcium event, by the total number of responsive dendrites in the field of view. The measured joint probability for a pair of dendrites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) was calculated as the fraction of trials in which both dendrites in the pair exhibited airpuff-evoked calcium events. The independent joint probability was computed by multiplying the calcium-event probability of the two dendrites (P<sub>ij</sub> = P<sub>i</sub> \u00d7 P<sub>j</sub>). The d1\u2013d4 traces in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> were computed by averaging the normalized \u0394F/F signals of all the individual dendrites in trials with a calcium event. To provide a fair comparison, the \u2018sp\u2019 trace was computed the same way, after substituting the \u0394F/F signal of all the stimulus-evoked calcium events in a given dendrite with the normalized \u0394F/F signal corresponding to the average spontaneous calcium event for that dendrite. Thus, the temporal jitter in the onset latency of the individual calcium events comprising the \u2018sp\u2019 trace was the same as in the d1\u2013d4 conditions. The size of individual calcium events (\u0394F/F-integral, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) was computed by taking the integral of the normalized \u0394F/F signal over the interval [t t + 100 ms], where t is the time point at which the peak of the event occurs. The non-CF signal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>) was analyzed in trials without any calcium events within 50\u2013200 ms of the airpuff stimulus. The size of the non-CF signal was measured in a similar way as the calcium events, by taking the integral of the normalized \u0394F/F signal over the interval [t t + 100 ms], where t is a time point selected randomly within 50\u2013200 ms of the stimulus.

Given the central role of climbing fibers in cerebellar physiology this is a significant topic of study. The authors are the first to quantify in awake mice how a population of climbing fibers represents a sensory stimulus known to drive learning. They find that these stimuli are represented at a population level in a modular fashion and uncover some tantalizing evidence that the individual climbing fiber inputs to single Purkinje neurons are graded. This latter finding is novel and complements some recent high profile work showing that graded signals represent a population-wide signal relevant to learning (<a href=\"#bib91\">Yang &amp; Lisberger, 2014</a>)."

We base this prediction on two known features of the parallel fiber input: (1) parallel fibers and climbing fibers activated by the same stimulus often converge on the same Purkinje cell, and (2) direct stimulation of parallel fibers causes a graded calcium response in the Purkinje cell dendrites that has similar kinetics to the non-climbing fiber signal in our experiments.

This difference would not be captured by the 100-ms time window we selected for our analyses. We now point this out in the text. Second, supralinearity is by its nature amplification, i.e. what may look like a small change in a particular signal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, d3 vs d4) is translated into a much bigger change (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, d3 vs d4). The difference between 6D and 6B could arise from voltage summation entering a regenerative regime, including a difference in spatial spread. We think there is not an inconsistency; but we agree that there is more to study about this in the future."

                    "text": "Another possibility is that the supra-linearity for d4 is partially driven by mechanisms unrelated to the non-CF response. For example, d3 and d4 could both evoke non-CF signals below threshold for supra-linearity, but d4 could generate climbing fiber responses with a higher number of spikes in a larger fraction of the trials. We have modified the text to address this point and include this possibility."

This is a wise choice and it is well documented why the learning context is indeed probably highly relevant. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the current findings are also relevant for short-term effects on motor behavior, e.g. reactions following perturbations (see e.g. CS calcium imaging study of WT and Cx36-/- by De Gruijl et al., 2014 in J Neuroscience). The latter study in fact also shows the mechanisms through microzones (rather than zones). Please consider discussing this issue next to the long-term effects</i>."
