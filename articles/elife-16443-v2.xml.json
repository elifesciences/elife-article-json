Comparison of the neuronal activity in BG input and downstream structures reveals that subthalamic, not striatal, activity fluctuations correlate with modulations in the increase/decrease discharge balance of BG downstream neurons during temporal discounting classical condition task. After induction of parkinsonism with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), abnormal low beta (8-15 Hz) spiking and local field potential (LFP) oscillations resonate across the BG network. Nevertheless, LFP beta oscillations entrain spiking activity of STN, striatal cholinergic interneurons and BG downstream structures, but do not entrain spiking activity of striatal projection neurons. Our results highlight the pivotal role of STN divergent projections in BG physiology and pathophysiology and may explain why STN is such an effective site for invasive treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease and other BG-related disorders."

Comparison of the neuronal activity in BG input and downstream structures reveals that subthalamic, not striatal, activity fluctuations correlate with modulations in the increase/decrease discharge balance of BG downstream neurons during temporal discounting classical condition task. After induction of parkinsonism with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), abnormal low beta (8-15 Hz) spiking and local field potential (LFP) oscillations resonate across the BG network. Nevertheless, LFP beta oscillations entrain spiking activity of STN, striatal cholinergic interneurons and BG downstream structures, but do not entrain spiking activity of striatal projection neurons. Our results highlight the pivotal role of STN divergent projections in BG physiology and pathophysiology and may explain why STN is such an effective site for invasive treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease and other BG-related disorders."

Before the injections, spontaneous fluctuations in the activity of the subthalamic nucleus produced matching changes in the activity of the three downstream basal ganglia structures. Fluctuations in the activity of the striatum, by contrast, had no such effect. Moreover, injecting the monkeys with MPTP caused the basal ganglia to fire in an abnormal highly synchronized rhythm, similar to that seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Crucially, the subthalamic nucleus contributed to this abnormal rhythm, whereas the striatum did not."

First, the main axis (or 'actor' in machine learning terminology) which corresponds to the BG structures that connect state-encoding thalamo-cortical areas to cortical and brainstem motor centers. Second, the neuromodulators (machine learning's 'critics', e.g., the midbrain dopaminergic neurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons) that adjust activity along the BG main axis by encoding a prediction error signal capable of modulating the efficacy of cortico-striatal transmission (<a href=\"#bib31\">Deffains and Bergman, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Reynolds et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Shen et al., 2008</a>)."

In return, the GPe emits feedback GABAergic projections to the STN (<a href=\"#bib25\">Carpenter et al., 1981</a>) and the striatum (<a href=\"#bib52\">Hegeman et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Mallet et al., 2012</a>) as well as massive feedforward GABAergic projections to the GPi/SNr (<a href=\"#bib88\">Parent and Hazrati, 1995b</a>). Thus, aside from the action of the BG neuromodulators and lateral connectivity, the increase-decrease balance of spiking activity (I/D balance) of pallidal and nigral neurons is fined-tuned by the inhibitory and excitatory drives exerted by the striatum and STN, respectively. However, how these antagonistic drives operate to convey relevant information from the state-encoding thalamo-cortical areas through the central (GPe) and output (GPi and SNr) BG structures to brain motor centers is still unknown."

In addition, the striatum is much larger than the STN (10<sup>7</sup> vs. 10<sup>5</sup> neurons in non-human primates, respectively, <a href=\"#bib50\">Hardman et al., 2002</a>). Nevertheless, the STN, not the striatum, is the prime target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of human patients with advanced PD (<a href=\"#bib66\">Limousin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Odekerken et al., 2016</a>). Moreover, it has been shown that STN-DBS abolishes abnormal synchronized oscillations in the BG network of animal models of PD (<a href=\"#bib71\">Meissner et al., 2005</a>) and human PD patients (<a href=\"#bib60\">K\u00fchn et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Wingeier et al., 2006</a>).

These multi-site recordings in both the normal and parkinsonian states served us to reveal how BG activity propagates along the BG main axis in health and parkinsonism.

The striatum is composed of the posterior putamen (motor area), the caudate nucleus (associative area) and ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (limbic area) (<a href=\"#bib87\">Parent and Hazrati, 1995a</a>). In this study, striatal (MSN and TAN) spiking activity was preferentially collected within the posterior putamen. The remaining striatal recordings were made in the caudate nucleus. As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adler et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Graybiel et al., 1994</a>), we did not find significant differences in the activity of MSNs and TANs between these two striatal sub-regions (data not shown).

HFD neurons of the GPe, GPi and SNr comprise &gt;85% of the neurons in these structures and, like striatal MSNs and STN neurons, are probably the projection neurons of these structures. Thus, a unique, and very advantageous for the current study, feature of the BG network is that each BG nucleus forms a single layer network; in other words, the BG projection neurons are innervated by the projections of the upward structures. Namely, the activity of striatal and STN projection neurons directly affects the activity of the recorded GPe, GPi and SNr projection neurons. We used this property to infer the relative influence of the BG input structures (striatum and STN) on the activity of the central (GPe) and output (GPi and SNr) structures of the BG network."

In both conditions (immediate and delayed) of the behavioral task, the frequency of the licking and blinking movements increased in response to food and airpuff delivery, respectively. Remarkably, the animals responded with appropriate anticipatory licking and blinking behavior to the outcome delivery in the immediate condition. In contrast, in the delayed condition, the animals did not display any robust anticipatory licking and blinking movements during the cue and delay periods. Together, these behavioral results indicate that the animals learned the cue values (appetitive, aversive or neutral) and differentiated between cues predicting an immediate or a delayed outcome. However, the introduction of a 6-s delay period after cue offset probably compromised the temporal predictability of the outcome delivery in the delayed condition."

The mean relative PSTH is calculated as the arithmetic average of the single neurons' PSTHs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and is more standard in neuroscience. The mean relative PSTH reflects the common assumption that the on-going activity of the studied population is close to zero and that the studied neurons excite their neuronal targets that act as integrate-and-fire neurons (<a href=\"#bib53\">Izhikevich, 2007</a>). On the other hand, most BG neurons fire at tonic high frequencies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C and D</a>) and a large fraction of their responses to behavioral events consists of decreases in discharge rate (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adler et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Espinosa-Parrilla et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Joshua et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Turner and Anderson, 2005</a>). Thus, neurons of the BG network might follow resonance rather than integrate-and-fire rules when they are activated by their afferents (<a href=\"#bib53\">Izhikevich, 2007</a>). We therefore calculated the mean absolute PSTH (absolute deviation from the baseline of the firing rate, see Materials and methods) of the BG neurons recorded in our study. These absolute PSTHs revealed that the average population response to the cue of each neuronal assembly of the BG main axis persisted until the outcome delivery in both conditions (immediate and delayed) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, green lines). Therefore, these persistent modulations of activity along the BG main axis temporally bridged sensory visual information (provided by cue presentation) and the actions (licking and blinking movements) wired to outcome delivery and continued even when the visual information was no longer available during the 6-s delay period in the delayed condition. The persistent responses in the BG main axis contrast with the transient response of the TANs (i.e., one of the BG neuromodulators) to the cue onset (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."

However, using extracellular recording method, we can only record changes in the discharge rate of neurons but not the corresponding changes in synaptic and membrane potentials. Since both an increase in excitation and an abolition of inhibition can lead to an increase in discharge rate (and vice versa for decreases in discharge rate), we used the more conservative nomenclature of the increase/decrease discharge rate balance (I/D balance)."

This was done for each neuronal assembly, from cue onset to outcome delivery, in the two behavioral conditions (immediate and delayed). This way, we examined the I/D balance (i.e., relative increase vs. decrease dominance of activity as measured by the fraction weighted by the magnitude) over time along the BG main axis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, left and central histograms). We found that during the cue periods in both conditions, increases in activity (positive I/D balance) strongly predominated in all BG structures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, right bar plots). In contrast, during the delay period, although the I/D balance was still strikingly biased towards increases in activity for the MSNs, this imbalance was significantly reduced in the STN and reversed in the GPe, GPi and SNr (one-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.001, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, right bar plots). Thus, whereas the inhibitory GABAergic drive from the striatum was unchanged over the different task periods, the STN excitatory glutamatergic drive was reduced when moving from the cue to the delay periods. This reduced STN excitatory drive was concurrent with a reduction in the activity in the BG downstream structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>) and with the animals' modified behavioral policy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Nevertheless, this significant BG input effect varied depending on the polarity of the neuronal response of the BG input neurons that composed the BG input-downstream pairs.

In addition, it has been reported that multi-unit cross-correlations might be a more sensitive detector of neuronal relationships than single-unit cross-correlations (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bedenbaugh and Gerstein, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Gerstein, 2000</a>). Indeed, most intra-operative human physiological studies during DBS procedures are conducted at the level of multi-unit activity (MUA). For these reasons and given the very low firing rate of the MSNs, we investigated multi-unit oscillatory activity recorded in the vicinity of the recorded BG cells rather than single-unit oscillatory activity (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Using the MUA recording in the vicinity of a well-isolated single unit better guarantees the location of the recording and rules out shifts in electrode position during the recording."

Therefore, one might suggest that MSN spike-striatal field coherence (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a>) could materialize only when the striatal LFP (recorded in the vicinity of the MSNs) oscillated. In other words, the current average analysis might not reflect a small population of MSNs that synchronized their activity with the robust 8\u201315\u2009Hz oscillatory LFPs. To test this hypothesis, we correlated the strength of the LFP oscillations and the degree of spike-field coherence in the striatum (and elsewhere) of the parkinsonian monkeys. We found that regardless of the BG neuronal component (i.e., including striatal MSNs) the degree of synchronization between the single-unit (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15</a>) or multi-unit (<a href=\"#fig15s1\">Figure 15\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) spiking activity and the LFP oscillations was not (linearly) related to the strength of the 8\u201315\u2009Hz LFP oscillations.

Namely, TAN, STN, GPe and SNr neurons tended to fire around the negative peak of the 8\u201315\u2009Hz oscillatory LFP - but see <a href=\"#bib80\">Nelson and Pouget (2010)</a> for possible confounding effects of electrode and instrument filter properties on the exact phase relationships between spikes and LFPs. We verified the results obtained with the coherence/phase analysis by examining the population spike-triggered averages of the LFP (STAs LFP). The STA LFP analysis revealed that except for MSNs, the coincidence between the spikes of the STN, GPe, SNr neurons, as well as those of the TANs, and the negative waves of the LFP oscillations increased after MPTP intoxication (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16</a>, left and central columns). Finally, to rule out the possibility that differences in the population STAs LFP were not a mere consequence of the differences in discharge rate (and the total number of triggers) of the different BG neuronal components (<a href=\"#fig17\">Figure 17</a>), we also calculated the STAs LFP after random dilution of the spike trains of the neurons (see Materials and methods). We found that the random dilution of the spike trains did not affect the STA-LFP results (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16</a>, right column). Therefore, in the parkinsonian state, spike-LFP synchronization was not influenced by the firing rate of BG neuronal components and more importantly, the absence of phase locking between MSN spiking activity and striatal LFPs was probably not due to the confounding effects of the slow discharge rate of the MSNs."

Therefore, it is crucial to show that persistent modulatory activity (i.e., during prolonged delays between sensory perception and action, especially when sensory information is no longer available) is not a unique property of the frontal cortex and other cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib30\">Curtis and Lee, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Durstewitz et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</a>), but can also be found along the BG main axis."

Due to their low baseline firing rate (<a href=\"#fig17\">Figure 17A</a>), it might be posited that like other low-discharge rate neurons (e.g., in the cortex), the neuronal responses of the striatal MSNs would be restricted to increases in activity.

Our experimental methods (i.e., extracellular recording of spiking activity in behaving animals) did not allow us to differentiate between the activity of MSNs of the BG direct (D1 MSNs-GPi/SNr) and indirect (D2 MSNs-GPe-STN-GPi/SNr) pathways (<a href=\"#bib4\">Albin et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Gerfen et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

In addition, a formal clustering analysis of the MSN responses from cue onset to outcome delivery in both conditions (data not shown) found no evidence for two distinct MSN sub-groups (e.g., one group that responded during cue presentation and another group that responded during the extended delay period) that could account for the reversal of I/D balance in the BG downstream network during the delay period in the delayed condition."

Given that the striatum and the STN are the two input structures of the BG network and that STN neuronal responses were more strongly correlated with BG downstream neuronal responses, compared to striatal MSN responses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), we suggest that the STN might orchestrate the time-varying I/D balance in the BG downstream network.

In addition, we showed that this pathological oscillatory activity, at least at the level of spiking activity, was not shared by all BG neuronal components in parkinsonism (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figures 10</a> and <a href=\"#fig11\">11</a>).

The lack of oscillatory activity of MSNs in the MPTP-treated monkey is consistent with our unpublished observations of no oscillatory spiking activity in the striatum of parkinsonian human patients undergoing DBS procedures. However, not all components of striatal activity were deprived of abnormal oscillatory activity after MPTP intoxication. Indeed, as already described in earlier studies of TANs in MPTP-treated monkeys (<a href=\"#bib91\">Raz et al., 1996</a>), we found that TANs also exhibited 10\u2009Hz oscillatory activity. This MSN-TAN incongruity is in line with the view of a weak functional in vivo connectivity between MSNs and TANs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Adler et al., 2013b</a>) and probably reflects their different synaptic drives."

On the other hand, in the dopamine-depleted striatum, only TAN (single- and multi-unit) spiking activity was phase locked to the striatal 8\u201315\u2009Hz LFP oscillations.

Therefore, given the consistency of the spike-field coherence results using spike trains of isolated MSNs (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a>) or striatal MUAs (<a href=\"#fig14s1\">Figure 14\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the absence of coherence between MSN spiking activity and LFP after MPTP intoxication was most likely not confounded by the slow MSN discharge.

Nevertheless, the striatum obviously remains a major player in BG functioning in health and disease. Striatal dopaminergic input is involved not only in the modulation of the efficacy of the cortico-striatal synapses (<a href=\"#bib93\">Reynolds et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Shen et al., 2008</a>), but also in the excitability of the striatal projection neuron (<a href=\"#bib81\">Nicola et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Onn et al., 2000</a>). Thus, the coincidence of cortical/thalamic and midbrain dopaminergic activity might be a necessary condition for MSN spike generation. Consequently, MSN spiking activity would be shaped by striatal inputs only during brief, but functionally important periods (probably marked by transient dopaminergic activity). This refined control of striatal output patterns was probably undetected in the current population analysis."

Therefore, the study of the neuronal activity along the BG network in similar classical (but also operant) conditioning tasks using MPTP-treated monkeys that exhibit moderate parkinsonian symptoms is undoubtedly a necessary step that should enhance our understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of the BG. However, the unique anatomical and physiological features of the STN highlighted in the current study provide a concrete explanation for the efficacy of the inactivation of the STN in MPTP-treated monkeys (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bergman et al., 1990</a>), human patients (<a href=\"#bib5\">Alvarez et al., 2005</a>) and STN-DBS in MPTP-treated monkeys (<a href=\"#bib11\">Benazzouz et al., 1993</a>) and parkinsonian patients to alleviate BG-related motor (<a href=\"#bib83\">Odekerken et al., 2016</a>) and non-motor (<a href=\"#bib64\">Lhomm\u00e9e et al., 2012</a>) clinical symptoms."

Six different fractal visual cues were presented for 2\u2009s. The cues used here were full-screen isoluminant images generated using ChaosPro 3.2 program (www.chaospro.de) and displayed on a 21 inch LCD monitor, located 50 cm in front of the monkeys' faces. Cues predicted either a food outcome, an airpuff outcome (directed at both eyes) or neither of them, thus grouping them into three categories: appetitive/rewarding, aversive and neutral cues. For each category, depending on the cue, its offset was either immediately followed by the outcome period (immediate condition) or by a 6-s delay period which preceded the outcome period (delayed condition). This delay period was chosen on the basis of previous studies indicating that monkeys engaged in a delayed-release task maintain central fixation for no more than 4\u2009s (<a href=\"#bib102\">Slovin et al., 1999</a>) and that trial-over-trial behavioral learning of monkeys during smooth pursuit eye movement task is forgotten within 6\u2009s (<a href=\"#bib111\">Yang and Lisberger, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib112\">2014</a>). The outcome period (0.15\u2009s) was signaled by one of three sounds that differentiated the three possible outcomes (food, airpuff or no outcome) and was followed by a variable inter-trial interval (ITI) of 6\u201310\u2009s. Fractal images and sounds were swapped between the two monkeys."

Moreover, the abnormal neuronal activity associated with parkinsonism is relatively consistent across STN and output nuclei, but not present in striatal projection neurons. These results are taken as evidence that the STN is the primary driver of neuronal activity in BG output neurons under both normal and pathologic conditions."

This is an interesting study that regroups, in one experimental design, several notions that were so far scattered into different pieces of literature. In that respect it is a novel and informative study that takes advantage of well-defined methodologies routinely used in the contributing team. This reviewer wishes to express two concerns: the first is the lack of systematic approach caused by the use of a harsh MPTP intoxication procedure. While the first 6 figures deal with an elegant study of the whole BG physiology during a temporal discounting classical conditioning task, such investigation is not made possible by the \"severe\" parkinsonian syndrome displayed by the animals. Slower regimens of intoxication enable to produce dopa-responsive parkinsonian monkeys capable of operant behaviour. The resulting disconnection between part I (first 6 figures) and part II (following figures) sections dampen this reviewer's enthusiasm. The second concern is that no detailed anatomo-pathological study accompanies the comprehensive physiological investigations. It is surprising, especially given the low n of animals, that no post-mortem assessment has been performed. MPTP-induced dopamine neuron (and terminals) degeneration should have been studied so that the extent and pattern of neurodegeneration is characterized in the vicinity of recording tracks. A high magnification dopamine fibers (TH, DAT, VMAT) counting possibly associated with a direct anti-DA immunohistochemistry should be performed in all BG recorded structures in order to assess the striatal vs extra-striatal impact of MPTP-induced lesions. Indeed, MPTP induces a loss of DA terminals not only in the striatum but as well in all BG nuclei although with disparate intensities."

Therefore, it is important to show that persistent modulatory activity (i.e., during prolonged delays between sensory perception and action, especially when sensory information is no longer available) is not a unique property of the frontal cortex and other cortical areas, but can also be found along the BG main axis. Here, the demonstration that the BG main axis generates persistent modulatory activities is in line with the model that the BG main axis is able to convert transient sensory inputs into persistent internal representations. These BG persistent representations can be held and evaluated until they can be used later by the cortical and brainstem motor centers to guide the optimal action/response."

Therefore, we believe that although quantitative data are still lacking, we can assume (in line with Mink, 1996; Nambu et al., 2002 and many others) that the STN output is broadly distributed in the BG downstream structures. Nevertheless, we made the necessary changes in the Discussion of the revised manuscript to clarify that evidence for STN output divergence is still slim."

While the first 6 figures deal with an elegant study of the whole BG physiology during a temporal discounting classical conditioning task, such investigation is not made possible by the \"severe\" parkinsonian syndrome displayed by the animals. Slower regimens of intoxication enable to produce dopa-responsive parkinsonian monkeys capable of operant behaviour. The resulting disconnection between part I (first 6 figures) and part II (following figures) sections dampen this reviewer's enthusiasm.</i>"

The use of MPTP-treated monkeys that exhibit moderate parkinsonian symptoms is undoubtedly a necessary step that would broaden our understanding of the physiology and the pathophysiology of the BG, as well as the early stages of Parkinson's disease."

Indeed, previous studies (Leblois et al., Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26(6):1701-1713) failed to find BG oscillatory activity in early stages of chronic MPTP treatment. In addition, it has been shown that severe MPTP-treated monkeys usually develop stable clinical symptoms (Potts et al., Exp. Neurol. 2014; 256:133-143). In our study, the stability of the clinical symptoms in the MPTP-treated monkeys was a critical issue. Given the relatively long period of recordings after induction of parkinsonism (due to the number of BG structures in which we had to record \u2013 striatum, STN, GPe and SNr) we had to guarantee the stability of the parkinsonian symptoms in both animals during the entire duration of the recordings to be able to further compare activities at the different stages of the BG."

It is surprising, especially given the low n of animals, that no post-mortem assessment has been performed. MPTP-induced dopamine neuron (and terminals) degeneration should have been studied so that the extent and pattern of neurodegeneration is characterized in the vicinity of recording tracks. A high magnification dopamine fibers (TH, DAT, VMAT) counting possibly associated with a direct anti-DA immunohistochemistry should be performed in all BG recorded structures in order to assess the striatal vs extra-striatal impact of MPTP-induced lesions. Indeed, MPTP induces a loss of DA terminals not only in the striatum but as well in all BG nuclei although with disparate intensities.</i>"

Briefly, the results showed that both MPTP-treated monkeys (in comparison with healthy animals) exhibited a large dopamine depletion in the dorsal striatum (i.e., caudate nucleus and putamen) similar to that observed in the brain of human patients suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease. Therefore, at this stage, even though we cannot assess dopamine degeneration of the STN and BG downstream structures in the parkinsonian state, we are confident of the validity of our non-human primate model of Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, we did the necessary changes in the Discussion of the revised manuscript to highlight this point."
