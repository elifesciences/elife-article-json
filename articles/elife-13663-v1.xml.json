We describe here the identification of an intracellular trigger of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1\u03b2 production and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages that is mediated by disruption of glycolytic flux. This signal results from a drop of NADH levels and induction of mitochondrial ROS production and can be rescued by addition of products that restore NADH production. This signal is also important for host cell response to the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, which can disrupt metabolism by uptake of host cell glucose. These results reveal an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens."
