We studied the role of calcium-activator protein for secretion (CAPS) proteins in neuronal DCV secretion at single vesicle resolution. Endogenous CAPS-1 co-localized with synaptic markers but was not enriched at every synapse. Deletion of CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 did not affect DCV biogenesis, loading, transport or docking, but DCV secretion was reduced by 70% in CAPS-1/CAPS-2 double null mutant (DKO) neurons and remaining fusion events required prolonged stimulation. CAPS deletion specifically reduced secretion of stationary DCVs. CAPS-1-EYFP expression in DKO neurons restored DCV secretion, but CAPS-1-EYFP and DCVs rarely traveled together. Synaptic localization of CAPS-1-EYFP in DKO neurons was calcium dependent and DCV fusion probability correlated with synaptic CAPS-1-EYFP expression. These data indicate that CAPS-1 promotes fusion competence of immobile (tethered) DCVs in presynaptic terminals and that CAPS-1 localization to DCVs is probably not essential for this role."

We studied the role of calcium-activator protein for secretion (CAPS) proteins in neuronal DCV secretion at single vesicle resolution. Endogenous CAPS-1 co-localized with synaptic markers but was not enriched at every synapse. Deletion of CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 did not affect DCV biogenesis, loading, transport or docking, but DCV secretion was reduced by 70% in CAPS-1/CAPS-2 double null mutant (DKO) neurons and remaining fusion events required prolonged stimulation. CAPS deletion specifically reduced secretion of stationary DCVs. CAPS-1-EYFP expression in DKO neurons restored DCV secretion, but CAPS-1-EYFP and DCVs rarely traveled together. Synaptic localization of CAPS-1-EYFP in DKO neurons was calcium dependent and DCV fusion probability correlated with synaptic CAPS-1-EYFP expression. These data indicate that CAPS-1 promotes fusion competence of immobile (tethered) DCVs in presynaptic terminals and that CAPS-1 localization to DCVs is probably not essential for this role."

These neuromodulators are transported in dense-core vesicles (DCVs). Dysregulation of DCV transport and fusion is associated with cognitive and post-traumatic stress disorders (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sadakata et al., 2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sah and Geracioti, 2013</a>). DCVs bud off at the Golgi network (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2006</a>) and are transported via microtubule-based motor proteins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hirokawa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schlager and Hoogenraad, 2009</a>). High-frequency firing facilitates DCV fusion and the resultant calcium influx triggers SNARE complex-dependent DCV secretion (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartfai et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hartmann et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">de Wit et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</a>). Unlike synaptic vesicles (SVs), DCVs lack a local recycling mechanism. To ensure a constant and uniform supply of DCVs at release sites, DCVs are generally very dynamic although some DCVs are stationary. Stimulation triggers arrest of moving DCVs (<a href=\"#bib10\">de Wit et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Shakiryanova et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Matsuda et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wong et al., 2012</a>), probably promoting their local availability for secretion. DCV fusion sites can be located in the entire neuron but DCVs preferentially fuse at presynaptic terminals and release at extra-synaptic sites requires more robust stimulation (<a href=\"#bib55\">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</a>). Recently, we have shown that Munc13 is an important regulator of DCV fusion at synapses (<a href=\"#bib55\">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</a>). However, in contrast to SV release, a comprehensive insight in the molecular mechanisms of DCV secretion is still lacking."

Mutants of the <i>C. elegans</i> CAPS ortholog UNC-31 show reduced peptide release without affecting synaptic vesicle fusion (<a href=\"#bib51\">Speese et al., 2007</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i> neurons, UNC-31 is required for the docking of DCVs at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hammarlund et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lin et al., 2010</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, deletion of dCAPS also affects DCV release but in contrast to <i>C. elegans</i>, leads to an increased DCV presence in terminals (<a href=\"#bib38\">Renden et al., 2001</a>). Mammals express two CAPS genes, CAPS-1 and CAPS-2, which are complementarily expressed in brain (<a href=\"#bib53\">Speidel et al., 2003</a>) and are essential for synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jockusch et al., 2007</a>). In adrenal chromaffin cells, CAPS-1 deletion affects catecholamine uptake in chromaffin granules (<a href=\"#bib52\">Speidel et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brunk et al., 2009</a>) and deletion of CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 abolishes their fusion without affecting docking (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). CAPS-2 is important for cerebellar development and neuron survival (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sadakata et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2007a</a>), and deletion of CAPS-1 in cerebellar neurons perturbs DCV trafficking (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sadakata et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2013</a>). Hence, these studies suggest that CAPS proteins are involved in several aspects of DCV trafficking and release in invertebrates and in mammalian chromaffin cells, but their role in mammalian versus invertebrate systems appears to differ considerably, especially regarding synaptic transmission and cell survival."

Endogenous CAPS-1 was present in puncta that partially overlapped with synaptic markers and also co-localized with DCV markers. CAPS deletion did not affect DCV biogenesis, neuropeptide loading or average DCV transport velocity. In CAPS double null mutant (DKO) neurons, DCV fusion was strongly reduced at synapses and at extra-synaptic sites. We developed a novel release assay to track single DCVs prior to fusion and found that CAPS deletion strongly affected DCV release of stationary, presumably tethered vesicles. We provide evidence that CAPS-1 localization at synapses is calcium dependent and that DCV release probability correlates with synaptic CAPS-1 expression levels."

The CAPS-1 expression pattern differed from the sub-cellular localization of the DCV priming protein Munc13-1, which was much more restricted to the synapse (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E, F</a>, Pearson's coefficient in the entire neuron: 0.64\u00b10.04, n=10) with 96% of synapses containing M13-1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, number of synapses containing M13-1: 96.3\u00b10.7%, n=4, number of synapses containing CAPS-1: 58.1\u00b110.9%, n=7). Since CAPS proteins have been initially identified as DCV resident proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berwin et al., 1998</a>), we tested the co-localization of CAPS-1 with DCVs in hippocampal neurons. Using the endogenous DCV protein chromogranin B (ChrB) we found that the majority of DCVs are located in the axon (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Antibody incompatibility precluded co-staining of CAPS-1 antibody with antibodies against ChrB. Therefore, we used the DCV cargo neuropeptide Y (NPY) fused to Venus (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nagai et al., 2002</a>), which showed more than 80% co-localization with this endogenous marker (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H, I</a>, Manders' coefficients for chromogranin B in NPY-Venus puncta: 0.97\u00b10.02, and NPY-Venus in ChrB puncta: 0.84\u00b10.01, n=14). Approximately 35% of NPY-Venus labeled DCVs co-localized with endogenous CAPS-1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J\u2013L</a>, Pearson's coefficient: 0.45\u00b10.05, n=21, number of NPY-labeled DCVs co-expressing CAPS-1: 34.71\u00b13.03%, n=6). These data show that endogenous CAPS-1 is present at many but not all synapses. In addition, CAPS-1 domains are found at extra-synaptic regions and CAPS-1 partly co-localizes with DCV markers."

The fluorescence intensity distribution of single DCV release events measured with the DCV cargo Semaphorin-3A coupled to pH-sensitve GFP (SemapHluorin, see below) in WT and CAPS DKO cells was similar; indicating that SemapHluorin loading of fusing DCVs was not affected in CAPS DKO neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To analyze SemapHluorin loading of all DCVs in the cell, we quantified the fluorescence intensity of SemapHluorin labeled DCVs upon application of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (which instantly de-quenches all intra-vesicular pHluorin, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and of antibody-labeled endogenous DCV cargo protein, secretogranin II, in WT and CAPS DKO neurons. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> application showed that loading of SemapHluorin was comparable between WT and CAPS DKO neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C, D</a>). Also, fluorescence intensity levels of secretogranin II were unchanged between WT and CAPS DKO neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). As neuronal viability is affected in CAPS-2 null mutant cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sadakata et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2007a</a>), we analyzed neuronal morphology and DCV numbers in CAPS DKO neurons and did not find differences between WT and DKO neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013H</a>).

First, DCVs were labeled with the secreted axon-guidance protein Semaphorin 3A coupled to the pH-sensitive enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) variant, pHluorin (SemapHluorin, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A, B</a>) and release was measured in CAPS-1/CAPS-2 DKO (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jockusch et al., 2007</a>) and WT hippocampal neurons in DIV 14 mass cultures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

Electrical stimulation triggers calcium and SNARE protein-dependent membrane fusion. Opening of the fusion pore results in a sudden dequenching of vesicular SemapHluorin and increase in fluorescence (asterisk). This is scored as fusion event in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,vE</a>. Upon the sudden increase in fluorescence the signal either remains high (<b>A</b>: persistent event) or dims to baseline (<b>B</b>: transient event). Transient events represent incomplete release followed by vesicle retrieval and re-acidification (B1) or full release followed by cargo diffusion (B2). In B2 the vesicle may integrate into the plasma membrane or re-seal without SemapHluorin cargo (B2, grey box top and bottom panel, respectively). Persistent events reflect the continuous presence of cargo at the cell surface and may either represent stable deposits of SemapHluorin or vesicles with a permanently open fusion pore (<b>A</b>, grey box top and bottom panel, respectively). Persistent events are typical for cargo that interacts with the intra-vesicular matrix like Semaphorin. These events are very rare when using NPY as cargo. Our previous analysis of fusion events reported by SemapHluorin showed that 60% of fusion events are transient events of which half result in full release and 40% of events are persistent (<a href=\"#bib11\">de Wit et al., 2009</a>). The typical example traces show persistent and transient fusion events. Both types of events were scored as fusion events in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C, E</a> when fluorescence increased above two times the standard deviation of the initial fluorescence (grey dotted line)."

CAPS-1 is present at synapses and co-localizes with DCV markers but rarely travels together with dynamic DCVs. Using two DCV secretion assays we found that CAPS-1 deletion strongly impaired synaptic and extra-synaptic DCV release in hippocampal neurons. CAPS-1 deletion did not reduce the presence or docking of DCVs at synaptic sites, but strongly affected DCV secretion of stationary DCVs. Synaptic expression levels of CAPS-1 were modulated by neuronal activity and correlated with DCV release probability. CAPS-1 thus functions as a priming protein at synaptic and extra-synaptic sites, promoting the fusion competence of stationary DCVs."

This suggests that CAPS-1 might be a DCV resident protein that is delivered to sites of exocytosis on DCVs. However, we observed that in mammalian neurons endogenous CAPS-1 localized in axonal and dendritic domains that often, but not always, co-localized with synaptic and DCV markers. Cell-wide CAPS-1 co-localization with the canonical DCV marker NPY yielded an average co-localization of only 35%. Furthermore, in CAPS DKO neurons rescued with CAPS-1-EYFP, DCVs and CAPS-1-EYFP only rarely traveled together. Finally, the increased dynamics of synaptic CAPS-1-EYFP with CAPS-1 redistribution upon stimulation are best explained by diffusion (see below) but not with a redistribution of vesicular CAPS-1. Thus, in mature mammalian neurons, CAPS-1 does not appear to be a general DCV-resident protein, but a dynamic, cytosolic factor translocating to synapses and extra-synaptic sites in an activity-dependent manner to promote fusion of pre-docked (tethered) DCVs."

In addition, analysis of DCV dynamics in our live cell imaging experiments and intra-synaptic localization on electron micrographs of CAPS DKO neurons revealed that CAPS-1 deletion does not affect DCV trafficking along microtubules, synaptic accumulation and membrane docking of DCVs. Together, this suggests that in mature neurons most CAPS-1 molecules interact with DCVs after these vesicles arrived at the plasma membrane. This conclusion is consistent with observations in <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junctions where deletion of dCaps results in an increase in the number of DCVs present at synapses (<a href=\"#bib38\">Renden et al., 2001</a>) and the lack of a docking defect upon deletion of CAPS-1/-2 in adrenal chromaffin cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). However, chemical fixation used in our study might produce artifacts that change the precise distance between vesicles and the membrane. As a consequence, vesicles touching the membrane in fixed tissue may in fact have been at a short distance from the membrane. Recent excellent work using cryo-fixation and EM tomography to analyse docking of SVs and DCVs in central synapses of several mutant mouse strains including CAPS DKO showed that SV docking is impaired in CAPS DKO neurons. In line with our findings, DCVs were present in similar numbers in CAPS DKO synapses. However, although not statistically significant, the distribution of DCVs within 200 nm of the active zone appeared to be reduced (<a href=\"#bib19\">Imig et al., 2014</a>). Hence, general consensus exists on a post-synapse delivery role for CAPS but future studies using cryo-fixation might unmask (subtle) docking defects upon CAPS loss."

CAPS-1 changes the conformation of syntaxin-1 from a state incompatible with SNARE-complex formation (\u2018closed-state\u2019), to a state that allows formation of functional SNARE complexes (\u2018open-state\u2019), as release in CAPS DKO chromaffin cells is rescued by expression of an \u2018open\u2019-variant of syntaxin-1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2010</a>) and overexpression of open syntaxin can bypass the requirement for CAPS in DCV docking in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hammarlund et al., 2008</a>). CAPS-1 shares this characteristic with Munc13-1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Augustin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</a>). CAPS and Munc13 proteins may operate in the same molecular priming pathway (<a href=\"#bib40\">Richmond et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jockusch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>) in a non-redundant manner. The fact that both proteins appear to bind syntaxin-1 via different binding modes may account for this non-redundancy (<a href=\"#bib36\">Parsaud et al., 2013</a>). A recent paper indeed showed that CAPS-2 and Munc13 use different mechanisms to prime vesicles, whereas Munc13-dependent priming requires its MUN domain this domain in CAPS-2 is dispensable for priming. Instead CAPS-2 appears to require its PIP2 binding pleckstrin homology domain (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nguyen Truong et al., 2014</a>). We found that both proteins play important stimulatory roles in DCV release from mammalian neurons. However, functional differences were evident: CAPS-1 deletion resulted in a larger reduction of DCV release events compared to deletion of Munc13-1 with a \u00b170% reduction in CAPS DKO (this study) and \u00b160% reduction in Munc13 DKO neurons (<a href=\"#bib55\">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</a>). For synaptic vesicle fusion the situation is opposite: Munc13 DKO neurons clearly show larger defects in synaptic transmission than CAPS DKO neurons (<a href=\"#bib57\">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jockusch et al., 2007</a>)."

Munc13-1 expression is strictly synaptic and specifically supports DCV secretion from synapses, while being dispensable for extra-synaptic secretion (<a href=\"#bib55\">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, CAPS-1 accumulations are found at many synapses, but not all, and at extra-synaptic sites along neurites. Also, CAPS-1 deletion equally affects DCV release from synapses and from extra-synaptic sites. Finally, CAPS-1 redistributes from synapses during activity while Munc13-1 does not (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kalla et al., 2006</a>). These differences in (re)distribution suggest that (1) CAPS-1 domains at extra-synaptic sites promote DCV release independently of Munc13-1. However, CAPS-1-dependent extra-synaptic release is less efficient than synaptic DCV release, which indicates that the concerted action of CAPS-1 and Munc13-1 is most efficient in priming DCVs for release. (2) At synapses, CAPS-1 and Munc13-1 have non-redundant roles in promoting DCV release, similar to their non-redundancy in SV release (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jockusch et al., 2007</a>). The larger effect of CAPS deletion on DCV release may be explained by the additional reduction of extra-synaptic release events compared to Munc13-1 deletion. Finally, some extra-synaptic DCV release remained in CAPS DKO neurons indicating that extra-synaptic DCV release can occur in the absence of CAPS and Munc13 albeit with very low release probability."

This redistribution was very similar to synapsin-ECFP (our work and <a href=\"#bib40\">Richmond et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Parsaud et al., 2013</a>) and is also reported for other synaptic proteins like Rab3a (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tsuriel et al., 2009</a>), Syntaxin-1 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ribrault et al., 2011</a>) and Munc18 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cijsouw et al., 2014</a>) and for SVs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheung and Cousin, 2011</a>). In contrast, the mobility of active zone proteins like Munc13-1 and Bassoon is not affected by acute stimulation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kalla et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tsuriel et al., 2009</a>). Hence, synapses rapidly exchange part of their components during high frequency stimulation. This allows synapses to adapt their release probability during and directly after stimulation as we showed for Munc18-1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cijsouw et al., 2014</a>). This is also an attractive explanation for the re-distribution of CAPS-1 as we found that synapses with increased CAPS-1 expression levels had a higher release probability than synapses with low/no CAPS-1. CAPS-1 binds to PI 4,5-P2 (PIP2) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Loyet et al., 1998</a>) and localizes to PIP2 clusters in the plasma membrane via its PIP2-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (<a href=\"#bib20\">James et al., 2008</a>). The PH domain is also required to prime secretory vesicles (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kabachinski et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Nguyen Truong et al., 2014</a>). Robust Ca2+ influx in our experiments likely activates phospholipase C, which hydrolysis PIP2 and may trigger CAPS-1 dispersion from synapses. Hence, calcium-dependent PIP2 hydrolysis may act as negative feedback mechanism reducing CAPS-1 availability at the synapse after robust stimulation. In addition to direct membrane interaction, CAPS-1 also binds syntaxin via its MUN domain. Syntaxin also disperses from synapses resulting in CAPS-1 co-dispersion. As Munc13-1 does not show activity-dependent redistribution among synapses but instead increases its membrane-bound fraction upon calcium influx, synapses appear to utilize two distinct mechanisms to control release probabilities during/after high frequency stimulation."

A 2\u00d72 pixel region (0.4\u00d70.4 \u03bcm) was analyzed according to the experiment as follows. Sema and NPY-pHluorin: fluorescent traces were expressed as fluorescence change (\u2206F) compared to initial fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub>), obtained by averaging the first four frames of the time-lapse recording. A fusion event was counted when fluorescence showed a sudden increase two standard deviations above F<sub>0</sub>. Onset of fusion was defined as the first frame with an increase of fluorescence of two standard deviations above F<sub>0</sub>. A cargo-pHl release event or punctum was scored as synaptic when the fluorescence center of such a release event/punctum was within 200 nm (\u00b11 pixel, the approximate minimal point spread function of our system) of the Synapsin-mCherry fluorescence centroid. Extra-synaptic events were all events that did not meet this criterion. We only measured release events from neurites and excluded somatic release events. Somatic release events cannot be reliably measured using wide-field fluorescence microcopy due to the bright fluorescence from vesicles in/near the Golgi apparatus in which the intraluminal pH is not yet acidic. The total number of vesicles was automatically analyzed from the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> application time lapse using SynD software (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schmitz et al., 2011</a>). When using NPY-mCherry: only the fusion events were scored in which NPY-mCherry fluorescence completely disappeared from a 2\u00d72 pixel punctum after bleaching correction (ImageJ Bleaching correction plug-in). DCVs were categorized as stationary or moving based on the slope of the Kymopgraph (ImageJ, MultipleKymograph), if the slope of the line over the kymograph was different from 0 at any point of the movie, the DCV was considered moving."

Ultrathin sections (\u223c90 nm) were cut parallel to the cell monolayer and collected on single-slot, formvar-coated copper grids, and stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Synapses were selected at low magnification using a JEOL 1010 electron microscope. All analyses were performed on single ultrathin sections of randomly selected synapses. The distribution of DCVs was measured with ImageJ on digital images of synapses taken at 100,000\u00d7 magnification using analysis software (Soft Imaging System, Gmbh, Germany). The observer was blinded for the genotype. For all morphological analyses we selected only synapses with intact synaptic plasma membranes with a recognizable pre and postsynaptic density.

They used mouse KO, cultured neurons particularly autotaptic, electrophysiology and time-lapsed imaging to reach this conclusion. The authors examine subcellular CAPS-1 localization, DCV localization, DCV loading, DCV docking and fusion in CAPS DKO mutants. The main conclusion of this paper is that CAPS is involved in priming DCVs in neurons, but the manuscript explores CAPS function in detail at many levels and touches on many controversies. There are a large number of conclusions from these data, many at odds with existing literature. The experiments in this manuscript are well designed and executed. Although a role for CAPS in DCV priming is well-established, this manuscript represents the most complete study of CAPS function in DCV secretion in neurons."

They show time course for fluorescent decrease for an event with the latter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) but not the former. There are several mistaken notions in these studies. Full release of cargo (shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) implies nothing about the mode of fusion other than the fusion pore has dilated sufficiently to allow full cargo release. The fusion pore may dilate and reclose and still allow full release of NPY-mCherry (or NPY-pHluorin, not shown). Differences in numbers of events detected with each NPY fusion protein is very likely due to sensitivity of detection, looking for a decrease in red compared to a 100x increase in green fluorescence. This entire section seems to be mistakenly rationalized and inadequately documented."

Furthermore, they cite <a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al. 2010</a> (Introduction section) as a <i>Drosophila</i> study; in fact this paper assays fusion in chromaffin cells. As the authors suggest, no defect in DCV docking was observed in chromaffin cells by <a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2010</a>. The authors reference <a href=\"#bib15\">Hammarlund (2008)</a> for demonstrating that the MUN domains of CAPS and Munc13 bind syntaxin differently. The correct reference is <a href=\"#bib36\">Parsaud et al., 2013</a>. The <a href=\"#bib15\">Hammarlund (2008)</a> paper is in complete disagreement with this manuscript, nevertheless the authors should cite this manuscript for first demonstrating that open syntaxin bypasses the requirement for CAPs (paragraph two of the subsection \u201cA post-docking role for CAPS-1 in DCVs Fusion\u201d in the Discussion).

The authors used the first of these techniques and note in the text that their results (lack of effect of CAPS KO on docking) differ from results in <i>C. elegans</i>. Importantly, the <i>C. elegans</i> results utilized rapid freeze EM. Because of known shrinkage and fixation artifacts in conventional EM, the authors should refrain from using the term docking but describe their results as DCVs close to the membrane by EM. It may well be the case when re-examined using other techniques, that there are effects of CAPS deletion on DCV docking as has been shown for Munc13-1."

This issue can be considered minor but some further clarification would be useful. In the original version of the manuscript, increased fluorescence of a pHluorin construct (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) versus complete loss of fluorescence of an mCherry construct (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) were interpreted to indicate fusion pore opening and full fusion, respectively. The revised manuscript more appropriately describes what these data indicate but it remains unclear whether these data support the interim conclusion that \u201cincomplete and complete cargo release events were affected (by CAPS KO) to the same extent\u201d. It depends on how these experiments were done. If they were done as suggested in the rebuttal letter: \u201cwe compared fusion pore opening (step-like increases in the green channel) to full cargo release (complete loss of signal in the red channel) and concluded that fusion pore openings occur more often than full cargo release\u201d using both channels to detect single events, then the authors' conclusion would stand because they would show pHluorin brightening events that were accompanied by complete or incomplete mCherry loss. If this is the case, the figure legend should indicate this and the authors could consider showing traces pHluorin brightening that were accompanied by either complete or incomplete mCherry loss. If, however, the number of pHluorin brightening\u2019s and mCherry complete losses were determined independently, then it could be the case that sensitivity of event detection favors pHluorin brightening events. From what is currently described in the manuscript, it is unclear."

We have recently shown that synaptic dispersion and reclustering of Munc18-1 allows neurons to modulate synaptic strength upon network activity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cijsouw et al., 2014</a>). Reclustering of Munc18-1 required PKC activation and was syntaxin 1 independent. CAPS1 membrane association requires its PIP2-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Robust Ca2+ influx in our experiments likely activates phospholipase C (PLC) which hydrolysis PIP2 and may trigger CAPS1 dispersion from synapses. Recent work on CAPS2 shows that the PH-domain is required to prime vesicles (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nguyen Truong et al, 2014</a>). Calcium-dependent PIP2 hydrolysis may therefore act as negative feedback mechanism reducing CAPS1 availability at the synapse upon robust activity. In addition to direct membrane interaction, CAPS1 also binds syntaxin via its MUN domain. Syntaxin also disperses from synapses, which may result in CAPS1 co-dispersion. We added this to the Discussion \u201d This is also an attractive explanation[\u2026]after high frequency stimulation\u201d."
