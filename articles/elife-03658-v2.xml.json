However, the mechanisms underlying this regulation are poorly understood because the inherent stochasticity and low probability of spontaneous fusion events has curtailed their visualization at individual release sites. Here, using pH-sensitive optical probes targeted to synaptic vesicles, we visualized single spontaneous fusion events and found that they are retrieved extremely rapidly with faster re-acidification kinetics than their action potential-evoked counterparts. These fusion events were coupled to postsynaptic NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, and at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations there was an increase in the number of vesicles that would undergo fusion. Furthermore, spontaneous vesicle fusion propensity in a synapse was Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent but regulated autonomously: independent of evoked fusion probability at the same synapse. Taken together, these results expand classical quantal analysis to incorporate endocytic and exocytic phases of single fusion events and uncover autonomous regulation of spontaneous fusion."

The vesicles contain molecules called neurotransmitters, which are then released into the gap between the neurons. When these molecules bind to receptors on the surface of the second neuron, a copy of the action potential is generated and travels along the second neuron. The empty vesicles are then reabsorbed back into the first cell to be refilled with neurotransmitters so that the whole process can be repeated."

In addition to the well-established role of AP-evoked neurotransmitter release in information transfer and processing, a growing number of studies assign a key role for spontaneous release in synaptic homeostasis and plasticity (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sutton and Schuman, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kavalali et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hawkins, 2013</a>). Recent work indicates that these two modes of neurotransmission are largely independent in terms of their presynaptic regulation as well as postsynaptic signaling consequences (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sara et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sutton et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Atasoy et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Melom et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nosyreva et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wierda and Sorensen, 2014</a>). However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the segregation of the two forms of release are only beginning to be elucidated (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hua et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Pang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ramirez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bal et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). There is strong evidence that synaptic vesicles recycle at rest in the absence of presynaptic APs and take up exogenous probes such as FM dyes, antibodies or horseradish peroxidase (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ryan et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Murthy and Stevens, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sara et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Peng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kavalali and Jorgensen, 2014</a>). Studies also suggest that endocytic mechanisms mediating synaptic vesicle retrieval after spontaneous fusion diverge from those that trigger endocytosis after AP-evoked exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chung et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Peng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Meng et al., 2013</a>). However, visualizing single spontaneous vesicle fusion and retrieval events has been technically difficult as the stochastic nature and low probability of spontaneous fusion requires long-term imaging with high temporal resolution, which typically gives rise to significant photobleaching and potential photodamage. Earlier attempts at detecting spontaneous synaptic vesicle exo-endocytosis using capacitance measurements heavily relied on signal averaging and was confounded by susceptibility to contamination by capacitance changes unrelated to synaptic vesicle exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sun et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yamashita et al., 2005</a>)."

In this study, we used the vesicular glutamate transporter or the vesicle protein synaptophysin as carriers for luminal pH-sensitive fluorescent probes and optimized imaging conditions to minimize photobleaching without compromising our ability to detect a majority of spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion events. Our optical recording conditions were similar to our earlier work where we characterized single AP-evoked fusion events with a median probability of 0.2 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</a>) indicating that these settings enable visualization of release from single boutons (<a href=\"#bib31\">Murthy et al., 1997</a>). Under these conditions, we found that single synaptic vesicles are retrieved extremely rapidly (&lt;370 ms) after spontaneous fusion indicating the fluorescence decay of individual events was dominated by vesicle re-acidification. These spontaneous fusion events were coupled to postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals as supported by their temporal and spatial juxtaposition to D(\u2212)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5)-sensitive fluorescence signals originating from a Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator targeted to postsynaptic densities. Surprisingly, we uncovered a significant fraction of putative multiquantal events that increased in prevalence at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Furthermore, we could not detect appreciable correlation between the propensities of evoked and spontaneous fusion events at increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. These experiments demonstrated that spontaneous fusion propensity in a given synapse is regulated autonomously and independently of evoked release probability. Taken together, these results expand classical quantal analysis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Del Castillo and Katz, 1954</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Boyd and Martin, 1956</a>) to incorporate exocytic and endocytic phases of single fusion events and provide insight into the properties and regulation of single spontaneous fusion events in relation to their AP-evoked counterparts that originate from the same synaptic bouton."

These increases in fluorescence were distinguishable from noise and could be fit with a single Gaussian curve of mean amplitude of 623 \u00b1 122 a.u (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>) and average \u0394F/F of 3.8 \u00b1 0.93%. These events decayed rapidly with a weighted average decay time constant (heretofore referred to as \u2018decay time\u2019) of 0.29 \u00b1 0.017 s. However, the decay times of these events were distributed according to a non-geometric \u03b2-function with a non-geometric average fluorescence decay time of 0.37 s and median decay time of 0.28 s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Moreover, in contrast to our earlier observations (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</a>), the fluorescence decay of these spontaneous events proceeded immediately following fluorescence increase without any observable dwell time. To confirm that these rapidly decaying increases in fluorescence were due to genuine spontaneous vesicle fusion, we sought to manipulate the rate of decay by addition of 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl in the extracellular solution. Indeed, equiosmolar substitution of extracellular NaCl with 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl slowed vesicle reacidification to an average decay time of 0.55 s with median decay time 0.32 s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>) indicating that the decay phase of these events was dominated by vesicle re-acidification. We then compared these spontaneous fluorescence increases to those evoked by single action potential stimulation in the absence of TTX (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013I</a>). We found that fusion events evoked by stimulation had a mean fluorescence amplitude of 641 \u00b1 171 a.u. (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), similar to spontaneous fluorescence increases. However, these events decayed more slowly with average decay time of 0.83 s and median decay time of 0.83 s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). Finally, to evaluate whether we were able to visualize the entirety of the fluorescent signal originating from spontaneous vesicle fusion events, we incubated neurons with the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor, folimycin (80 nM), and measured spontaneous increases in fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J,K</a>). In the presence of folimycin, increases in fluorescence take on a staircase-like waveform with mean amplitude of 609 \u00b1 195 a.u. (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>), similar to that of spontaneous fusion events observed in the absence of folimycin. There were no significant differences in the mean amplitude between spontaneous increases in fluorescence with or without folimycin and those that were evoked by stimulation (ANOVA p value &gt;0.5). However, when comparing amplitude distributions there was a significant difference between spontaneous events in the absence of folimycin and both spontaneous events in the presence of folimycin and action-potential evoked single vesicle fusion events (KS<sub>test</sub> &lt; 0.05 Dmax = 0.08 at bin 450 a.u.) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>). This result suggests that while we were able to acquire the entire fluorescence waveform of the majority of spontaneous fusion events, there remains a small population of low amplitude events that we were unable to detect due to the rapid decay of fluorescence signals. Regardless, our results still indicate a clear divergence in the reacidification rate between vesicles that recycle at rest and those that fuse in response to action potentials."

                                "text": "To investigate the relationship between these fast spontaneous increases in presynaptic fluorescence to postsynaptic receptor activation, we moved to a dual-color system utilizing the red-shifted pHluorin variant, pHTomato, fused to the presynaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin (SypHTomato) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li and Tsien, 2012</a>) and the green fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, GCaMP5K, fused to the post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95-GCaMP5K) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akerboom et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, we excluded extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through postsynaptic NMDA receptors. In this setting we can verify presynaptic vesicle fusion events in the red channel using the resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the green channel as a coincidence detector of a successful presynaptic fusion event (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). However, this system is not without caveats: first, because we are now monitoring two wavelengths our temporal resolution decreased from &gt;8 Hz to \u223c4 Hz; second, SypHTomato results in an elevated surface expression level compared to vGlut-pHluorin that required a post-hoc decay correction to compensate for photobleaching (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Despite these issues, spontaneous increases in SypHTomato fluorescence were still detected and were distinguishable from noise with mean amplitude of 303 \u00b1 92 a.u. (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and \u0394F/F of 1.9 \u00b1 0.67%. In 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> approximately 69% of spontaneous increases in SypHTomato elicited a PSD-95-GCaMP5K signal within \u00b11 frame, increasing to 83% between \u22121 to +5 frames. We include this \u22121 group because in our system we obtain only one time point for each cycle of imaging (i.e. one frame of red channel and one frame of green channel are both assigned the same time point). Therefore, fusion events that may occur halfway through an imaging cycle would appear shifted by \u22121 frame. Spontaneous increases in fluorescence that were correlated (within \u00b11 frame) with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were distinguishable from noise with mean amplitude of 170 \u00b1 50 a.u. (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and \u0394F/F of 2.2 \u00b1 1.3%. We next compared the amplitudes of these spontaneous fusion events with increases in fluorescence elicited by single action potential stimulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). Stimulation resulted in events that were distinguishable from noise with mean amplitude of 345 \u00b1 95 a.u. (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Although both spontaneous and AP-evoked fluorescence increases were distinguishable from noise, the small amplitude of these events combined with the rapid decay times made precise measurements of individual decay times difficult. Therefore we averaged all events within an experiment to estimate the overall average decay times (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). We found that, as with vGlut-pHluorin, spontaneous fluorescence increases in SypHTomato decayed faster than those evoked by stimulation with average decay times of 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 s and 1.0 \u00b1 1.5 s, respectively. To confirm that we were able to observe the full fluorescence increase of spontaneous fusion events with our reduced temporal resolution, we incubated neurons in folimycin and observed stepwise increases in SypHTomato fluorescence. In the same experiments to verify that the increases in the GCaMP5K fluorescence were due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through NMDA receptors, we perfused an extracellular solution containing the NMDA receptor blocker AP-5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013S</a>). We were able to identify spontaneous fusion events according to stepwise increases in SypHTomato fluorescence alone without relying on the coincidence with GCaMP5K mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013S</a>). Under these conditions, we observed spontaneous fusion events with mean amplitude of 316 \u00b1 64.9 a.u (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>) similar to both those in the absence of folimycin and those due to stimulation. Events in the same synapses in the presence of AP-5 were also similar with mean amplitude of 270 \u00b1 65 a.u. (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2M</a>). The GCaMP5K signal in the absence of AP-5 had mean amplitude of 153 \u00b1 57.6 a.u. (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2R</a>), similar to without folimycin, but in the presence of AP-5, the GCaMP signal amplitude decreased to the baseline noise, 13.2 \u00b1 56.0 a.u. (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2S</a>). Together these data complement our observations using vGlut1-pHluorin and show that spontaneous vesicle fusion events are coupled to postsynaptic NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and, following exocytosis, these vesicles are retrieved and re-acidified on a much faster time course than their AP-evoked counterparts."

                                "text": "Using presynaptic imaging similar to that used in this study, we have previously shown that increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased synaptic vesicle fusion probability and increased the likelihood of multivesicular fusion events, which is observed as an increase in fluorescence amplitude (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</a>). To assess if this scenario also applied to vesicles that fuse spontaneously, we measured the amplitude of spontaneous increases in vGlut-pHluorin fluorescence in 2, 4 and 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). Surprisingly, we found that fluorescence amplitude distributions even in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not fit well to a single Gaussian curve (D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus K2 normality test p &lt; 0.02), nor could the sum of two Gaussian curves with means at integer multiples (i.e. a quantal distribution of amplitudes indicative of two or more vesicles undergoing fusion simultaneously) account for the distribution of amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> red lines). Instead, amplitude distributions in 2 and 4 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>, respectively) were best fit by the sum of two Gaussian curves at 1 quantal mean (1q = 623 \u00b1 91 a.u., a slightly smaller standard deviation than in Figure 1) and 1.3 times the first mean (1.3q = 834 \u00b1 111 a.u.) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a> black lines). Fluorescence amplitudes in 8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> were best fit by the sum of three Gaussian curves distributed at 1 quantal mean (1q = 623 \u00b1 91 a.u.), 1.3 times the first quantal mean (1.3q = 834 \u00b1 111 a.u.) and 2 times the first quantal mean (1246 \u00b1 182 a.u.) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). This shift in fluorescence may arise from the limitations of our sampling rate and the rapid fluorescence decay time of these spontaneous events, therefore the 1.3q events may reflect two spontaneous events occurring close together in time but with a slight delay such that at our acquisition rate of &gt;8 Hz, they appear to be a single event with a normalized amplitude of 1.3q (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). To estimate the delay between two events that would be required for such a fluorescence signal, we modeled the fluorescence decay of two hypothetical spontaneous fusion events with randomly generated amplitudes within the observed first Gaussian distribution (1q) and fixed decay times of 371 ms (the average decay time of spontaneous events in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>). We used this model to generate 2000 hypothetical decay times and found that a fusion delay of 118 ms would result in an amplitude \u223c1.3 times greater than the single quantal amplitude. We then estimated the percent of fusion events that were multivesicular (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>) and found that at 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> 17% of events were multivesicular, increasing to \u223c30% in 4 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and up to 70% of events were multivesicular in 8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. While this analysis favors preponderance of multivesicular spontaneous release at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, this shift in fluorescence amplitudes could be also due to unequal distribution of pHluorin molecules within the population of spontaneously recycling synaptic vesicles selectively mobilized at higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. In addition, this fluorescence shift could arise from the preferential fusion, at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, of larger synaptic vesicles that contain more fluorophores. Given their cell biological complexity (i.e. non-homogenous impact of elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations on vesicle populations with systematic differences) we consider these two alternative scenarios unlikely. Finally, it is important to note that although this observed increase in event amplitude could be due to vesicle fusion from multiple synapses within our region of interest. This is more likely at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations as the release probability estimates we present here at 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> are consistent with release from a single release site (<a href=\"#bib31\">Murthy et al., 1997</a>)."

It is important to note that the rate of decay is approaching the limit of our temporal resolution, which is lowered in an attempt to reduce photobleaching during long imaging episodes required to identify spontaneous fusion events. Thus, it is possible that we either cannot detect a significant change in decay times, or we are missing a subset of ultra fast decay times. Regardless, these data not only suggest that the mechanisms controlling the rate of synaptic vesicle reacidification are not the same for spontaneous and stimulation-evoked vesicle fusion but that endocytosis of synaptic vesicles released at rest is rapid even during multivesicular fusion events, unlike retrieval of vesicles released in response to stimulation."

Next, we wanted to know if we see the same increase in our system. Surprisingly, we found no significant change in vesicle fusion frequency between 2 mM and 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (with 0.56 \u00b1 0.02 fusion events per min in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 0.49 \u00b1 0.02 fusion events per min in 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>; p value &gt;0.1) beyond the increase in multivesicular events we reported earlier (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We then counted all events with amplitudes within the first quantal mean as a single event, and events with larger amplitudes as two events (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Even with this criterion we did not detect a significant difference between 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (with 0.70 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.76 \u00b1 0.03 fusion events per min in 2 and 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respectively; p value &gt;0.1). However, when vesicle reacidification was buffered using 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) we were able to detect a slight shift in vesicle fusion rate in 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared to 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.42 \u00b1 0.02 fusion events per min in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 0.53 \u00b1 0.02 events per min in 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>; p value &lt;0.05). Addition of folimycin further exacerbated this effect and clearly showed a \u223c2.7-fold increase in spontaneous fusion rate as a function of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>; 0.41 \u00b1 0.02 events per min in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 1.1 \u00b1 0.02 events per min in 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>; p value &lt;0.05). This increase in spontaneous fusion rate comes close to the threefold to fourfold increase we detect using postsynaptic electrophysiological recordings under the same conditions (data not shown). Note that in both the Tris-buffered and folimycin-containing experiments, events were analyzed irrespective of amplitude. Taken together, these data indicate that increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases the vesicle fusion rate in our system in a manner that is detectable in the presence of folimycin. However, this increase in spontaneous fusion rate cannot be detected without increasing extracellular pH buffering or inhibiting vesicle re-acidification, indicating that elevated extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> specifically increases fusion of synaptic vesicles that are retrieved and re-acidified rapidly, below the temporal resolution of our imaging protocol. This finding suggests that although elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels do not alter the kinetics of slower events detectable without the aid of altered re-acidification, Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation generates a new population of events that are faster in their kinetics. This observation is consistent with earlier work, which demonstrated that increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> facilitates the propensity of vesicle retrieval events with fast kinetics (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ales et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wu et al., 2009</a>)."

In an earlier study, we employed the same approach to investigate trafficking of single synaptic vesicles that fuse in response to AP stimulation where the time of stimulation can be used to identify a successful fusion event (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</a>). For spontaneous vesicle fusion, however, such a time stamp does not exist; therefore, to confirm our findings using vGlut1-pHluorin, we also used dual color imaging with a red-shifted pHluorin variant (pHTomato) fused to the luminal domain of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin (SypHTomato) and a green Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive probe (GCaMP5K) fused to the post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95-GCaMP5K). In this setting, we could monitor presynaptic vesicle fusion and postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry upon NMDA receptor activation. We found that in both systems, synaptic vesicles that fuse spontaneously are retrieved and re-acidified much faster than their counterparts that fuse in response to stimulation. The rapid decay was not due to lateral diffusion of the probe because in the presence of folimycin, these events remained stable without decay and fluorescence accumulated in a stepwise fashion. It is also important to note that as these experiments were performed at room temperature, we expect that at higher, more physiological temperatures the rates of endocytosis and reacidification may be much faster than are reported here (<a href=\"#bib42\">Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007</a>). Additionally, we emphasize that the data presented here does not imply that the postsynaptic responses arising from spontaneous and evoked vesicle fusion are necessarily different. However, earlier work from our group (<a href=\"#bib6\">Atasoy et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sara et al., 2011</a>) does suggest there is a physical segregation of postsynaptic receptor activation patterns in response to evoked and spontaneous fusion events. Unfortunately, here we cannot measure evoked quantal postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during stimulation, as in our preparation, field stimulation itself causes direct postsynaptic effects. Therefore, in this study we did not examine the kinetic properties of evoked postsynaptic quantal events.

Taken together, these results indicate that spontaneous synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis are tightly coupled processes and that the decay phase of these transients was mainly due to vesicle re-acidification upon endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alabi and Tsien, 2012</a>). Although we see extremely fast endocytosis of spontaneous recycling vesicles, large probes such as antibodies against the luminal domain of synaptotagmin1 or horseradish peroxidase are known to label spontaneously endocytosing vesicles (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sara et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fredj and Burrone, 2009</a>). Therefore, spontaneously endocytosing vesicles may still form a fairly large fusion pore or may even fully collapse onto the plasma membrane\u2014albeit without lateral dispersion of their protein components\u2014despite being retrieved quickly. However, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that some spontaneous fusion events may form narrow fusion pores where uptake of large probes can be curtailed as seen after spontaneous fusion of peptidergic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vardjan et al., 2007</a>)."

First, our previous work has indicated that in response to increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations as well as in boutons with higher release probability the dwell time and the decay time of single vesicle fusion events increase (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</a>). Therefore, we believe it is critical to select boutons with a wide range of release probabilities for single vesicle analysis. Our current work extrapolates this observation to spontaneous release events where we detect events with even faster kinetics. The vesicle re-acidification rates we estimate, on the other hand, are in agreement with studies using synaptobrevin-pHluorin (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gandhi and Stevens, 2003</a>) as well as synaptophysin-pHluorin based measurements (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2009b</a>).

Finally, vesicles endocytosed during activity may rapidly trigger formation of larger vesicular structures that are expected to be slower to re-acidify due to their larger volume, consistent with findings from capacitance measurements in salamander photoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib51\">Van Hook and Thoreson, 2012</a>) as well as recent electronmicrographic analysis of endocytosis in hippocampal synapses after rapid high-pressure freeze fixation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>)."

At elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations we detected an increase in the amplitudes of fusion events consistent with exocytosis of multiple synaptic vesicles. As noted above, at our resolution we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed increase in amplitude could be due to vesicle fusion from multiple release sites within a region of interest, especially if elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations can activate adjacent release sites resulting in apparent multivesicular release albeit originating from two neighboring release sites. The discrepancy between the increases in mEPSC frequency we detect in electrophysiological recordings vs optical recordings of spontaneous events could indicate that some of the multivesicular events are occurring at neighboring synapses activated at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, our measurements of stimulation-evoked vesicle fusion probability at 2 mM Ca2+ are consistent with the dominance of single release sites in our analysis. Additionally, it is possible that increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> specifically promotes the spontaneous fusion of synaptic vesicles containing elevated copy number of vGlut-pHluorin endowed by either a larger physical size of the vesicle or an elevated intrinsic copy number of vGlut-pHluorin. However, in part due to the similarity between our results and the bursting activity observed previously using single-synapse recordings in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abenavoli et al., 2002</a>); we consider the increase in fluorescence amplitude as arising from the rapid successive fusion of multiple vesicles as the most cell biologically parsimonious. If this interpretation is correct, we also found that fluorescence signals originating from these multivesicular events were not slower in their rate of decay, which contrasts our earlier observations on evoked multivesicular fusion events (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</a>), indicating that spontaneous exocytic load (i.e. the number of spontaneously fused vesicles on the plasma membrane) does not significantly impact retrieval kinetics. Alternatively, even if the larger amplitude spontaneous events were due to the fusion of enlarged synaptic vesicles or synaptic vesicles containing more fluorophore, this interpretation would still imply that the size of synaptic vesicles or the number of vGlut-pHluorin molecules within a synaptic vesicle (more membrane or more cargo, that is the exocytic load) do not impact their retrieval kinetics at rest."

In all likelihood, at 8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> the average kinetics of fluorescence decay became faster due to emergence of events that could only be detected following inhibition of re-acidification. Therefore, with increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> there was a clear increase in the rate of spontaneous fusion and the number of vesicles that undergo fusion. The relative insensitivity of vesicle retrieval kinetics to Ca<sup>2+</sup> suggests that synaptic vesicle retrieval after spontaneous and evoked fusion is regulated via diverse mechanisms consistent with differential dependence of the two forms of endocytosis on distinct dynamin isoforms (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chung et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Raimondi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Meng et al., 2013</a>) and distinct postendocytic transport machineries (<a href=\"#bib36\">Peng et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "Finally, in our system we were able to directly compare the rate of spontaneous fusion and evoked-fusion probability within a single synapse. This analysis did not reveal a significant correlation between spontaneous fusion rate and evoked fusion probability estimates from individual release sites, further supporting the notion that these two modes of neurotransmission are controlled and maintained independently (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sara et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Atasoy et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fredj and Burrone, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Melom et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Peled et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2014</a> but see <a href=\"#bib18\">Groemer and Klingauf, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wilhelm et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations the propensity to fuse of each of the two forms of vesicle fusion was increased (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). However, consistent with their less steep dependence on Ca<sup>2+</sup>, spontaneous fusion events showed a milder 1.5\u20132-fold increase compared to the threefold increase detected in the propensity of evoked fusion events. Nevertheless, their lack of correlation persisted suggesting a divergence in the mechanisms that regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of evoked and spontaneous fusion events (<a href=\"#bib60\">Xu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Groffen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Pang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vyleta and Smith, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ermolyuk et al., 2013</a>). This difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of spontaneous and evoked fusion probability may underlie differential sensitivity of the two forms of neurotransmission of certain neuromodulators and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib37\">Peters et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ramirez and Kavalali, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bal et al., 2013</a>). Recent studies in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction have shown that a substantial fraction of release sites carry out exclusively spontaneous or evoked neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib35\">Peled et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Walter et al., 2014</a> also see ; <a href=\"#bib28\">Melom et al., 2013</a>). In our measurements, we detected a substantial overlap of release sites that are capable of both forms of neurotransmission, in agreement with our earlier estimates from lower temporal resolution experiments (<a href=\"#bib6\">Atasoy et al., 2008</a>). This discrepancy may be consistent with the premise that in immature presynaptic release sites, spontaneous neurotransmission dominates and release gradually shifts towards evoked transmission during synapse maturation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Polo-Parada et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mozhayeva et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Andreae et al., 2012</a> also <a href=\"#bib54\">Walter et al., 2014</a>). Taken together, the findings we present here provide insight into the segregation of spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release mechanisms at the level of single synaptic vesicle fusion events. The differential regulation of spontaneous vesicle fusion suggests it has a role in neuronal signaling distinct from information transfer patterns mediated by evoked release, even within a single synapse."

DU-897U-CSO-#BV) collected on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope with a 100X Plan Fluor objective (Nikon). For illumination we used a Lambda-DG4 (Sutter instruments, Novato, CA) with FITC filter. Images were acquired at \u223c8 Hz with an exposure time of 100 ms and binning 4 (Using Nikon Elements Ar software). For analysis, square regions of interest (ROIs) with length and width of 2.5 \u03bcm were generated and the resulting fluorescence values were exported to Microsoft Excel for analysis. Successful fusion events were those where the average of 3 points was greater than twice the standard deviation of 17 points (\u223c2.1 s) prior provided the recordings were stable for at least 78 frames (\u223c10 s) preceding the increase in fluorescence. Additionally, at least one additional point after the initial fluorescence increase had to be greater than twice the standard deviation of the 17 points prior; this excluded large single point increases in fluorescence from which decay times could not be determined. Noise measurements were obtained in an analogous fashion: by subtracting the average of 3 points from the mean of 17 points prior during a random period during sampling. Decay times were analyzed in Clampfit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) by fitting raw data with a single exponential decay using Levenberg\u2013Marquardt least sum of squares minimizations. For all control experiments, the extracellular solution was a modified Tyrode's solution containing (in mM): 150 NaCl, 4 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl and varying concentrations of CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2, 4, and 8 mM), pH 7.4 (310 Osm). In experiments with folimycin (Concanamycin A, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), a final concentration of 80 nM was used. For Tris-buffered experiments, solutions contained (in mM): 108 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose and 50 Tris\u2013HCl and 2 or 8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. For all Tris buffering experiments, neurons were allowed to equilibrate in extracellular solution for at least 10 min prior to imaging. We elected to use a Tris-buffered extracellular solution because it does not require continuous bubbling during perfusion; a prerequisite of bicarbonate based buffers. Moreover, it has been shown that incubation in Tris can buffer, and thus slow, vesicle reacidification (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gandhi and Stevens, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zhang et al., 2009a</a>). All solutions were adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH and 310 Osm prior to use. To prevent network activity, postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX 10 \u03bcM; Sigma) and D(\u2212)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5 50 \u03bcM; Sigma) were added to the experimental solutions. To prevent spontaneous action potential generation, we incubated neurons in 1 \u00b5M tetrodotoxin (TTX). For simultaneous spontaneous activity and evoked stimulation experiments, TTX was omitted from the extracellular solution and neurons were stimulated using parallel bipolar electrodes (FHC) delivering 15\u201320 mA pulses with pulse width of 1 ms. At the end of each experiment, Tyrode containing 20 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl was added to help identify putative synaptic boutons. Due to the lower intrinsic release probability in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we gave twice as many stimulations (20 APs delivered 15 s apart) as in 4 and 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (10 APs delivered 30 s apart), thus evoked fusion probability estimates in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> are in multiples of 0.05 and not 0.1."

The extracellular solution was the same as above, however 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX 10 \u03bcM; Tocris, UK) was used instead of CNQX as it is a more specific AMPAR antagonist. AP-5 and Mg<sup>2+</sup> were omitted from all experiments to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through NMDARs. Full waveforms of sypHTomato and GCaMP5K fluorescence were fit with a double exponential decay time and linearized to correct for photobleaching. Corrected fluorescence waveforms were analyzed as above for fluorescence increases. Once fusion events were identified, the raw data at that time was linearly corrected according to the baseline slope from 15 s before the event. This method proved successful as in the absence of folimycin events would decay back to baseline but in the presence of folimcyin the events had a staircase fluorescence waveform.

The authors in principle address this point elegantly by co-expressing a fluorescence calcium-indicator (GCaMP5K) fused to PSD-95 and doing dual-color imaging. This is a nice approach, but from the text and analysis presented it does not become clear whether there was a tight correlation between pre- and post-synaptic events, and therefore there is not enough evidence for the conclusion: \u201c...spontaneous fusing vesicles elicit postsynaptic Ca2+ signals\u201d. For instance in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>: are those events (red and green channel) detected simultaneously? How often did spontaneous increases in the red channel correlate with increases in the green channel? How many events in the red channel did not coincide with events in the green channel? The authors could calculate and plot the waiting times between sequential red and green events at identified synapses. If the authors are right, such a plot should have a peak at very short intervals. Finally, the authors write \u201cSpontaneous increases in fluorescence that were correlated (within {plus minus} 1 s) with Ca2+ signals..\u201d I do not understand the {plus minus} here: presumably the relevant events would be those were the red event would precede (or coincide with) the green event, not the other way around.

The larger events in the presence of higher calcium concentration could be because of the preferential fusion of slightly larger vesicles under these circumstances (or even due to a change in the photophysical properties of pHluorin). The author's argument doesn't make sense to me: \u201cIt is unlikely that this increase in fluorescence is due to variation in the number of pHluorin molecules, as the increase in amplitude is observed when extracellular Ca2+ concentrations are increased.\u201d Why not? The histogram of event sizes could not be fitted with a single Gaussian, but who is to say whether spontaneously fusing vesicles exactly follow a Gaussian distribution? The three distributions at 1q, 1.3q and 2q are not visible as peaks in the histogram at all; especially the fit of a distribution at 2q appears unreasonable. Finally, the suggestion that events with normalized amplitude at 1.3 q would result from multivesicular release of two vesicles with a fixed delay (118 ms) appears unreasonable; what mechanism would ensure that multivesicular release would happen always with this delay, especially as this is spontaneous release? I think the authors should remove this interpretation, which has consequences also for the interpretation of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and for the rates reported in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and possibly in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>."
