This subdivision insulates genes and/or regulatory elements within a domain from promiscuous interactions with nearby domains. While it was previously assumed that the chromosomal domain landscape is fixed, there is now growing evidence that the landscape may be subject to tissue and stage specific regulation. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel developmentally restricted boundary factor, Elba. We show that Elba is an unusual hetero-tripartite protein complex that requires all three proteins for DNA binding and insulator activity."

This subdivision insulates genes and/or regulatory elements within a domain from promiscuous interactions with nearby domains. While it was previously assumed that the chromosomal domain landscape is fixed, there is now growing evidence that the landscape may be subject to tissue and stage specific regulation. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel developmentally restricted boundary factor, Elba. We show that Elba is an unusual hetero-tripartite protein complex that requires all three proteins for DNA binding and insulator activity."

The answer is that the compact structure of chromatin relaxes and opens up, which allows the DNA to be transcribed into messenger RNA. Indeed, packing DNA into chromatin makes this process more reliable, thus ensuring that the cell only produces proteins and other gene products when it needs them. However, because cross-talk between neighboring genes could potentially disrupt or change gene expression patterns, cells evolved special elements called boundaries or insulators to stop this from happening. These elements subdivide eukaryotic chromosomes into functionally autonomous chromatin domains."

While Elba2 is present during most stages of development, the other two Elba proteins are only present during early embryonic development, so the boundary factor is only active in early embryos. In addition to revealing a new mechanism for controlling boundary activity as an organism develops, the studies of Aoki et al. provide further evidence that chromatin domains can be dynamic."

Boundaries define units of independent genetic activity by shielding genes and/or regulatory elements within a domain from adventitious interactions with regulatory elements/genes in nearby domains. The specific functions that can be ascribed to most boundary elements include an enhancer-blocking or insulator activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Holdridge and Dorsett, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kellum and Schedl, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chung et al., 1993</a>), a silencer-blocking or barrier activity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kellum and Schedl, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chung et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Burgess\u2013Beusse et al., 2002</a>) and, when combined in specific pairwise combinations an ability to bring distant chromosomal DNA segments in close proximity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai and Shen, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Muravyova et al., 2001</a>). Boundary elements have a diverse array of functions. In the yeast <i>S. pombe</i>, boundaries help restrict and maintain the heterochromatin state of the silenced mating type locus (<a href=\"#bib39\">Noma et al., 2001</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, boundary elements play a critical role in the Bithorax complex (BX-C), helping to ensure that the three BX-C homeotic genes properly specify segmental identity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Maeda and Karch, 2006</a>). In vertebrates, boundaries have been implicated in controlling the expression of mRNAs encoding different neuronal Protocadherin-alpha isoforms and in regulating recombination and expression of immunoglobulin light and heavy chain genes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ribeiro de Almeida et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Monahan et al., 2012</a>)."

Moreover, the proteins conferring insulating activity in flies and vertebrates like Su(Hw), BEAF, Zw5, GAGA factor and CTCF are ubiquitously expressed and seemingly functional in all cell types. This led to the idea that boundaries are static structures and consequently that the regulatory domain landscape of eukaryotic chromosomes is largely invariant from one cell to the next. However recent studies argue that the domain landscape is more dynamic than previously imagined and that genes can be differentially regulated during normal development and differentiation and in the progression of disease states like cancer by redefining their domain organization (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bell and Felsenfeld, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Witcher and Emerson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gomes and Espinosa, 2010</a>). For example, regulation of the imprinted <i>Igf2</i> and <i>H19</i> genes pivots on parent of origin differences in the DNA methylation pattern and consequently the activity of a CTCF-dependent boundary element upstream of the <i>H19</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bell and Felsenfeld, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hark et al., 2000</a>). In this and also other examples, regulatory domains are defined or redefined locally by modulating how a ubiquitous insulator protein functions at a specific boundary element. However, one mechanism for defining domains that has yet to be described are developmental stage or cell type specific changes in the available repertoire of boundary proteins."

BX-C spans \u223c300 kb and includes three Hox-family genes <i>Ultrabithorax</i>, <i>abdominal-A</i> and <i>Abdominal-B</i>. Parasegment specific expression of these three homeotic genes is generated by a series of functionally autonomous <i>cis</i>-regulatory domains: <i>abx</i>/<i>bx</i>, <i>bxd</i>/<i>pbx</i> and <i>iab-2</i>-<i>iab8, 9</i>. Functionally autonomy depends upon boundary elements that lie between each <i>cis</i>-regulatory domain (<a href=\"#bib34\">Maeda and Karch, 2010</a>). One of these boundary elements is <i>Fab-7</i>, which is located in between the <i>iab-6</i> and <i>iab-7 cis</i>-regulatory domains. Both in the context of BX-C and in transgene assays, the <i>Fab-7</i> boundary can block the action of enhancers/silencers at all stages of development, apparently irrespective of tissue or cell type (<a href=\"#bib12\">Galloni et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hagstrom et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mihaly et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schweinsberg et al., 2004</a>). (<b>B</b>) The <i>Fab-7</i> boundary spans a sequence of 1.2 kb and consists of two prominent and one minor (*) chromatin specific nuclease hypersensitive regions (shown as yellow boxes). There is a third prominent nuclease hypersensitive region (blue) just distal to the boundary, which corresponds to a Polycomb Response Element (PRE) for the <i>iab-7 cis</i>-regulatory domain (<a href=\"#bib34\">Maeda and Karch, 2010</a>). The orange box is a \u223c100 base pair (bp) high-homology region which is conserved among <i>Drosophila</i> species (&gt;90%) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2008</a>). The ovals are binding sites for Trithorax-like (GAGA factor). (<b>C</b>) pHS1 is a 236-bp fragment from the proximal side of HS1 which has enhancer-blocking activity only in early embryos (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schweinsberg and Schedl, 2004</a>). pHS1 includes the high-homology region and two GAGA-binding sites. These two GAGA sites are important for the early boundary activity of <i>Fab-7</i>, while GAGA sites elsewhere in <i>Fab-7</i> are needed later in development (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schweinsberg et al., 2004</a>). In addition to the GAGA sites, the enhancer-blocking activity of pHS1 in early embryos also depends upon an 8-bp sequence, CCAATAAG, called Elba (Early boundary activity). Mutations in this sequence compromise the blocking activity of a 4\u00d7pHS1 multimer, while multimerization of a 27-bp oligo spanning the Elba sequence (8\u00d7Elba) [see (<b>D</b>)] is sufficient to confer early blocking activity. The Elba sequence is recognized by the stage-specific Elba DNA-binding factor. Elba factor binding is detected in 0\u20136 hr nuclear extracts, but it is absent in 6\u201312 hr (and 6\u201318 hr) nuclear extracts (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2008</a>).

In older embryos (stage 13\u201314) the NE enhancer drives LacZ expression in the CNS. (<b>B</b>) When <i>Fab-7</i> is place between the <i>ftz</i> enhancers and the reporter, it blocks both enhancers from activating the <i>hsp70</i> promoter and there is little if any LacZ expression in either early or late embryos. (<b>C</b>) When pHS1\u00d74 (four copies of the 236-bp pHS1: see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) is placed between the enhancers and the reporter, it blocks the UPS enhancer from activating stripe expression. However, boundary activity is stage specific and pHS1\u00d74 does not block the NE from activating LacZ expression in the CNS in older embryos (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2008</a>). (<b>D</b>) When mutations (M3 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) that disrupt Elba binding in nuclear extracts are introduced into the Elba sequence of pHS1, the enhancer blocking activity of the mutated pHS1\u00d74 is compromised.

(<b>E</b>) When a 27-bp oligo containing the Elba binding sequence is multimerized (Elba\u00d78) and placed in between the <i>ftz</i> enhancers and the reporter, it blocks UPS driven LacZ stripe expression. It also causes a reduction in the extent of NE activation. This effect is position dependent. The blocking activity seen at this stage with the 8\u00d7 multimer is likely due to the presence of some residual Elba activity in older embryos as seen in EMSA experiments with 6\u201312 hr nuclear extracts (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2008</a>)."

The first evidence for this developmental restriction came from the effects of mutations in binding sites for the GAGA factor in enhancer blocking assays (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schweinsberg et al., 2004</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, there are three pairs of GAGA sites in HS1. Mutations in the proximal pair weaken boundary activity in early embryos, but have little effect from mid-embryogenesis onwards. In contrast, mutations in the central pair weaken boundary activity during mid-embryogenesis and in adults, but not in early embryos. Further evidence for sub-elements with developmentally restricted boundary activity came from experiments in which small fragments from HS1 were multimerized. Multimers of small 2- to 400-bp fragments from the distal half of HS1 were found to block enhancer-promoter interactions from mid-embryogenesis onwards even more efficiently that the intact <i>Fab-7</i> boundary. However, these fragments have less blocking activity than <i>Fab-7</i> in early embryos. Conversely, a multimerized 236-bp fragment, pHS1, containing the proximal pair of GAGA sites has enhancer blocking activity during early embryogenesis, but not thereafter. This is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> which shows that pHS1\u00d74 blocks the <i>fushi tarazu</i> (<i>ftz</i>) UPS stripe enhancer in early embryos, but doesn't block the <i>ftz</i> NE enhancer during mid-embryogenesis. Consistent with these transgene results, two partial <i>Fab-7</i> deletions in BX-C that remove the distal half of HS1 plus H2, but retain the proximal pHS1 sequence including pair of GAGA sites function as boundaries during early embryogenesis but not later in development (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schweinsberg and Schedl, 2004</a>). In addition, the early boundary activity of these partial deletions depends upon the GAGA factor (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schweinsberg et al., 2004</a>)."

Only one DNA binding activity, Elba, had a stage-specificity consistent with the insulating activity of pHS1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2008</a>). It is present in extracts from early 0\u20136 hr embryos, a period when pHS1 boundary activity is high. In contrast, in extracts from older 6\u201312 hr embryos, where pHS1 boundary activity in vivo is largely absent, only little Elba is detected. Elba recognizes an asymmetric 8-bp sequence, CCAATAAG (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), which is conserved in the <i>Fab-7</i> elements of other <i>Drosophila</i> species including the distant <i>melanogaster</i> relative <i>D. virilis</i>. Moreover, two lines of evidence indicate that the Elba factor is important for boundary activity in early embryos. We found that mutations in the recognition sequence that disrupt Elba binding in nuclear extracts compromise pHS1 insulator activity in vivo. Conversely, multimerizing the Elba recognition sequence is sufficient to confer early insulating activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2008</a>; see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We describe here a general cross-affinity purification strategy for identifying components of multi-protein DNA binding complexes by mass spectrometry. Using this purification strategy, we show that the Elba boundary factor is an unusual hetero-tripartite protein complex. Two of the proteins, Elba1 and Elba2, share a conserved C-terminal \u2018BEN domain\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abhiman et al., 2008</a>). The third protein, Elba3, has no obvious conserved protein domains, but is encoded by a gene that is closely linked to Elba1. All three Elba proteins are required to reconstitute DNA binding activity in vitro. DNA binding depends upon the BEN domains in Elba1 and Elba2, while Elba3 mediates the assembly of an active Elba complex by interacting with the N-terminal domains of Elba1 and Elba2. All three Elba proteins are present in the Elba complex detected in 0\u20136 hr nuclear extracts and all three are required for chromatin domain boundary function in vivo. Finally, because <i>elba1</i> and <i>elba3</i> are \u2018mid-blastula transition\u2019 genes, Elba only binds to its' target sequences in <i>Fab-7</i> and confers insulator activity during early embryogenesis."

Following S-Sepharose chromatography, the active fraction was split into two aliquots and fractionated on either wild type (WT) or mutant (M) DNA affinity beads.

First, all three are \u223c40 kDa, which is close in size to the protein species in nuclear extracts that is UV cross-linked to probes containing the Elba sequence (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2008</a>). Second, the C-terminal \u223c130 amino acids of Elba1 and Elba2 show extensive sequence similarities (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Moreover, included within this region of similarity is a conserved \u223c90 amino acids BEN domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) that has been implicated in protein:protein interactions and transcriptional regulation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cha et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mackler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Korutla et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Duan et al., 2011</a>). Two other fly proteins have BEN domains. One is a predicted isoform of the Mod(mdg4)C boundary factor, while the other is Insensitive (Insv) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), which functions in neurogenesis and Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib10\">Duan et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, the <i>elba2</i> and <i>Insv</i> transcription units are paired with each other (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Mammals have a large family of BEND proteins. Of the mammalian proteins, Elba1 is most closely related to BEND7, while Elba2 is most closely related to BEND6 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The BEN domain of Insv is most closely related to BEN9/hNAC2 and BEND8/hNAC1. Finally, though Elba3 differs from Elba1 and Elba2 in that it has no distinctive domains, its transcription unit is located next to <i>elba1</i> (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) just like the <i>elba2</i> and <i>insv</i> pair."

Consistent with the idea that only the heterodimer is able to bind to the Elba probe, we found that there is little DNA binding activity when the two GST fusions are translated independently and then mixed together just before assaying (not shown). In this case, DNA binding activity is likely limited by a slow rate of dissociation of the GST-ElbaF homodimers. The fact that a heterologous dimerization domain can support what appears to be near full DNA binding activity would be consistent with the idea that the role of Elba3 is to link Elba1 and Elba2 together (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

As expected from the experiments described above, the N-terminal halves of Elba1 and Elba2 had no DNA binding activity either with (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) or without the GST moiety. For the C-terminal halves of Elba1 and Elba2 we first generated cDNAs that span the entire 130 amino acids homology region (including the 90 amino acids BEN domain) either with or without the N-terminal GST (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Like the full-length GST fusions, the GST-ElbaC homodimers have no detectable DNA binding activity on their own (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lanes 14 and 15), while a very prominent shift is generated when the RNAs encoding GST-Elba1C and GST-Elba2C are co-translated (lane 13). In addition to having roughly equivalent activity to the \u2018native\u2019 hetero-tripartite Elba complex generated by the three full length Elba proteins, the GST-Elba1C:GST-Elba2C heterodimer exhibits a similar sequence specificity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6C</a>). The two ElbaC proteins also resemble the corresponding full-length Elba1 and Elba2 proteins in that full DNA binding activity requires the dimerization activity of the GST (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lanes 13 16). On the other hand, the two ElbaC proteins differ from the full length Elba1 and Elba2 proteins in two respects. Most importantly, the addition of Elba3 to the two ElbaC proteins (without the GST moiety) does not reconstitute full DNA binding activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, lane 7). This finding suggests that Elba3 orchestrates the formation of the hetero-tripartite complex by interacting with sequences in the N-terminal domains of Elba1 and Elba2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Consistent with this idea, the shift generated by the active GST-Elba1C:GST-Elba2C heterodimer differs from the full-length heterodimer in that it is not supershifted by the addition of Elba3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lane 12). A second potentially interesting difference is that the mixture of Elba1C and Elba2C proteins (lacking GST) gives a faint shift that can be detected in long (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, lane 8 filled arrowhead) but not short (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lane 16) exposures. Like the shift generated by the corresponding GST proteins, this shift is not enhanced or supershifted by the addition of Elba3 (lane 7) and it requires both proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, lanes 9 and 10). Interestingly, it can be stabilized as well as supershifted by the addition of FLAG antibodies (but not GST antibodies: lanes 11 and 12). Although further studies will be required, it would appear that there are weakly active hetero-dimerization motifs in the C-terminal halves of Elba1 and Elba2 that become more readily accessible when the N-terminus of the two proteins is removed."

It is possible that the close proximity of the GST moiety in these proteins precludes formation of a dimer that can form a stable DNA\u2013protein complex. Alternatively, sequences in the extended 130 amino acid homology region might be important in facilitating DNA binding (e.g., aligning the two BEN domains)."

As all three proteins co-migrate with yolk protein they are difficult to visualize or quantitate by Western blots. For this reason we used Northerns to examine the expression of the three <i>elba</i> genes during development. These experiments indicate that the DNA binding/boundary activity of the Elba factor is developmentally restricted because of the temporal expression patterns of the paired <i>elba1</i> and <i>elba3</i> genes. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> show that neither is expressed during oogenesis, and that their mRNAs are largely absent in 0\u20132 hr embryos. Consistent with the previous identification of <i>elba1</i> as a mid-blastula transition gene (<a href=\"#bib44\">Singer and Lengyel, 1997</a>), expression of <i>elba1</i> and also <i>elba3</i> peaks at the blastoderm stage (2\u20134 hr), and then disappears. The disappearance of the <i>elba1</i> and <i>elba3</i> mRNAs occurs in the same time frame as the loss of boundary activity in transgene embryos and DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts. In much older embryos <i>elba3</i> mRNAs are detected, but are present at a lower level than in the blastoderm stage (see also <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While expression of <i>elba1</i> and <i>elba3</i> is developmentally restricted, <i>elba2</i> and its neighboring ortholog, <i>insv</i>, appear to be expressed throughout much embryogenesis. Moreover, both are expressed during oogenesis and likely are maternally deposited, as high levels are present in 0\u20132 hr embryo before zygotic transcription is activated."

A functional hetero-tripartite Elba factor would be assembled in early embryos and would bind to boundary elements containing the Elba recognition sequence (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Later in development, after the <i>elba1</i> and <i>elba3</i> mRNAs disappear, the hetero-tripartite Elba factor would disappear as well. In this case, Elba2 wouldn't be able to bind to boundaries containing the Elba recognition sequence on its own. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of staged 2\u20135 hr and 9\u201312 hr embryos to test this model. As standard formaldehyde based ChIP protocols gave inconsistent enrichment of <i>Fab-7</i> sequences, we adapted the cross-linking procedure of <a href=\"#bib40\">Nowak et al.

In contrast, neither protein appears to be bound to <i>Fab-7</i> in 9\u201312 hr embryos. These findings dovetail nicely with the developmental profiles of Elba blocking activity in transgene assays and Elba binding activity in nuclear extracts. In addition, even though <i>elba2</i> is expressed in 9\u201312 hr embryos, the Elba2 protein isn't found associated with the <i>Fab-7</i> Elba sequence in the absence of the two other Elba proteins."

Consequently, the activity of the intact <i>Fab-7</i> boundary in the context of BX-C or in transgene assays is not expected to be disrupted by knocking down the Elba factor or even by mutations in the Elba binding site. On the other hand, unlike the intact boundary, Elba seems to play a more critical role in the insulating activity of the pHS1 multimer (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al. 2008</a>). For this reason, we injected double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific for each Elba protein into embryos transgenic for the pHS1\u00d74 pCfhl boundary reporter.

Similar results were obtained in two other sets of pHS1\u00d74 dsRNA injection experiments, and in experiments using embryos transgenic for the Elba multimer (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Like the set shown here, the disruption of boundary activity in these experiments was greatest for <i>elba1</i> and <i>elba3</i>, while smaller effects were observed for <i>elba2</i>. The differences in expression pattern of the <i>elba</i> mRNAs most likely accounts for this differences in sensitivity to dsRNA. While expression of <i>elba1</i> and <i>elba3</i> would be turned on in most instances after injection of the dsRNA, there is a substantial pool of maternally derived <i>elba2</i> mRNAs that could already be translationally engaged at the time of injection.

Here we report the identification and characterization of a factor, Elba, which confers the insulator activity of one of these sub-elements in early embryos. Elba is an unusual hetero-tripartite complex. It consists of two \u223c40 kDa proteins, Elba1 and Elba2, that have a C-terminal 90 amino acid BEN domain embedded in a larger 130 amino acid region of homology. The BEN domain is found in insect and vertebrate nuclear proteins and has been implicated in protein:protein interactions and transcriptional regulation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abhiman et al., 2008</a>). The third protein, Elba3 has no distinctive domains and seems to be limited to the Drosophilids.

In the tripartite Elba complex, this seems to be the role of Elba3. It brings Elba1 and Elba2 together by interacting with sequences in the N-terminal half of the two proteins. These conclusions are supported by a number of findings. First, it is possible to circumvent the requirement for Elba3 by fusing a heterologous dimerization domain, in this case GST, to the N-terminus of full length Elba1 and Elba2. When co-translated, these two fusion proteins shift the Elba probe without Elba3. On the other hand, they can still interact with Elba3 as the shift generated by the two proteins can be supershifted by the addition of Elba3. Second, the Elba1C and Elba2C proteins, which span the 130 amino acid C-terminal homology region, can reconstitute full DNA binding activity when fused to GST. Since GST is known to dimerize, but not form higher order complexes, this would argue that the Elba DNA binding pocket is likely formed by a GST-Elba1C:GST-Elba2C dimer rather than by some other more complicated combination of the two proteins. Moreover, this binary complex has the same sequence specificity as the native hetero-tripartite complex. On the other hand, the GST-Elba1C:GST-Elba2C proteins differ from the full length GST fusions in that they don't interact with Elba3."

For one, though our experiments indicate that the BEN domain is essential for DNA binding, we were unable to demonstrate that it is sufficient. It is possible that steric hindrance from the closely linked GST moiety prevents formation of the DNA binding pocket; alternatively, the extended homology region may contain elements that are important for DNA binding. Another apparent anomaly is that the homodimers formed by the full length or the C-terminal GST fusions don't appear to bind to the Elba probe. Since we've found that the Elba factor can bind to variants of the Elba sequence, albeit with reduced affinity, we would have expected that the homodimers would exhibit at least some evidence of DNA binding activity. Further studies will be required to resolve these issues."

However, several lines of evidence argue that Elba does in fact have such a function for the endogenous <i>Fab-7</i> boundary. To begin with, previous studies showed that the insulating activity of the 236-bp pHS1 <i>Fab-7</i> sub-element in early embryos is compromised when the Elba recognition sequence is mutated. Moreover, when multimerized, the Elba sequence is sufficient on its own to confer insulating activity. That the Elba factor is responsible for this insulating activity is supported by the effects of RNAi knockdowns in embryos carrying either the pHS1\u00d74 transgene or the Elba sequence multimer. For all three Elba proteins, RNAi knockdowns compromises the insulating activity of both pHS1\u00d74 and the Elba multimer. In contrast, knockdowns of the closely related BEN domain protein, Insv, have no effect."

However, it should gradually dissipate after transcription of <i>elba1</i> and <i>elba3</i> ceases. While we don't know precisely when Elba1 and Elba3 disappear, there is little Elba DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts of 6\u201312 hr embryos.

                        "text": "One important question is why does a constitutive insulator like <i>Fab-7</i> utilized developmentally limited factors like Elba? A plausible explanation comes from the finding that boundaries are not autonomous entities, but rather function in combination (likely pairwise) with other boundaries (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai and Shen, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Muravyova et al., 2001</a>). Both boundary competition (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gohl et al., 2011</a>) and boundary bypass experiments (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kyrchanova et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Maksimenko et al., 2008</a>) indicate that some combinations are functional while others are not. Moreover, how different boundary combinations work together depends upon developmental stage and tissue (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gohl et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the use of stage specific factors at <i>Fab-7</i> could reflect a need to optimize combinations with other nearby BX-C boundaries or the Abdominal-B promoter (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kyrchanova et al., 2008b</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2011</a>). A number of findings are consistent with this idea. When heterologous boundaries are used to replace <i>Fab-7</i> in BX-C, they are unable to provide bypass activity, while their insulating activity can be lost in a stage and tissue specific fashion (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hogga et al., 2001</a>). In contrast, <i>Fab-7</i> is able to replace <i>Fab-8</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Iampietro et al., 2008</a>). Likewise, the boundary activity of <i>Fab-7</i> in a foreign environment is not only context dependent, but also varies during development (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gohl et al., 2011</a>). Probably the most direct evidence that boundaries in BX-C like <i>Fab-7</i> are closely matched with their flanking neighbors comes from the boundary bypass experiments of <a href=\"#bib31\">Kyrchanova et al. (2011)</a>. They found that bypass is observed when <i>Fab-7</i> is combined with the neighboring boundaries <i>Fab-6</i> and <i>Fab-8</i>, while bypass interactions with boundaries from elsewhere in BX-C are only weak at best. Interestingly, in the cases that have been analyzed most thoroughly, boundary bypass is mediated by homologous protein:protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kyrchanova et al., 2008a</a>). Thus, bypass is observed when multimerized binding sites for the dCTCF boundary factor are paired, but not when dCTCF binding sites are paired with sites for example Zw5. Though <i>Fab-8</i> differs from <i>Fab-7</i> in that it utilizes dCTCF (<a href=\"#bib22\">Holohan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kyrchanova et al., 2011</a>), EMSA experiments with 0\u20136 hr and 6\u201312 hr nuclear extracts indicate that they also have binding sites for several of the same stage specific factors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2008</a>; Wolle et al., unpublished data). These include sites for the Elba factor, and sites for two different late (6\u201312 hr) stage specific factors. Conceivably this could also be true for <i>Fab-6</i>."

While Elba2 can't bind to the Elba sequence on its own, it could function as an insulator in other contexts using different protein partners and presumably also recognition sequences. A plausible partner would be the <i>Notch</i> signaling pathway protein Insv, which is encoded by a tightly linked gene that has a similar expression pattern to <i>elba2</i>. Insv and its closest mammalian relatives, the NAC proteins (which are thought to function as stem cell pluripotency genes, as well as in cocaine addiction and cancer), are believed to regulate transcription by acting as co-repressors (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cha et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mackler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Korutla et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Duan et al., 2011</a>). However, since our findings indicate that the BEN domains of Elba1 and Elba2 are essential for DNA binding, it would be reasonable to suppose that Insv as well as the mammalian counterparts are not co-repressors, but are rather sequence specific DNA binding proteins. Interestingly, like members of the BEN domain protein family, CTCF was initially thought to be a transcriptional repressor (<a href=\"#bib11\">Filippova et al., 1996</a>). Thus, a seemingly plausible speculation would be that other members of the BEN family besides the two Elba proteins function as insulators restricting the action of nearby enhancer elements instead of directly repressing transcription. Potentially supporting this idea is the finding that one of the mammalian BEN domain proteins, SMAR1, is a component of the nuclear matrix and associates with Matrix Attachment Regions (MARS) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chattopadhyay et al., 2000</a>). If this were the case, this would mean that CTCF is not the only vertebrate insulator protein. Also as is case for the Elba complex, modulating the expression or activity of Elba2, Insv or NAC1 in different tissues or cell types could change the regulatory domain landscapes, and potentially alter global patterns of gene expression."

First, there were too many candidate proteins making identification of the Elba factor impractical. Second, the large number of proteins in ME1 suggested that there was significant amount of non-specific binding to the affinity beads. Third, the ME1 sample contained a small amount of Elba activity raising the possibility that the Elba factor was included in the list of proteins detected by mass spectrometry in both the WE1 and ME1 samples. To address these problems, we needed a procedure that would substantially reduce the number of non-specific proteins and at the same time give much greater differences in Elba yield from wild type and mutant affinity beads. For this purpose we used a cross affinity purification scheme (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The sample from S-Sepharose fractionation was divided into two parts (about 6 ml each) and incubated with wild type or mutant DNA affinity beads (60 \u03bcl each) as described above. The unbound supernatant from the wild type (WS) and the mutant (MS) affinity beads was recovered and used for cross affinity purification. The WS fraction was incubated with mutant DNA affinity beads (33 \u03bcl) while the MS fraction was incubated with wild type DNA affinity beads. The beads were washed with buffer containing increasing amounts of KCl and then eluted with 1.0 M KCl. The difference in Elba activity between wild type (MSW1) and mutant (WSM1) 1.0 M KCl fractions became much greater for the cross-affinity purified samples than it was for the corresponding 1.0 M fractions from the single step samples (WE1 and ME1). Additionally, there was also a substantial reduction in the total number of proteins in the MSW1 and WSM1 fractions compared to the single affinity WE1 and ME1 fractions from the first and second experiments."

The upstream PCR primers included a Bam HI site, whereas the downstream PCR primers had either Sal I or Xho I sites. In the case of the Elba1 cDNA, which has an internal Bam HI site, the full coding sequence was amplified using a 5\u2032 PCR primer that had a Bam H1 site and 3\u2032 primer that had a Sal I site. The PCR product was digested with Bam H1 and introduced into pET28c. The resulting plasmid was digested with Hind III (which cuts in the Elba1 cDNA) and Xho I (which cuts in the vector). It was then ligated to the Hind III-Sal I fragment generated by digestion of the full length Elba1 PCR product. The plasmids for 6\u00d7His-HA-tagged proteins were constructed using a two-step procedure.

Two of these polypeptides, Elba1 and Elba2, harbor a C-terminal BEN domain. The third polypeptide, Elba3, does not contain any conserved motifs. Beyond the biochemical scheme used to isolate the Elba complex, most of the data presented in the article are convincing gel shift experiments that bring insights into the mechanism of binding of the tripartite complex. In brief, Elba3 plays the role of an adaptor protein, bringing Elba1 and 2 together, thereby establishing a complex that recognizes the asymmetric sequence motif through the BEN domains of Elba1 and 2. It is interesting to note here that only the complex containing all three polypeptides can bind to the recognition site and that the different binary combinations of the subunits do not exhibit distinct binding to the Fab-7 target site. The genomic organization of the genes encoding Elba1-3 is intriguing. Indeed the <i>elba2</i> gene is found in the immediate vicinity of another BEN domain protein, Insensitive (Insv), involved in neurogenesis and Notch signaling. The <i>elba1</i> gene corresponds to a locus previously described by Judy Lengyel's laboratory as Bsg25A, based on its short expression window during embryonic development, at blastoderm stage (Bsg stands for Blastoderm-specific-gene)."

In addition to their close proximity, the <i>elba1</i> and <i>elba3</i> genes share the striking feature of being expressed during a very short and specific time window in early development at the blastoderm stage. This tight and specific regulation of <i>elba1</i> and <i>elba3</i> is in perfect agreement with the previous characterization of the Elba activity by Aoki et al. (2008) and represent a strong argument that the factors purified biochemically indeed correspond to the original Elba activity."

Unfortunately such mutants are not available and their generation is beyond the scope of this article. The authors nevertheless perform the difficult experiment of injecting embryos carrying their ftz-lac Z based insulator construct with double strand RNAs targeted at inactivating <i>elba1</i>, <i>elba2</i> or <i>elba3</i>. While the quality of the embryos that are depicted in Figure 10 is not optimal (probably reflecting the fact that they have to be injected and are thus limited in numbers), this last experiment nevertheless supports the idea that depleting <i>elba1</i>, <i>elba2,</i> or <i>elba3</i> interferes with the early enhancer-blocking activity of Fab-7."

Typically concerns about off-target effects are addressed using a 2<sup>nd</sup> dsRNA and showing that it has the same effect as the original. The supposition in this case is that if there are off-targets for the two dsRNAs, they will be different. We would argue that the finding that three independent dsRNAs, each targeting a different <i>elba</i> gene, disrupt boundary activity, while no effects are observed for the related gene <i>insv</i>, provides a much more rigorous demonstration of specificity, and more compelling evidence that the Elba factor is responsible for boundary activity, than would typically be provided in papers in which the authors use a second dsRNA to demonstrate that a specific gene/factor is required for a particular process. As for measuring the extent of depletion, this would be a very difficult experiment in the context of embryo injections and, importantly, would add little to the conclusions we draw from these experiments."
