                    "text": "The development and morphology of vascular plants is critically determined by synthesis and proper distribution of the phytohormone auxin. The directed cell-to-cell distribution of auxin is achieved through a system of auxin influx and efflux transporters. PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins are proposed auxin efflux transporters, and auxin fluxes can seemingly be predicted based on the\u2014in many cells\u2014asymmetric plasma membrane distribution of PINs. Here, we show in a heterologous <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte system as well as in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> inflorescence stems that PIN-mediated auxin transport is directly activated by D6 PROTEIN KINASE (D6PK) and PINOID (PID)/WAG kinases of the Arabidopsis AGCVIII kinase family. At the same time, we reveal that D6PKs and PID have differential phosphosite preferences. Our study suggests that PIN activation by protein kinases is a crucial component of auxin transport control that must be taken into account to understand auxin distribution within the plant."

The directed cell-to-cell distribution of auxin is achieved through a system of auxin influx and efflux transporters. PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins are proposed auxin efflux transporters, and auxin fluxes can seemingly be predicted based on the\u2014in many cells\u2014asymmetric plasma membrane distribution of PINs. Here, we show in a heterologous <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte system as well as in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> inflorescence stems that PIN-mediated auxin transport is directly activated by D6 PROTEIN KINASE (D6PK) and PINOID (PID)/WAG kinases of the Arabidopsis AGCVIII kinase family. At the same time, we reveal that D6PKs and PID have differential phosphosite preferences. Our study suggests that PIN activation by protein kinases is a crucial component of auxin transport control that must be taken into account to understand auxin distribution within the plant."

As such, proper plant development and morphology strictly require the directed cell-to-cell transport of auxin, which is achieved by a system of auxin influx and efflux transporters (<a href=\"#bib35\">Teale et al., 2006</a>). AUXIN RESISTANT1 (AUX1)/LIKE-AUX1 (LAX) proteins are auxin influx transporters and PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins, which have been proposed to act in concert with ABC transporters, are the proposed auxin efflux transporters (<a href=\"#bib14\">Galweiler et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Friml et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Noh et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Geisler et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bainbridge et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Peret et al., 2012</a>).

The D6PK family is comprised of four functionally redundant members, namely D6PK, D6PK-LIKE1 (D6PKL1), D6PKL2 and D6PKL3. Although D6PKs are devoid of any sequence features indicative for an association of these protein kinases with the plasma membrane, D6PKs colocalize with PIN proteins at the basal (rootward) plasma membrane in cells of the root cortex and stele, the hypocotyl and main inflorescence stem as well as the shoot apical meristem (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zourelidou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barbosa et al., 2014</a>). D6PKs phosphorylate PIN proteins in vitro and PIN phosphorylation is reduced in <i>d6pk</i> mutants in vivo without affecting PIN distribution or strongly affecting PIN abundance (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zourelidou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Willige et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barbosa et al., 2014</a>). Just as the PINs, D6PK constitutively cycles intracellularly between endosomal compartments and the plasma membrane but both, PINs and D6PK, traffic via distinct intracellular routes and seemingly encounter each other only at the basal plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barbosa et al., 2014</a>). Since PIN phosphorylation, as assessed by evaluating overall PIN1 and PIN3 phosphorylation levels, rapidly reacts to the presence and absence of D6PK at the plasma membrane, we postulated that D6PKs directly activate auxin transport by PIN phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Willige et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barbosa et al., 2014</a>). This hypothesis has, however, never been tested."

Phosphorylation of PINs by PID/WAGs has previously been proposed to control PIN polarity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Friml et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Michniewicz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Huang et al., 2010</a>).

Modulating PIN phosphorylation either by PID or WAG overexpression or by introducing phosphorylation-mimicking mutants in PIN1 seemingly results in a basal-to-apical shift in PIN polar distribution (<a href=\"#bib22\">Michniewicz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Huang et al., 2010</a>). The proposed loss of PIN phosphorylation in the <i>pid</i> mutant has been used to explain the phenotypic similarity between <i>pin1</i> and <i>pid</i> mutants: <i>pin1</i> mutants, on the one side, have a pin-formed inflorescence because they are devoid of the central auxin efflux protein required for shoot meristem differentiation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Galweiler et al., 1998</a>); <i>pid</i> mutants, on the other side, are deficient in PIN1 phosphorylation, which seemingly prevents the essential basal-to-apical polarity switch required to redirect auxin fluxes during differentiation at the shoot meristem (<a href=\"#bib12\">Friml et al., 2004</a>)."

During phototropic bending of the hypocotyl, the polarity of the relevant PIN3 protein changes upon light exposure and this polarity switch is required for auxin redistribution in the hypocotyl and for efficient phototropism. This PIN3 polarity change requires the activity of PID/WAG protein kinases and it has been proposed that PID/WAG-dependent PIN3 phosphorylations directly control this process (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ding et al., 2011</a>). We showed previously that D6PKs also play a critical role in this process: <i>d6pk</i> mutants are strongly impaired in phototropic hypocotyl bending and the inability of <i>d6pk</i> mutants to efficiently transport auxin from the cotyledons to the hypocotyl may be responsible for this tropism defect (<a href=\"#bib37\">Willige et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, the light-induced and PID/WAG-dependent PIN3 polarity changes required for hypocotyl bending can still take place in the absence of <i>D6PKs</i> suggesting that the function of PID/WAGs in auxin transport and phototropism can be uncoupled from that of the D6PKs and that both kinases may control PINs independently and differentially (<a href=\"#bib37\">Willige et al., 2013</a>). While the differential biological function of D6PK and PID/WAGs in the context of phototropism may be explained by the two kinases being active in different tissues or during different stages of the phototropism response, there is also evidence that the two kinases have differential biochemical activities. While the overexpression of PID and WAG kinases results in a basal-to-apical PIN shift, the overexpression of D6PKs does not affect PIN distribution (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zourelidou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</a>). Inversely, the loss of <i>PID</i> function results in strong differentiation defects of the primary inflorescence, which are not apparent in the <i>d6pk</i> mutants. Thus, there is evidence for a differential biochemical activity of D6PKs and PID/WAGs but the molecular basis of this differential activity remains to be determined."

In these experiments, the auxin efflux activity of PINs was deduced from the reduced amount of radiolabeled auxin that accumulated in cells (over-)expressing certain PIN proteins in comparison to control samples. Because these experiments used passive loading of auxin, it is unclear if the differences in intracellular auxin accumulation observed in these experiments are truly a result of differences in auxin efflux or a consequence of differences in auxin uptake. In other studies, auxin efflux was shown based on differences in auxin retention after passive loading and subsequent transfer to auxin-free medium, thereby reversing the electrochemical gradient. In these studies, background transport activities could not be ruled out and differences became apparent only at endpoint steady-state levels. To date, there has been no report of a heterologous expression system that allows measuring auxin export directly in the linear phase."

We map the phosphosites of these kinases in the PINs and further show that phosphorylation of conserved phosphosites is required for the efficient activation of PIN1 and PIN3. Our study strongly suggests that the activation of PIN-mediated auxin efflux by protein kinases is a crucial component of auxin transport control that must be taken into account to understand auxin distribution within the plant."

Mutants with defects in multiple <i>D6PK</i> genes such as <i>d6pk d6pkl1</i> (<i>d6pk01</i>) double and <i>d6pk d6pkl1 d6pkl2</i> (<i>d6pk012</i>) triple mutants are severely impaired in several developmental processes including tropic responses (<i>d6pk01 and d6pk012</i>) and lateral root differentiation (<i>d6pk012</i>) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zourelidou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Willige et al., 2013</a>). In inflorescence stems, auxin is transported primarily in a basipetal (rootward) direction (<a href=\"#bib35\">Teale et al., 2006</a>). To understand the contribution of the individual <i>D6PK</i> genes to auxin transport in inflorescence stems, we measured basipetal auxin transport in primary inflorescence stems of a selected set of <i>d6pk</i> single, double and triple mutants that represented a previously established phenotypic series (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zourelidou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Willige et al., 2013</a>). In these experiments, we noted a decrease in auxin transport in mutants of increased mutant complexity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). While auxin transport defects were comparatively subtle in <i>d6pk</i> single mutants, the decrease in basipetal auxin transport was as strongly impaired in the <i>d6pk012</i> triple mutant as in mutants of <i>PIN1</i>, a major PIN protein in this tissue (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Furthermore, we found that <i>D6PKs</i> are coexpressed with <i>PINs</i> in stems (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and that both, D6PK and PIN1, localize to the basal plasma membrane in cells where auxin levels are high as suggested by the auxin response reporter <i>DR5:GFP</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

To test this hypothesis, we established a heterologous test system for measuring auxin efflux using Xenopus <i>laevis</i> oocytes. In this assay, in vitro transcribed cRNAs for the proteins under investigation were injected into the oocytes 4 days prior to the experiment to allow for protein synthesis. At the beginning of the experiment, radiolabeled IAA was injected and the amount of residual radiolabel was measured in the oocytes after incubation for up to 30 min. PIN as well as D6PK protein accumulated at the plasma membrane also in oocytes as shown by immunoblots for PINs and confocal microscopy for D6PK (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). An inherent feature of this assay system was the gradual loss of the injected radiolabeled IAA from the oocytes over time\u2013in the absence of exogenous proteins\u2013which we attributed to the leakiness of the plasma membrane for IAA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>). Interestingly, when we tested PIN1 or PIN3 alone, we did not observe any measurable auxin efflux that differed from the background, suggesting that the PINs are inactive auxin transporters in the oocyte system. However, when we co-expressed D6PK with the PINs we observed a significant and kinase activity-dependent activation of auxin efflux. This activation correlated with the appearance of high molecular weight bands for PIN1 and PIN3 that appeared in anti-PIN immunoblots only in the presence of the active D6PK kinase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In line with an activation of PINs by D6PK through direct PIN phosphorylation, a kinase-dead variant of D6PK could not activate auxin efflux in this system (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,F</a>). In summary, these experiments showed that D6PK is an activator of PIN-mediated auxin efflux in the oocyte expression system."

In the experiments with the synthetic peptides, we could confirm the identity and phosphorylation of the novel S4 and S5 phosphosites using mutant peptides as negative controls where the respective S had been replaced by an alanine (A) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Since S5 from PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7 corresponded to D215 in PIN1 and since D215 was embedded in an otherwise highly conserved part of the protein, we were also interested in testing whether a serine (S) in a PIN1 D215S variant could be phosphorylated by D6PK. Indeed, while a synthetic peptide comprising PIN1 D215 could not be phosphorylated by D6PK in vitro, the D215S peptide variant was efficiently phosphorylated indicating that, although the respective S5 phosphosite was not conserved, the sequence conservation in this region was sufficient for phosphorylation by D6PK. This was suggestive for an overall structural conservation of this PIN1 protein domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In contrast, PIN2-specific peptides corresponding to the S4 or S5 phosphosites could not be phosphorylated by D6PK despite the fact that their sequences also contained serine residues. Phosphorylation of the corresponding peptides also failed when an asparagine (N) at the respective position was replaced by a serine (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thus, S4 and S5 are novel PIN protein phosphosites that are differentially conserved in the five plasma membrane-resident PIN proteins with a role in promoting auxin efflux."

In turn, mutations of the phosphosites PIN1 S1, PIN1 S2 or PIN1 S3 alone impaired phosphorylation by D6PK to a lesser extent (ca. 80%) and only mutation of all three sites in PIN1 S1A S2A S3A led to a clear reduction of PIN1 CL phosphorylation (58%; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

Thus, D6PK and PID have an overlapping but also differential preference for specific phosphosites in PIN1.

Whereas a PIN3 CL S4A S5A variant was still efficiently phosphorylated by PID its phosphorylation by D6PK was severely impaired (28%; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>).

In line with the proposed important role of S4 for PIN1 phosphorylation, we found that a PIN1 S4A mutant was already significantly impaired in auxin efflux activation by D6PK in the auxin efflux experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). At the same time, the requirement of PIN1 S1, S2, and S3 for D6PK activation was not obvious with a PIN1 S1A S2A S3A mutant but became apparent in the presence of the S4A mutation where the PIN1 activation defect of the S4A mutation was further enhanced in the presence of mutations of the other three sites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We thus concluded that PIN1 S4 is an important site for D6PK-dependent PIN1 activation but that all four phosphosites are required for full PIN1 activation. Also, in line with the results obtained in the in vitro phosphorylation experiments, we found that a PIN3 S4A S5A variant showed reduced responsiveness to D6PK when compared to wild type PIN3 providing further support for the importance of the S4 and S5 phosphosites for PIN activation by D6PK (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

While the mutant and the wild type transgene were able to complement the PID-dependent inflorescence differentiation defect of the <i>pin1</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), D6PK-dependent basipetal auxin transport in the stem was compromised (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Since the mutation of the S4 phosphosite may potentially interfere with the polar distribution or the intracellular transport of the constantly trafficking PIN1 protein, we analyzed the polar distribution of PIN1 S4A and its sensitivity to the trafficking inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since PIN1 S4A showed an identical behavior to wild type PIN1 in these experiments, we concluded that changes in PIN1 polarity, PIN1 trafficking or PIN1 abundance at the plasma membrane may not be causal for the observed differences in basipetal auxin transport. We also evaluated the effects of PIN3 phosphosite mutations using the ability of <i>PIN3</i> transgenes to complement the strong phototropism defect of the <i>pin3 pin4 pin7</i> (<i>pin347</i>) triple mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Willige et al., 2013</a>). When we measured the ability of wild type PIN3 and mutant PIN3 S4A S5A to complement the <i>pin347</i> mutant when expressed from a <i>PIN3</i> promoter fragment, we found that the phototropism defect of the <i>pin347</i> mutant was only partially complemented by the PIN3 S4A S5A transgene while it was fully complemented by wild type PIN3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). This finding was in line with the hypothesis that D6PK-dependent PIN3 S4 and S5 phosphorylations are required for efficient basipetal auxin transport in the hypocotyls of dark-grown seedlings, which is a prerequisite for efficient hypocotyl bending. Consistent with the predominant role of the PID phosphosite phosphorylation at S1\u2013S3, we found that the mutation of the PIN3 S1\u2013S3 phosphosites as well as mutation of all five PIN3 phosphosites, S1\u2013S5, fully impaired the ability of the PIN3 transgene to complement the <i>pin347</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). This finding can be explained by the essential role of PID-dependent PIN3 polarity changes in the hypocotyl that take place after light exposure and that are required for phototropic hypocotyl bending. As we had previously shown, the PID-dependent PIN3 polarity change after phototropic stimulation is a distinct process that is independent from the regulation of basipetal auxin transport in the dark-grown seedling (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ding et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Willige et al., 2013</a>). In summary, this experiment supported the conclusion that the novel phosphosites, PIN3 S4 and S5, are required for full PIN3 activity, most likely by interfering primarily with basipetal auxin transport in the hypocotyls of dark-grown seedlings."

To this end, we employed selected reaction monitoring (SRM), a mass spectrometry technique that allows detection and quantification of specific peptides and their phosphorylated variants in total protein preparations (<a href=\"#bib29\">Picotti and Aebersold, 2012</a>). In these experiments, we detected a strong reduction in the in vivo abundance of the PIN1 S4 as well as PIN3 S4 phosphorylations that increased with increasing <i>d6pk</i> mutant complexity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). This decrease in S4 phosphorylation could not be explained by changes in the overall abundance of PIN proteins as shown by quantitative SRM analyses of the unphosphorylated PIN1 and PIN3 S4 peptides and analyses of internal control peptides (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Furthermore, introducing a <i>D6PK</i> transgene expressing <i>D6PK</i> under control of a <i>D6PK</i> promoter fragment rescued the PIN1 and PIN3 S4 phosphorylation defects (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>). We also examined phosphorylation at PIN3 S5 using the same methodology and observed that the abundance of phosphorylation at these sites was as strongly reduced in the <i>d6pk012</i> triple mutant as observed for the S4 site. Again, the phosphorylation defect could not be explained by changes in PIN3 abundance and was rescued by a <i>D6PK</i> transgene as described above (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Most importantly, the observed decreases in PIN1 and PIN3 phosphorylation were in good agreement with the reductions in auxin transport that we had detected in the same tissue of <i>d6pk</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We therefore concluded that D6PKs are the major kinases targeting PIN1 S4, PIN3 S4, and PIN3 S5 in Arabidopsis inflorescence stems and that the reduced phosphorylation at these sites may be causal for the reduced auxin transport of <i>d6pk</i> mutants in this tissue."

Besides D6PKs and the already introduced PID/WAGs, other AGCVIII kinases such as the phototropin blue light receptors phot1 and phot2 as well as UNICORN (UCN) have known biological functions (<a href=\"#bib18\">Inoue et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Enugutti et al., 2012</a>). We were interested in testing the ability of these protein kinases to activate PIN-mediated auxin efflux and examined PID, WAG2 as well as phot1 and UCN together with PIN1 in the oocyte auxin transport assay (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Interestingly, PID and WAG2 but not phot1 or UCN were able to activate PIN1-mediated auxin efflux (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We thus concluded that PID and WAG2 have a role in PIN activation besides their previously reported role in the control of PIN polarity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Friml et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</a>)."

These experiments demonstrated that D6PK and PID cannot functionally replace each other when expressed from the promoter of the respective other gene (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Whereas the expression of <i>PID</i> from a <i>PID</i> promoter fragment was sufficient to complement the phenotypes of a <i>pid</i> mutant, the expression of <i>D6PK</i> under control of the <i>PID</i> promoter fragment failed to complement <i>pid</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Inversely, <i>D6PK</i> but not <i>PID</i> expression from a <i>D6PK</i> promoter fragment was sufficient to complement the <i>d6pk012</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). In summary, these genetic experiments supported our conclusion that D6PK and PID/WAGs are functionally divergent and these findings and conclusions are in line with previous observations on the differential effects of these two kinases in PIN polarity control (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</a>). These differential phosophosite preferences as detected in in vitro as well as in vivo phosphosite analyses may be the basis of the distinct roles of the two kinases in the control of PIN polarity and plant growth control."

In these analyses, we detected concentration-, time- and D6PK-dependent increases in the phosphorylation of PIN1 S4, PIN3 S4 and PIN3 S5 already 15 min after auxin application (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134</a>). While these increases were clearly observed in the wild type, only marginal increases in PIN phosphorylation at these sites were observed in the phosphorylation deficient <i>d6pk012</i> mutant. At the same time, phosphorylation at the preferential PID target site S1 was neither strongly impaired in <i>d6pk012</i> mutants when compared to a <i>d6pk012</i> mutant expressing a complementing <i>D6PK</i> transgene nor clearly induced by auxin (<a href=\"#fig8s4\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplements 4 and 5</a>). Furthermore, in agreement with an auxin-dependent control of PIN phosphorylation at S4 and S5, we detected increased phosphorylation at S4 and S5 in the auxin-overproducing <i>yucca</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Zhao et al., 2001</a>). Although the analyses of the control peptides showed that there is also an overall increase in PIN abundance in <i>yucca</i>, the relative increases in phosphosite phosphorylations exceeded the increases in overall PIN abundance suggesting that PIN phosphorylation is activated in this mutant when compared to the wild type."

This cycling is highly sensitive to the trafficking inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA) and in selected BFA-treatment conditions D6PK can be depleted from the plasma membrane without significantly affecting the plasma membrane abundance of PIN1 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barbosa et al., 2014</a>). The differential BFA-sensitivity of D6PK and PIN allowed us testing the contribution of plasma membrane-resident D6PK to PIN phosphorylation. For this purpose, we generated a phosphosite-specific antibody for PIN1 S4 that efficiently detected S4 phosphorylated PIN1 at the plasma membrane but failed to detect PIN1 S4A (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, we found that PIN1 S4 phosphorylation was strongly decreased already minutes after BFA treatment when D6PK had become dissociated from the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Thus, PIN1 S4 phosphorylation depended on the presence of D6PK or other BFA-sensitive protein kinases at the plasma membrane."

We showed that <i>d6pk</i> mutants are impaired in basipetal auxin transport in inflorescence stems and postulated that PINs may be directly activated by D6PKs. This hypothesis was supported by the facts that D6PK colocalized with the basally localized PIN1 and PIN3 proteins in various cell types, that D6PKs phosphorylated PINs in vitro and that D6PKs influence PIN1 and PIN3 phosphorylation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zourelidou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Willige et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barbosa et al., 2014</a>). Here, we tested this hypothetical functional relationship by examining PIN1 or PIN3 activity and auxin transport at various levels. We showed that basipetal auxin transport was reduced in inflorescence stems of <i>d6pk</i> mutants and that PIN-mediated auxin efflux was activated by D6PK in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes. Furthermore, we could rule out that the decreases in auxin transport as measured in inflorescence stems are the consequence of changes in PIN abundance as demonstrated using confocal imaging, immunoblotting, and SRM analyses of PIN proteins. We furthermore demonstrated that D6PK-dependent PIN activation was dependent on specific phosphosites in PIN1 and PIN3. Taken together, all our findings support the conclusion that D6PKs are major regulators of PIN-mediated auxin transport in inflorescence stems. Since <i>d6pk</i> mutants have a number of phenotypes such as gravitropism defects in the root, negative gravitropism defects in the hypocotyl, phototropism defects in the hypocotyl as well as defects in lateral root initiation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zourelidou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Willige et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barbosa et al., 2014</a>), we are tempted to speculate that these other <i>d6pk</i> mutant phenotypes are also the consequence of reduced auxin transport activity of PINs in the absence of the PIN-activating D6PK kinases."

This conclusion found support also in the analysis of the in vivo phosphorylation levels at these sites since phosphorylation at S4 and S5 was strongly reduced in the <i>d6pk012</i> mutant. Interestingly, the preferential D6PK phosphosites S4 and S5 are not conserved in PIN2 and it is striking that the respective domains in PIN2 carry small insertions when compared to the other PIN proteins. Thus, the activation of PINs by phosphorylation may be regulated by the presence and abundance of activating kinases such as D6PK but also by the availability and conservation of phosphosites in their PIN targets."

Besides phosphorylations at S1, which are not affected in <i>d6pk012</i> mutants, S2 and S3 would be other possible target sites since their mutation further impairs D6PK-dependent PIN phosphorylation in vitro and auxin transport in the oocyte system. In this respect, it is unfortunate that we were unable, for technical reasons, to measure phosphorylation at S2 and S3 in the <i>d6pk</i> and <i>pid</i> mutants."

While we found that PID and WAG2 activate PIN-mediated auxin efflux in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes, we showed at the same time that PID has different phosphosite preferences when compared to D6PK. We observed these phosphosite preferences when analyzing PIN phosphorylation at S1\u2013S5 in in vitro phosphorylation experiments, auxin transport in oocytes, and PIN phosphorylation by quantitative mass spectrometry in the <i>d6pk012</i>, <i>pid</i> and <i>wag1 wag2</i> mutants. Whereas D6PK appeared to have a preference for the S4 and S5 sites in PIN1 and PIN3, PID preferentially phosphorylated the previously identified S1\u2013S3 phosphosites.

The respective inverse observations were made with PID. Whereas PID phosphorylation and activation of PIN1 was strongly impaired when S1\u2013S3 were mutated, full impairment of phosphorylation and activation could only be achieved after S4 mutation. In this respect, we consider the complementation experiments of the <i>pin1</i> mutant with the wild type PIN1 and the mutant PIN1 S4A transgenes particularly insightful. Here, we found that basipetal auxin transport in the inflorescence stem was partially impaired when PIN1 S1 was mutated whereas the strong inflorescence differentiation phenotype of the <i>pin1</i> mutant was rescued. The partial complementation of the <i>pin1</i> auxin transport defect indicates that PIN1 S4 is not the only phosphosite required for D6PK-dependent PIN1 activation and basipetal auxin transport. As such, this result is in agreement with the results of our in vitro phosphorylation and oocyte auxin transport experiments, which showed that D6PK can also activate PIN1 through S1\u2013S3 phosphorylation. On the other side, the rescue of the differentiation defect can be explained because the PIN1 S4A protein still contained the preferential phosphorylation sites for PID. As shown in the in vitro phosphorylation experiment as well as in the oocyte auxin transport experiment, the PIN1 S4A mutant variant is neither strongly impaired in its phosphorylation by PID nor in its activation by PID. Thus, the essential phosphosites required for PID-dependent PIN activation and PIN polarity changes are retained in PIN1 S4A. Therefore, the selective functionality of this mutant PIN1 in the context of inflorescence development indirectly supports the findings of our other analyses."

We had previously shown that <i>d6pk d6pkl1</i> double mutants as well as <i>pin347</i> triple mutants are severely compromised in phototropic hypocotyl bending (<a href=\"#bib37\">Willige et al., 2013</a>). We had shown that this phenotype could be explained by a strong defect in basipetal auxin transport and the apparent accumulation of auxin in the cotyledons of dark-grown seedlings, which, in turn, correlated with the absence of an auxin maximum in the bending zone of the hypocotyl (<a href=\"#bib37\">Willige et al., 2013</a>). At the same time, PID-dependent PIN3 polarity changes could still take place in the <i>d6pk012</i> mutant indicating that PID can function independently from D6PK on PIN3. Our observation that the PIN3 S4A S5A transgene could only partially rescue the <i>pin347</i> triple mutant phenotype supports the notion that phosphorylation at these sites is important for PIN3 activation but suggests further that other phosphosites, such as S1\u2013S3, may also be targeted by D6PK. This partial inactivation of an S4A S5A mutated PIN3 as observed <i>in planta</i> is in agreement with the partial impairment of PIN3 S4A S5A phosphorylation in in vitro phosphorylation experiments with D6PK as well as the fact that there is still a residual activation when PIN3 S4A S5A is activated with D6PK in the oocyte system. With regard to the relevance of S1\u2013S3 for PIN3 function, we found that mutation of PIN3 S1\u2013S3 or S1\u2013S5 rendered this PIN3 non-functional when introduced as a transgene into <i>pin347</i>. Since these mutant PIN3 variants would be expected to be impaired in D6PK-dependent basipetal auxin transport as well as in PID-dependent PIN3 polarity changes, it is difficult based on the present depth of analysis to judge whether the non-functionality of PIN3 S1A\u2013S3A or PIN3 S1A\u2013S5A is primarily caused by a defect in basipetal auxin transport, a defect in changing PIN3 polarity or a combination of both."

The analysis of auxin transport in Arabidopsis inflorescence stems suggested that this might indeed be the primary function of this modification since auxin transport was strongly impaired in <i>d6pk</i> loss-of-function mutants while PIN abundance at the plasma membrane was not altered. This observation does, however, not rule out that PIN phosphorylation has other regulatory roles such control of PIN polarity by PID or WAG-dependent phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Friml et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</a>). Changes in PIN polarity as they are observed after <i>PID</i> or <i>WAG2</i> overexpression are not observed after <i>D6PK</i> overexpression (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zourelidou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barbosa et al., 2014</a>). The differential effect of D6PK and PID/WAGs on PIN may have its molecular basis in the differential phosphosite preferences of the two kinases. Common to both kinases seems, however, the fact that their phosphorylation activity is antagonistically regulated by phosphatases. While the phenotypic effects of PID can be antagonized by PP2A phosphatases (<a href=\"#bib22\">Michniewicz et al., 2007</a>), removal of the D6PK from the plasma membrane through BFA treatment resulted in an almost immediate decrease in PIN1 phosphorylation. Thus, it can be speculated that also D6PK-dependent PIN phosphorylation is antagonized by phosphatases, the identities of which remain to be determined."

Using quantitative SRM analyses, we could show that PIN1 S4 as well as PIN3 S4 and S5 phosphorylation increases in response to auxin treatment in the wild type. In the <i>d6pk012</i> mutant, the loss of phosphorylation at these preferential D6PK phosphosites could not be compensated by auxin application suggesting that these auxin-dependent phosphorylations are D6PK-dependent and may be mediated either directly by D6PK or by D6PK acting as an indirect auxiliary factor. Although we observed a minor increase in PIN phosphorylation at the D6PK phosphosites in the <i>d6pk012</i> triple mutant, these increases were comparatively minor and may be attributed to phosphorylation through D6PKL3, which is still expressed in the <i>d6pk012</i> mutant. Alternatively, they may be attributed to the activity of other PIN-regulatory kinases such as the PID/WAGs or other as yet uncharacterized protein kinases. Theoretically, it could be envisioned that the auxin-dependent increases in PIN phosphorylation are the consequence of the previously reported inhibitory effects of auxin on PIN endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Paciorek et al., 2005</a>). In this case, PIN phosphorylating kinases would encounter their PIN targets simply for a longer period of time thereby increasing the chances for phosphorylation. Unraveling the identity of the underlying auxin-sensory mechanism and its molecular details will be an interesting avenue for future investigations (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Parry et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Robert et al., 2010</a>)."

In contrast, we report here that auxin promotes PIN phosphorylation in inflorescence stems as determined by quantitative mass spectrometry of PIN1 S4, PIN3 S4 and PIN3 S5. It is at present difficult for us to reconcile these two apparently contrasting observations. We can therefore only argue that PIN phosphorylation is controlled by different auxin-dependent regulatory mechanisms in different tissues."

The differential PIN-dependent distribution of auxin within the plant is of pivotal importance for the regulation of a multitude of processes in plant growth and development. It is our view that the activation of PINs by D6PKs and PID/WAGs is a crucial component of the control of auxin transport that must be taken into account to understand auxin transport within the plant and to ultimately understand plant growth."

Oocytes were injected with \u223c50 nl of a 1:1 mixture of cRNAs for PIN and protein kinase. If only PIN or protein kinase cRNA was injected, the cRNA was mixed 1:1 with water (mock control).

Transport rates of different biological replicates (i.e. oocytes collected from different female donors) were averaged and are presented as mean and standard error of at least three biological replicates. Comparability in protein expression between the respective wild type and mutant protein variants and between the experiments was confirmed using immunoblots or confocal laser scanning microscopy with a Axiovert 200 M microscope equipped with a LSM 510 META laser scanning unit (Zeiss, Jena, Germany)."

Peptides were eluted from a 75 \u00b5m analytical column (Easy Columns, Thermo Scientific, Ulm, Germany) on a linear gradient running from 10% to 30% acetonitrile in 60 min and were ionized by electrospray directly into the mass spectrometer. Specifically, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides were selected as targets of analysis after optimization of ionization conditions using the standard peptides. Visible transitions were selected from acquired mass spectra of the synthetic standard peptides. A list of transitions used for each (phospho)peptide sequence is available as <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>. The quadrupole Q1 was set as a mass filter for the respective parent ion, while Q3 was set to monitor specific fragment ions. For each peptide, at least three fragment ions were used. Mass width for Q1 and Q3 was 0.7 Da, scan time 5 ms."

In brief, <i>pin1</i> mutants are defective in basipetal auxin transport in the stem and they are unable to form local auxin maxima required for lateral organ differentiation. The latter process requires a PIN1 polarity change that is mediated by PIN1 phosphorylation at the preferential PID phosphosites S1\u2013S3. In the PIN1 S4A mutant, the phosphorylation at the S1\u2013S3 phosphosites can still take place and, therefore, PIN1 polarity changes can still occur, local auxin maxima can form and the <i>pin1</i> mutant phenotype is rescued. At the same time, we find that <i>pin1</i> with the PIN1 S4A transgene is impaired in auxin transport. This finding is in line with the observations in the oocyte experiment where mutation of S4 also partially impairs auxin efflux. According to the oocyte experiments, additional mutations of S1 \u2013 S3 would be needed to fully impair basipetal auxin transport but such an experiment would not allow us judging the importance of the previously uncharacterized S4 phosphosite."

The auxin effect through TIR1/AFBs must thus be explained by another as yet unknown mechanism. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have paid particular attention to carefully word our interpretation of this result since it cannot be explained by currently known signaling mechanisms.

With the high qualitative standards that were applied to the experiments presented in the present manuscript, these experiments would frequently take close to a year from the moment of experimental planning, sample preparation, and sample analysis. We personally see a great potential in extending these analyses to further the understanding of auxin transport regulation per se that can give a resolution of signaling events at the protein molecular levels that is comparable to DNA sequencing.

This is why the SRM analyses as well as the analyses with the PIN1 S4A and PIN1 S4A S5A lines are particularly valuable, because they do show that in agreement with the in vitro phosphorylation experiments and the oocyte experiments, S4 and S5 do not exclusively contribute to PIN activation by D6PK (or PID). A \u201cweakness\u201d of the SRM analysis is that it cannot correct for the respective amount of kinase, D6PK or PID, in the sample thus the non-reduction in S4 phosphorylation in the pid sample may reflect the fact that few cells express PID in the tissue under investigation.
