One factor not yet considered is the \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABAR), an extrasynaptic inhibitory receptor which first emerges on dendritic spines at puberty in female mice. Here we show that \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABARs trigger adolescent pruning. Spine density of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells decreased by half post-pubertally in female wild-type but not \u03b14 KO mice. This effect was associated with decreased expression of kalirin-7 (Kal7), a spine protein which controls actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Kal7 decreased at puberty as a result of reduced NMDAR activation due to \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4-mediated inhibition. In the absence of this inhibition, Kal7 expression was unchanged at puberty. In the unpruned condition, spatial re-learning was impaired. These data suggest that pubertal pruning requires \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABARs. In their absence, pruning is prevented and cognition is not optimal."
