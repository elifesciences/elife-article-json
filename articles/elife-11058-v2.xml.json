As a prerequisite for activation of mTORC1 by hormones and mitogens, there first has to be an available pool of intracellular amino acids. Arginine, an amino acid essential during mammalian embryogenesis and early development is one of the key activators of mTORC1. Herein, we demonstrate that arginine acts independently of its metabolism to allow maximal activation of mTORC1 by growth factors via a mechanism that does not involve regulation of mTORC1 localization to lysosomes. Instead, arginine specifically suppresses lysosomal localization of the TSC complex and interaction with its target small GTPase protein, Rheb. By interfering with TSC-Rheb complex, arginine relieves allosteric inhibition of Rheb by TSC. Arginine cooperates with growth factor signaling which further promotes dissociation of TSC2 from lysosomes and activation of mTORC1. Arginine is the main amino acid sensed by the mTORC1 pathway in several cell types including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Dependence on arginine is maintained once hESCs are differentiated to fibroblasts, neurons, and hepatocytes, highlighting the fundamental importance of arginine-sensing to mTORC1 signaling. Together, our data provide evidence that different growth promoting cues cooperate to a greater extent than previously recognized to achieve tight spatial and temporal regulation of mTORC1 signaling."

As a prerequisite for activation of mTORC1 by hormones and mitogens, there first has to be an available pool of intracellular amino acids. Arginine, an amino acid essential during mammalian embryogenesis and early development is one of the key activators of mTORC1. Herein, we demonstrate that arginine acts independently of its metabolism to allow maximal activation of mTORC1 by growth factors via a mechanism that does not involve regulation of mTORC1 localization to lysosomes. Instead, arginine specifically suppresses lysosomal localization of the TSC complex and interaction with its target small GTPase protein, Rheb. By interfering with TSC-Rheb complex, arginine relieves allosteric inhibition of Rheb by TSC. Arginine cooperates with growth factor signaling which further promotes dissociation of TSC2 from lysosomes and activation of mTORC1. Arginine is the main amino acid sensed by the mTORC1 pathway in several cell types including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Dependence on arginine is maintained once hESCs are differentiated to fibroblasts, neurons, and hepatocytes, highlighting the fundamental importance of arginine-sensing to mTORC1 signaling. Together, our data provide evidence that different growth promoting cues cooperate to a greater extent than previously recognized to achieve tight spatial and temporal regulation of mTORC1 signaling."

The experiments show that arginine is the major amino acid that influences whether mTORC1 can be activated in several different types of human cell. When cells were deprived of arginine, the activity of the complex was strongly suppressed. However, microscopy showed that arginine had no effect on whether mTORC1 was found at the lysosomes or not, which suggests that arginine might be acting in a different way to other amino acids."

The two most proximal regulators of mTORC1 are small GTPases of the Ras superfamily: Rheb and the Rag GTPases. Both are considered to be resident on the cytoplasmic surface of the lysosome, a site that has in recent years come to the very forefront of mTORC1 signal integration (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sancak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Buerger et al., 2006</a>). The Rag GTPases facilitate signaling of amino acids to mTORC1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sancak et al., 2008</a>), a stimulus that has long been known to be both necessary and sufficient, albeit minimally, for mTORC1 activation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Long et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hara et al., 1998</a>). The current consensus is that amino acids activate mTORC1 by promoting its localization to the cytoplasmic surface of late endosomes and lysosomes (for simplicity this mTOR-positive compartment is referred to as lysosomes) via a heterodimeric complex of Rag GTPases (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sancak et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">2010</a>). There are four mammalian Rag GTPases that show functional redundancy, A or B dimerize with C or D and unlike most small GTPases they rely on another complex, the Ragulator, for tethering them at the membrane. The Ragulator complex further acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to activate the Rag GTPases and works in opposition to the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) complex, GATOR1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bar-Peled et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">2013</a>) to ensure the tight control of Rag GTPases and therefore mTORC1 activity."

Rheb is the master activator of mTORC1 and, although the mechanism by which GTP-loaded Rheb stimulates mTORC1 kinase activity remains unknown (<a href=\"#bib2\">Avruch et al., 2009</a>), it has been demonstrated that the nucleotide and therefore activity status of Rheb is controlled by a wide range of upstream stimuli. Potent mTORC1 regulators, for example energy status via AMPK and growth factors via PI3K and Akt converge upstream of Rheb to positively or negatively control the TSC complex (<a href=\"#bib26\">Inoki et al., 2003b</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang and Manning, 2008</a>). The TSC complex consists of TSC1, TBC1D7, and TSC2, where TSC2 has GAP activity that specifically inactivates Rheb (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Inoki et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Garami et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dibble et al., 2012</a>). Phosphorylation of TSC2 by Akt has recently been shown to regulate localization of the TSC complex to the cytoplasm and away from the lysosome thereby preventing Rheb inactivation and promoting mTORC1 activation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Menon et al., 2014</a>). The regulation of TSC2 localization to the lysosome has also been associated with the amino acid/Rag GTPase axis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Demetriades et al., 2014</a>), indicating that the underlying mechanisms controlling the opposing localization of mTOR and TSC2 to the lysosome involve complex interplay between different upstream stimuli."

We demonstrate that TSC2 localization is modulated by arginine together with the classical TSC regulators, growth factors, to tightly control Rheb and ultimately mTORC1 activity in a spatial and temporal manner. Arginine is likely to act as an intact molecule as its metabolism is not required for mTORC1 activation but it remains to be elucidated whether the effect is direct or indirect. Finally, arginine is the only amino acid that mTORC1 activity shows sensitivity to in both undifferentiated stem cells and subsequent differentiated lineages demonstrating the fundamental importance of the mechanism described herein.

Leucine in particular has been well documented for its role in the regulation of mTORC1 and its growth-promoting properties. However, the contribution and mechanisms of action of other amino acids are not as well understood. To further explore amino acid signaling, we investigated the sensitivity of mTORC1 to essential and conditionally essential amino acids in a panel of cell lines. Acute deprivation of leucine, arginine, or glutamine alone was observed to significantly perturb mTORC1 activity in multiple cell lines (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013G</a> and see, among others [<a href=\"#bib16\">Duran et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nicklin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jewell et al., 2015</a>]). Deprivation of other single amino acids, including isoleucine and methionine, did not significantly affect mTORC1 activity in any cell line tested (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013G</a> and data not shown). Interestingly, mTORC1 was found to be differentially sensitive to amino acids in different cell lines. For example, sensitivity to glutamine, previously associated with leucine-dependent and -independent mechanisms of mTORC1 regulation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Duran et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nicklin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jewell et al., 2015</a>), varied significantly. While glutamine was essential for mTORC1 activation in both HeLa and HEK293T cells, it was less important in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs). Similarly, removal of leucine significantly suppressed mTORC1 activity in most cell lines with an exception of HeLa and U2OS. Of particular interest, we found that mTORC1 activity is dependent on arginine in every cell line tested. Therefore, this amino acid appears to be a fundamentally important regulator of mTORC1."

No one individual amino acid is sufficient to activate mTORC1, but this is unlikely to be a result of lower intracellular concentrations. Thus, for example, arginine uptake is in fact increased in cells completely starved of all amino acids compared to the cells incubated with complete amino acids, presumably due to a lack of competition for transport into the cell (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). mTORC1 activity induced by a combination of arginine, leucine, and glutamine is minimal compared to that of a complete set of amino acids; however, it is not further enhanced by the addition of any other individual amino acid, such as isoleucine (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H</a> and data not shown).

Indeed, we observed that upon arginine starvation and recovery, arginine uptake is rapid and intracellular concentrations of arginine recover to steady state levels within 15 min of arginine re-addition. Within this same time frame, there were no changes in metabolites associated with arginine metabolism such as ornithine, citrulline, arginosuccinate, or fumarate indicating that arginine remains intact during this period (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>).

First, deprivation of arginine but not leucine or isoleucine, significantly perturbed the growth factor-dependent input into mTORC1. This is evident from suppressed phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ULK1, with a concomitant increase in autophagy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013D</a>). Deprivation of arginine in the presence of growth factors limits mTORC1 activation to a level similar to that resulting from serum starvation. Addition of growth factors to leucine or isoleucine-deprived cells, however, permits maximal mTORC1 activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013D</a>). Amino acids, particularly leucine, are known to signal to mTORC1 via the V-ATPase/Ragulator/Rag GTPase protein complexes and have been comprehensively demonstrated to control mTORC1 localization to the lysosome and its activity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carroll et al., 2014</a>). We observed that arginine did not affect mTOR localization in any cell line tested. While complete amino acid starvation and, to a lesser extent, leucine starvation, caused redistribution of mTORC1 to the cytoplasm, arginine deprivation led to a strong suppression of mTORC1 without a significant reduction in co-localization of mTOR with the lysosomal marker Lamp1 in HeLa, MEFs, and HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Furthermore, overexpression of constitutively active Rag heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sancak et al., 2008</a>) did not completely rescue the effect of arginine starvation in the absence or presence of growth factors, thus suggesting that arginine may affect mTORC1 both via Rag-dependent and Rag-independent mechanisms (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E,F</a>). Finally, the knockdown of membrane transporter, SLC38A9 that has recently been implicated in Rag GTPase-dependent lysosomal recruitment and activation of mTORC1 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rebsamen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jung et al., 2015</a>) did partially perturb the recovery of mTORC1 following arginine starvation; however, there was no effect on the response of mTORC1 to arginine starvation either in the absence or presence of growth factors (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3G</a>)."

(<b>B</b>) HeLa cells were subjected to arginine starvation followed by re-addition of arginine as indicated. Cells were lysed and subject to LC-MS to analyze the intracellular levels of arginine and its metabolites, ornithine, citrulline, arginosuccinate and fumarate. No metabolites were significantly affected by starvation and recovery of arginine. (<b>C</b>) HeLa cells were incubated with labeled arginine (13C6, 15N4) for 2\u00a0hr either in the presence or absence of compounds as indicated (L-norvaline, ADMA ,and L-citrulline). Cells were treated with siRNA against arginyl-tRNA synthetase for 96\u2009hr prior to incubation with labeled arginine. Graphs indicate that negligible amounts of arginine are converted to these metabolites during the 2-hr period studied here suggesting that metabolism of arginine in these cells is slow. (<b><b>D</b>)</b> HeLa cells were starved of arginine in the presence or absence of cycloheximide for 2 hr. Cell lysates were immunoblotted for phosphorylation of S6K. (<b>E</b>) HeLa cells transfected with control or arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RARS) siRNA for 96\u2009hr were starved of arginine as indicated. Cell lysates were immunoblotted for phosphorylation of S6K. Note that both knockdown of RARS which would increase concentrations of free arginine and cycloheximide treatment which would increase concentration of intracellular amino acids by preventing their incorporation into newly synthesized proteins, increased mTOR activity, suggesting that preventing the use of arginine during protein translation promotes activation of mTORC1. (<b>F</b>) Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by ADMA did not impair the ability of arginine to rescue starvation-induced mTOR inactivation suggesting this pathway is not required for arginine-dependent regulation of mTORC1 activity. (<b>G\u2013J</b>) Treatment with arginase inhibitors (L-citrulline (<b>G</b>) and L-norvaline (<b>J</b>)) (<a href=\"#bib17\">El-Bassossy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hunter and Downs, 1945</a>) for 2 hr did not suppress activation of mTORC1 by arginine suggesting that metabolism of arginine to L-ornithine is not required for its effect on mTORC1 pathway. Note that exogenous L-citrulline, supplemented to the cells can be efficiently metabolised into arginosuccinate (<b>H</b>) and that in the presence of L-norvaline, intracellular levels of ornithine are decreased (<b>I</b>). Moreover, L-norvaline increased mTORC1 signaling, supporting the idea that by preventing arginine metabolism and increasing its levels one can enhance activity of mTORC1. These data together suggest that arginine molecules themselves participate in mTORC1 regulation as treatments that cause an increase in intracellular arginine concentration (e.g. by suppression of protein translation and inhibition of arginase) lead to increased mTORC1 activity, while arginine metabolism is not required for mTORC1.

Upstream signaling events from growth factors via PI3K-Akt to TSC are not affected by deprivation of arginine (or complete amino acid or leucine), as assessed by Akt phosphorylation at both threonine 308 and serine 473 and downstream phosphorylation of TSC2 at serine 939 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3H\u2013K</a>). Similarly, arginine starvation is unlikely to suppress mTORC1 via activation AMPK, as neither in HeLa cells, where this pathway has low activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Corradetti et al., 2004</a>), nor in MEFs did we observe any increase in AMPK phosphorylation in response to arginine, leucine or complete amino acid withdrawal (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3L,M</a>). The loss of <i>TSC2</i>, however, did render MEFs insensitive to arginine (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3N,O</a>), suggesting that arginine contributes to mTORC1 activity at the level of TSC. At the same time, sensitivity to leucine and complete amino acid starvation was preserved in <i>TSC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3N,O</a>) in agreement with the idea that they are activating mTORC1 via other mechanisms such as Rag-dependent mTOR localization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

                                "text": "Dynamic changes in TSC localization to lysosomes have been shown to control mTORC1 activity; however, it remains controversial whether it is regulated by growth factors or amino acids (<a href=\"#bib13\">Demetriades et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Menon et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, we next investigated whether arginine could be involved in this process. In normal growth conditions, TSC2 was found in a diffuse pattern within both HeLa and MEF cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>). While serum starvation or arginine deprivation in the presence of dialyzed serum moderately promoted TSC2 localization to the lysosomal compartment, simultaneous starvation of arginine and growth factors resulted in an additive effect leading to very strong recruitment of TSC2 to Rab7- and Lamp1-positive late endosomal and lysosomal structures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), which also correlates with a robust impairment of mTORC1 activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A</a>). Recruitment of TSC2 to lysosomes was confirmed to be specific and no significant localization of TSC2 to other cellular organelles such as mitochondria, Golgi, or peroxisomes was observed (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013F</a>;\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib68\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>]). The effect of arginine is similar to that of all amino acids, while leucine did not influence lysosomal localization of TSC2 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). Replenishment of amino acids or arginine following starvation caused re-distribution of TSC2 to the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). Furthermore, the addition of arginine but not leucine to cells starved of all amino acids was sufficient to cause significant re-distribution of TSC2 to the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>), demonstrating that arginine acts as a specific inhibitor of TSC2 recruitment to lysosomes. We further confirmed these immunofluorescence observations by lysosomal fractionation (enrichment of lysosomes was determined by western blot for multiple membrane and soluble proteins\u00a0[<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2G\u2013H</a>]). Indeed, TSC2 was found to strongly accumulate upon a combination of serum and arginine (or all amino acid) starvation and, to a lesser extent, upon removal of a single stimulus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The amount of Rheb in lysosomal fractions was not significantly affected by our starvation protocols (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>), suggesting that changes in localization of TSC in response to arginine may regulate Rheb function on lysosomes."

In our system, we confirmed the central importance of Rheb in this process (<a href=\"#bib45\">Menon et al., 2014</a>) by demonstrating that Rheb knock-down or inhibition of Rheb farnesylation (and therefore its membrane recruitment) completely prevented the arginine and growth factor starvation-induced re-localization of TSC2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, as reported before (<a href=\"#bib13\">Demetriades et al., 2014</a>), we also found that expression of the dominant negative Rag constructs partially reduced lysosomal localization of TSC2 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Consistent with its role in regulating mTORC1 via Rag GTPases, knock-down of SLC38A9 had a mild effect on TSC2 re-localization (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). Furthermore, we tested whether mTOR itself is required for TSC recruitment to lysosomes. Knock-down of mTOR suppressed recruitment of TSC2 to lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013H</a>). At the same time, rapamycin did not affect TSC2 recruitment suggesting that the activity of mTORC1 is not required for this translocation event (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). As knockdown or hyperactivation of Rheb did not affect either total mTOR protein levels or lysosomal localization of mTOR (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>, also see [<a href=\"#bib50\">Sancak et al., 2010</a>]), Rheb-dependent recruitment of TSC2 is unlikely to be indirectly mediated by perturbed mTOR localization. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that interaction with Rheb is the main mechanism of TSC2 recruitment to lysosomes but, in addition, the integrity of a larger lysosomal protein complex, including mTORC1 and Rag GTPases (<a href=\"#bib13\">Demetriades et al., 2014</a>), is also important, possibly indirectly by regulating Rheb activity, localization or availability."

It was not clear, however, whether this interference was occurring at the surface of the lysosome. To investigate this, TSC2 was constitutively targeted to the cytoplasmic surface of lysosomes by a p18-derived lysosomal targeting signal (<a href=\"#bib45\">Menon et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Interestingly, inactivation of mTORC1 signaling by either wild-type or constitutively lysosomal TSC2 was found to be suppressed by arginine (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This suggests that arginine interferes with Rheb-TSC2 interaction irrespective of lysosomal recruitment. To test this, we performed pull-down assays where immunoprecipitated Flag-Rheb was incubated with lysates of cells expressing V5-TSC2 and subjected to serum and amino acid starvation protocols (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In agreement with inhibition of Rheb-TSC2 interaction by arginine, deprivation of arginine but not leucine promoted strong binding of TSC2 to Rheb (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Moreover, an interaction of TSC2 (immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells) with recombinant GST-Rheb in vitro was perturbed by the addition of physiological concentrations of arginine (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). These findings do not preclude an indirect effect of arginine via a putative sensor co-immunoprecipitated with TSC2; however, it strongly supports the role of arginine in regulating Rheb-TSC2 interaction. In agreement with binding assays, arginine also reduced the ability of TSC2 to promote hydrolysis of Rheb-bound GTP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>)."

In agreement with this idea, the increased binding of TSC to Rheb is at the expense of the interaction between Rheb and mTOR (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>), which would render mTORC1 inactive and explain severe inhibition of its activity seen in complete starvation conditions."

While the role of leucine, together with glutamine, in Rag-dependent activation of mTORC1 has been the subject of intense investigations, the role of arginine in mTORC1 activation has remained relatively understudied. Arginine can contribute to mTORC1 activity via the canonical amino acid sensing, Ragulator/Rag signaling pathway via the recently characterized low-affinity amino acid transporter SLC38A9 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rebsamen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jung et al., 2015</a>). Our data suggest that arginine also works via the parallel, TSC2-Rheb signaling axis upstream of mTORC1 and stimulation of both inputs is required for the maximal activation of this signaling pathway (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In particular, we show that arginine cooperates with growth factors and acts as a permissive factor for their activation of mTORC1. Growth factors and arginine interfere with the TSC2-Rheb interaction; while Akt-mediated growth factor signaling phosphorylates TSC2, arginine does not affect phosphorylation of Akt, at least on the sites tested in this study. Instead, arginine appears to act as an intact molecule at a site more proximal to the TSC2-Rheb interaction, whether acting directly or via a putative sensor molecule."

Our measurements of TSC2 localization and nucleotide loading of Rheb help to explain this mechanistically. We propose that in response to serum or arginine starvation TSC2 transiently interacts with Rheb in a GTP-bound conformation on the surface of lysosomes promoting its GTPase activity. However, due to high basal GTP levels of Rheb (<a href=\"#bib38\">Li et al., 2004</a>), the GAP activity of TSC2 is not sufficient for complete GTP hydrolysis to GDP leaving a substantial fraction of Rheb in a GTP-bound state. This residual-active GTP-bound Rheb allows for the low level of mTORC1 activation in conditions of serum or arginine starvation. On the other hand, deprivation of both stimuli results in a complete suppression of mTORC1 activity, which is associated with a stable interaction of TSC with Rheb on lysosomes. This complex formation serves to sequester Rheb and to prevent its interaction with mTORC1 and its activation. By regulating Rheb-TSC2 interaction, arginine acts as a switch for upstream signaling inputs from growth factors."

Our findings begin to reconcile these differences by identifying that amino acids (specifically arginine) cooperate with growth factors to fine tune the spatial and temporal regulation of TSC and therefore mTORC1. We show that both arginine and growth factors suppress strong recruitment of TSC2 to lysosomes by interfering with stable TSC2-Rheb interaction as described by <a href=\"#bib45\">Menon et al.

The fact that mTORC1 sensitivity to leucine is acquired only after differentiation might reflect the need to integrate an increased complexity of extracellular stimuli to mTORC1. Arginine is an essential amino acid during embryogenesis which is a period of active growth and proliferation largely driven by mTORC1 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hentges et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">2013</a>), and we speculate that this underlies the dependence of mTORC1 on this amino acid. Growth-promoting signals in the absence of arginine would lead to defective protein synthesis, which would explain the need for coordination between growth factor and arginine availability. We acknowledge, however, that other, arginine-independent molecular mechanisms contribute to mTORC1 regulation, and, together, these serve to provide extremely tight spatial and temporal regulation of mTORC1 signaling in response to nutrients. Indeed, while arginine, leucine, and glutamine are sufficient for mTORC1 signaling, the level of activation achieved by these amino acids is very low compared to an entire set of free amino acids.

Briefly, hESC colonies were harvested using 1\u00a0mg/ml collagenase type IV, separated from the MEF feeder cells by gravity, gently triturated and cultured for 10 days in low-adherent suspension culture plates in fibroblast medium containing 20% FBS to form EBs. EBs were subsequently plated onto adherent tissue culture dishes and passaged according to primary fibroblast protocols using trypsin for at least four passages."

First, the percentage of cells with punctate mTOR or TSC2 (as a proxy for membrane localization of these proteins) was blindly scored. &gt;300 cells were counted per slide and quantification is based on at least three independent experiments unless otherwise stated. Second, confocal images were collected and the co-localization plug-in in ImageJ was used to measure the co-localization between mTOR or TSC2 and the lysosomal protein Lamp1. A constant threshold was applied to all the images in the z-stack, and for every image within each experiment. Following application of the co-localization plug-in, all channels were projected (max) and quantified using Analyse particle plugin (particles 5 pixels and above were included). The data were expressed as a percentage of mTOR or TSC2 that co-localized with Lamp1. Quantification was carried out on 20\u201340 cells per condition from at three independent experiments. Quantification of immunoblots was carried out using ImageJ software (NIH). Two-tailed, unpaired Student\u2019s t-tests were carried out on experimental data from at least three individual experiments."

Apologies but we were unable to find a suitable positive control for the knock down of SLC38A9 in the literature. The efficiency of knock-down is similar to that reported by Sabatini and Superti-Furga groups and we confirm their previous findings that knock-down of SLC38A9 leads to a significant delay in recovery following amino acid (specifically arginine) starvation and re-addition (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3G</a> panel 1, left hand side). Both groups show SLC38A9 as a critical component of the Ragulator-Rag amino acid sensing pathway and Guan\u2019s group have shown similar kinetics of mTORC1 perturbation in Rag knock-out MEFs characterised by a significant delay and dampening in recovery of mTORC1 activity following re-addition of amino acids (Jewell et al, Science, 2015). It is not clear from either Sabatini or Superti-Furga reports whether basal levels of mTORC1 are affected by SLC38A9. Our data would suggest mTORC1 is still active in basal conditions in SLC38A9 depleted cells (similar to Rag KO MEFs (Jewell et al, Science, 2015)). Furthermore, in support of both previous papers, we find that mTORC1 is effectively inhibited upon amino acid removal, i.e. there is no defect in sensing loss of amino acids."
