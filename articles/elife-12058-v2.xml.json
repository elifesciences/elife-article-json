How these molecules are delivered to the sensory cilium and whether they rely on one another for specific transport remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether the visual pigment, rhodopsin, is critical for delivering other signaling proteins to the sensory cilium of photoreceptor cells, the outer segment. Rhodopsin is the most abundant outer segment protein and its proper transport is essential for formation of this organelle, suggesting that such a dependency might exist. Indeed, we demonstrated that guanylate cyclase-1, producing the cGMP second messenger in photoreceptors, requires rhodopsin for intracellular stability and outer segment delivery. We elucidated this dependency by showing that guanylate cyclase-1 is a novel rhodopsin-binding protein. These findings expand rhodopsin\u2019s role in vision from being a visual pigment and major outer segment building block to directing trafficking of another key signaling protein."

How these molecules are delivered to the sensory cilium and whether they rely on one another for specific transport remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether the visual pigment, rhodopsin, is critical for delivering other signaling proteins to the sensory cilium of photoreceptor cells, the outer segment. Rhodopsin is the most abundant outer segment protein and its proper transport is essential for formation of this organelle, suggesting that such a dependency might exist. Indeed, we demonstrated that guanylate cyclase-1, producing the cGMP second messenger in photoreceptors, requires rhodopsin for intracellular stability and outer segment delivery. We elucidated this dependency by showing that guanylate cyclase-1 is a novel rhodopsin-binding protein. These findings expand rhodopsin\u2019s role in vision from being a visual pigment and major outer segment building block to directing trafficking of another key signaling protein."

This transformation takes place in the sensory cilium organelle, the outer segment. Outer segments are built from a relatively small set of structural and signaling proteins, including components of the classical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) phototransduction cascade. Such a distinct functional and morphological specialization allow outer segments to serve as a nearly unmatched model system for studying general principles of GPCR signaling (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arshavsky et al., 2002</a>) and, in more recent years, a model for ciliary trafficking (<a href=\"#bib11\">Garcia-Gonzalo and Reiter, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Nemet et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Pearring et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Schou et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wang and Deretic, 2014</a>)."

Indeed, nearly all mechanistic studies of outer segment protein trafficking have been devoted to rhodopsin (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nemet et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wang and Deretic, 2014</a>), which is a GPCR visual pigment comprising the majority of the outer segment membrane protein mass (<a href=\"#bib25\">Palczewski, 2006</a>). The mechanisms responsible for outer segment delivery of other transmembrane proteins remain essentially unknown. Some of them contain short outer segment targeting signals, which can be identified through site-specific mutagenesis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deretic et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Pearring et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Salinas et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sung et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Tam et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">2004</a>). A documented exception is retinal guanylate\u00a0cyclase\u00a01\u00a0(GC-1), whose exhaustive mutagenesis did not yield a distinct outer segment targeting motif (<a href=\"#bib16\">Karan et al., 2011</a>)."

GC-1 knockout in mice is characterized by severe degeneration of cones and abnormal light-response recovery kinetics in rods (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yang et al., 1999</a>). Furthermore, a very large number of GC-1 mutations found in human patients causes one of the most severe forms of early onset retinal dystrophy, called Leber\u2019s congenital amaurosis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boye, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kitiratschky et al., 2008</a>).

We conducted a comprehensive screen of outer segment protein localization in rod photoreceptors of rhodopsin knockout (<i>Rho<sup>-/-</sup></i>) mice and found that GC-1 was the only protein severely affected by this knockout. Next, we showed that this unique property of GC-1 is explained by its interaction with rhodopsin, which likely initiates in the biosynthetic membranes and supports both intracellular stability and outer segment delivery of this enzyme. These findings explain how GC-1 reaches its specific intracellular destination and also expand the role of rhodopsin in supporting normal vision by showing that it guides trafficking of another key phototransduction protein."

Normal outer segments are cylindrical structures filled with an ordered stack of several hundred membrane discs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Two chimeras were generated by exchanging the seven-helical cores and C-terminal sequences between rhodopsin and another GPCR, serotonin receptor Htr6, whose topology is close to rhodopsin. Although this receptor is not endogenous to rods, we found that both full-length Htr6 and its rhodopsin chimeras robustly express and reliably target to rod outer segments of WT and <i>Rho<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice.

The experiment in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> demonstrates that a large fraction of GC-1 can be co-precipitated with rhodopsin using the monoclonal anti-rhodopsin antibody 1D4. The specificity of this co-precipitation was established by replacing 1D4 with non-immune mouse IgG and by performing the experiment in the presence of the 1D4 epitope-blocking peptide (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hodges et al., 1988</a>). Neither rhodopsin nor GC-1 was precipitated under these conditions. We also probed the 1D4 precipitate for the chaperone protein, DnaJB6 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), which was previously shown to link GC-1 to the intraflagellar transport (IFT) particle for ciliary transport (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhowmick et al., 2009</a>). Whereas a strong DnaJB6 staining was identified in the retinal lysate, it did not precipitate with the rhodopsin-GC-1 complex. This suggests that, unlike the interaction with rhodopsin, the GC-1 interaction with DnaJB6 is transient. Following a recent report that another rhodopsin-binding protein is peripherin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Becirovic et al., 2014</a>), we also probed the rhodopsin precipitate for peripherin. However, no appreciable fraction of peripherin was found in precipitate, both under our experimental conditions and in membranes dissolved in Triton X-100 as in their study. Given that these authors did not show what fraction of total peripherin was precipitating with rhodopsin in their assays, it is hard to fully reconcile these observations, although it is highly unlikely that rhodopsin\u2019s interaction with peripherin could be as prominent as that with GC-1."

The challenge of this experiment was that rhodopsin in mouse rods is expressed at a 1400-fold molar excess over GC-1 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Peshenko et al., 2011b</a>). Therefore, the theoretical limit of rhodopsin bound to GC-1 is only 0.07% of its total amount, and its detection requires special measures to reduce non-specific rhodopsin binding to the beads. We addressed this issue by employing two strategies. First, we improved the molar ratio between GC-1 and rhodopsin by using retinal lysates from <i>Rho<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice, which express twice less rhodopsin without affecting the amounts of other outer segment proteins (<a href=\"#bib7\">Calvert et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Liang et al., 2004</a>). Second, we used a minimal amount of beads fully saturated with anti-GC-1 antibodies, just sufficient to precipitate the majority of GC-1 in the lysate. Under these conditions, rhodopsin precipitation with anti-GC-1 antibody exceeded non-specific background with non-immune IgG by over six-fold (6.5 \u00b1 1.7, n=3)."

This previously unknown function adds to the well-established roles of rhodopsin as a GPCR visual pigment and a major building block of photoreceptor membranes. We further showed that GC-1 is unique in its reliance on rhodopsin, as the other nine proteins tested in this study were expressed in significant amounts and faithfully localized to rod outer segments in the absence of rhodopsin."

Our study shows that GC-1 delivery requires rhodopsin and, therefore, can rely on specific targeting information encoded in the rhodopsin molecule. Interestingly, we also found that this information can be replaced by an alternative ciliary targeting sequence from a GPCR not endogenous to photoreceptors. This suggests that the functions of binding/stabilization of GC-1 and ciliary targeting are performed by different parts of the rhodopsin molecule."

The authors hypothesized that GC-1 plays a primary role in assembling cargo for the IFT particle bound for ciliary delivery. Our data suggest that it is rhodopsin that drives this complex, at least in photoreceptor cells where these proteins are specifically expressed. Unlike GC-1\u2019s reliance on rhodopsin for its intracellular stability or outer segment trafficking, rhodopsin does not require GC-1 as its expression level and localization remain normal in rods of GC-1 knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baehr et al., 2007</a>; and this study). The outer segment trafficking of cone opsins is not affected by the lack of GC-1 either (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baehr et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Karan et al., 2008</a>), although GC-1 knockout cones undergo rapid degeneration, likely because they do not express GC-2 \u2013 an enzyme with redundant function. The primary role of rhodopsin in guiding GC-1 to the outer segment is further consistent with rhodopsin directly interacting with IFT20, a mobile component of the IFT complex responsible for recruiting IFT cargo at the Golgi network (<a href=\"#bib8\">Crouse et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Keady et al., 2011</a>)."

In contrast, the majority of GC-1 co-precipitates with rhodopsin from these same lysates, suggesting that these proteins remain in a complex after being delivered to the outer segment.

This strikes at the difference between the composition of cellular components supporting membrane protein stabilization and transport in cell culture models versus functional photoreceptors.

The pRho plasmid driving gene expression under the 2.2 kb bovine rhodopsin promoter was a gift from Connie Cepko (Addgene,\u00a0Cambridge, MA; plasmid # 11156). All DNA constructs were cloned between the 5\u2019 AgeI and 3\u2019 NotI sites in pRho. Full-length mouse rhodopsin and peripherin were cloned from mouse retinal cDNA. A single N-terminal FLAG tag was added to the 5\u2019 end of rhodopsin using overlap extension PCR. The 5-Htr6 serotonin receptor was amplified from a mouse brain cDNA library (Stratagene,\u00a0La Jolla,\u00a0CA) and the coding sequence for eGFP was fused to its 3\u2019 end. All chimeric constructs were produced using overlap extension PCR. Rhodopsin was split at amino acid 323, 5-Htr6 was split at amino acid 322, and the C-terminal 63 amino acids from peripherin were used in the chimera with truncated rhodopsin. Each DNA plasmid (4 \u03bcg/\u03bcl) was mixed with a construct expressing soluble mCherry (2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl) for fluorescent identification of electroporated retinal patches. At least four animals yielding consistent results were analyzed for each construct."

Moreover, GC1 was found to directly interact with rhodopsin, thus suggesting the mechanism for rhodopsin in the transport of GC1.

We think, however, that our detergent result argues that rhodopsin-GC1 complex is de-stabilized rather than stabilized by detergent, as the complex was readily breaking apart when the concentration of a very mild detergent, dodecyl maltoside, was increased from a low value (0.1%) to the levels at which this detergent is used in the majority of published studies. We addressed this concern by replacing \u201cindicating\u201d with \u201csuggesting\u201d in the paragraph outlining this logic. Regarding FRET or proximity ligation assay, we thought about these options, but unfortunately they do not apply to the conditions of outer segment membranes containing 6 mM rhodopsin. This concentration is so high that rhodopsin is always within the FRET or PLA distance to other proteins populating these membranes, regardless of whether they are in a proper complex."
