These cycles involve dramatic but poorly understood mechanisms of dynamic physiological regulation at the level of gene expression. Each cycle, Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) drives periodic arousal from torpor by generating essential heat. We applied digital transcriptome analysis to precisely timed samples to identify molecular pathways that underlie the intense activity cycles of hibernator BAT. A cohort of transcripts increased during torpor, paradoxical because transcription effectively ceases at these low temperatures. We show that this increase occurs not by elevated transcription but rather by enhanced stabilization associated with maintenance and/or extension of long poly(A) tails. Mathematical modeling further supports a temperature-sensitive mechanism to protect a subset of transcripts from ongoing bulk degradation instead of increased transcription. This subset was enriched in a C-rich motif and genes required for BAT activation, suggesting a model and mechanism to prioritize translation of key proteins for thermogenesis."

These cycles involve dramatic but poorly understood mechanisms of dynamic physiological regulation at the level of gene expression. Each cycle, Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) drives periodic arousal from torpor by generating essential heat. We applied digital transcriptome analysis to precisely timed samples to identify molecular pathways that underlie the intense activity cycles of hibernator BAT. A cohort of transcripts increased during torpor, paradoxical because transcription effectively ceases at these low temperatures. We show that this increase occurs not by elevated transcription but rather by enhanced stabilization associated with maintenance and/or extension of long poly(A) tails. Mathematical modeling further supports a temperature-sensitive mechanism to protect a subset of transcripts from ongoing bulk degradation instead of increased transcription. This subset was enriched in a C-rich motif and genes required for BAT activation, suggesting a model and mechanism to prioritize translation of key proteins for thermogenesis."

However, hibernating mammals cannot remain in this state continuously over the months of hibernation but instead cycle between bouts of torpor lasting for 1\u20133 weeks and brief periods of \u2018arousal\u2019 lasting between 12\u201324 hr, during which their body rapidly warms up."

During the low body temperatures experienced during torpor, both of these processes stop. So how is the hibernator able to quickly and efficiently heat itself up during the arousal periods of hibernation?"

Once the animal warms up during arousal, gene transcription is reactivated and more new mRNA molecules are made."

Whether this protective mechanism is also used in other tissues during torpor remains a question for future work."

As winter approaches in temperate climates, hibernators enter into a state of torpor. Torpor in ground squirrels involves active suppression of physiological processes to 2\u20135% of basal rates, which allows body temperature to lower to just above ambient, even as ambient temperatures fall to near freezing. This depressed state is not continuous throughout winter, however, instead it lasts for 1\u20133 weeks until it is punctuated by a spontaneous, rapid re-warming to 37\u00b0C; physiological rates during re-warming match or even exceed basal rates. The interbout arousal period is then sustained for 12\u201324 hr before torpor resumes. Cycles between torpor and arousal result in winter heterothermy or hibernation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Hibernation persists for 5\u20138 months before emergence in spring and maintenance of more typical mammalian homeostatic physiology throughout the summer period of growth and reproduction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, see <a href=\"#bib12\">Carey et al., 2003</a>; for review). Although of broad medical interest for their ability to tolerate these extraordinary physiological extremes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carey et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andrews, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dave et al., 2012</a>), many aspects of the hibernation phenotype remain poorly understood. Some of hibernation's most defining mysteries are the mechanisms that underlie the highly dynamic oscillations of the torpor\u2013arousal cycle."

While the general consensus is that the transcriptome is largely stable during torpor (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib51\">Tessier and Storey (2014)</a>), this view is based upon results (<a href=\"#bib19\">Frerichs et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">O'Hara et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Knight et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Williams et al., 2005</a>) where ongoing degradation is not readily distinguishable from a stable transcriptome because of the sampling and normalization strategies employed. There are few clear examples of transcripts that diminish across a torpor bout (<a href=\"#bib17\">Epperson and Martin, 2002</a>) and others that appear to increase (<a href=\"#bib37\">O'Hara et al., 1999</a>), largely because few studies provide the necessary temporal resolution to quantify changes across a torpor bout."

These transcripts were largely bearing long poly(A) tails, which also appeared to shorten during torpor (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Class I dynamics explain the DIANA Clusters 1\u20133, where RNA decreased during torpor but then increased at the elevated body temperature of interbout arousal (compare IBA to LT in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), and likely the even larger collection of transcripts that were not differentially expressed (e.g., <i>GAPDH</i>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

For this simulated population, the abundance of each RNA transcript was governed by a differential equation describing temperature-dependent rates of RNA synthesis and degradation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</a>). To model RNA transcript dynamics across the torpor\u2013arousal cycle (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we introduced a representative 12-day body temperature profile, incorporating temperature-dependence into the rates of RNA synthesis and degradation based on Q10 effects (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burka, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Breukelen and Martin, 2002</a>), as described in detail in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>."

We found that a temperature-dependent mechanism that protected a subset of transcripts relative to bulk RNA degradation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>) was most consistent with the increased abundances observed experimentally. For a body temperature threshold of 10\u00b0C and degradation set to 3% of its rate in the warm animal, the relative abundance of the protected transcripts increased over twofold (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>), best reflecting the experimental data. This effect was dose-dependent with the level of protection and was relatively insensitive to thresholds above 10\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Although temperature-independent decreases in degradation rates also led to increases in the relative abundance of protected transcripts, this mechanism required implausible compensatory changes to either steady state RNA abundance or transcription rates in the warm animal (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Due to the differential Q10 effects on transcription and degradation, increasing transcription rate did not produce relative abundance increases (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, in agreement with RT-qPCR data, mathematical modeling supports enhanced stabilization of a subset of transcripts via a temperature-dependent protective mechanism; this, rather than increased transcription, leads to the observed increase in their relative abundances at the low body temperature of torpor."

This choice was validated by taking a random sampling of 3\u2032 UTR sequences in all clusters, which returned enrichment for a motif resembling the polyadenylation signal (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colgan and Manley, 1997</a>) when compared to a scrambled background set (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; [<a href=\"#bib4\">Bailey et al., 2009</a>]). To identify motifs unique to the protected RNA subset, the significantly changed transcripts were divided into two groups for comparison (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>): (1) the positive set of transcripts that appeared to be stabilized (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, DIANA Cluster 6) or increased in torpor (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, DIANA Clusters 4\u20135); and (2) the negative set of transcripts that appeared to decrease in torpor (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, DIANA Clusters 1\u20133). When the positive set was compared to the negative set, EXTREME (<a href=\"#bib41\">Quang and Xie, 2014</a>) identified two significantly enriched C-rich motifs (Motif 1 and 2, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Significantly, DIANA Cluster 5, comprised of the transcripts that most clearly increased in relative abundance from early to late in torpor, contained the greatest percentage of mRNAs with the two motifs (Motif 1: 59.1%; Motif 2: 66.7% of transcripts, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). DIANA Cluster 6, comprised of transcripts that remained elevated and stable across a torpor bout, contained a higher proportion of transcripts with Motif 2 (50.8%, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) relative to the other DIANA clusters (8.5\u201339.8%, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) and the control, non-significant transcripts (21.1%, NS in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Additionally, the other winter-increased DIANA Clusters, 3 and 4, were relatively enriched for these motifs as compared to the spring-increased DIANA Clusters 1 and 2 (38.4\u201343% vs 8.5\u201323.3%, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), suggesting that these motifs play a broader role in enhanced transcript stability and/or translation during winter heterothermy. Although the transcripts in DIANA Cluster 4 appeared elevated in early torpor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), their motif enrichment was similar to that of Cluster 3. In contrast to those in Clusters 5 and 6, these transcripts also appeared to largely degrade by late torpor (compare ET to LT, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>); hence their reduced motif enrichment is consistent with reduced transcript stability across a bout of torpor."

Dynamic polyadenylation has been demonstrated to control temporal and spatial regulation of translation in many systems (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kojima et al., 2012</a>), including maternal <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte maturation (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib55\">Vasudevan et al. [2006]</a>). Generally, poly(A) tail elongation causes translational activation, whereas shortening leads to silencing and/or RNA degradation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Weill et al., 2012</a>). Similar to oocyte maturation, in hibernation, the transcriptional machinery is silenced during the two week period of torpor; therefore, post-transcriptional mechanisms affecting mRNA stability and translation serve in the rapid switch between a hypo- and hyper-metabolic state in BAT. For instance, PNPLA2 catalyzes the first committed step in triacylglycerol hydrolysis, resulting in diacylglycerol and free fatty acid (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zimmermann et al., 2004</a>). Its increased translation via poly(A) tail lengthening in early arousal would ensure immediate generation of free fatty acids for thermogenesis, while poly(A) shortening during interbout arousal offers a parsimonious means to silence protein translation and lower free fatty acids as metabolic activity declines. Additionally, dynamic polyadenylation likely controls translation of the other Class IIA transcripts. Although there is currently no evidence for this type of mechanism operating in human BAT, our results suggest a potential therapeutic strategy by which translation of key proteins can be prioritized for recovery from metabolic repression, and more specifically, for rapid activation of thermogenesis in BAT."

Moreover, our findings are consistent with reports of mRNA degradation during torpor (<a href=\"#bib17\">Epperson and Martin, 2002</a>) and with global maintenance of poly(A) tails and their increased length (<a href=\"#bib30\">Knight et al., 2000</a>). These results also provide further explanation to histological observations, as RNP granules containing both ncRNAs and mRNAs are formed during torpor in BAT nucleoli (<a href=\"#bib34\">Malatesta et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Malatesta et al., 2011</a>). The Class II ncRNAs identified in our study are located in nucleoli, suggesting that sequestration into these RNP granules protects a subset of transcripts from the degradation affecting bulk BAT RNA, which is also consistent with the results of our mathematical modeling."

Intriguingly, PCBPs are involved in many aspects of post-transcriptional control that are consistent with our observations, including enhanced stability of long-lived mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Makeyev and Liebhaber, 2002</a>). Further roles include 3\u2032 end-processing and alternative polyadenylation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ji et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ji et al., 2013</a>), and the addition, maintenance (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 1999</a>), and elongation of poly(A) tails (<a href=\"#bib56\">Vishnu et al., 2011</a>). Finally, these proteins are involved in both translational silencing and enhancement (<a href=\"#bib33\">Makeyev and Liebhaber, 2002</a>). Although these roles are established for the predominantly studied PCBP1 and PCBP2, these paralogs were not detected in our dataset. Rather, we detected increased expression of <i>PCBP3</i> during winter heterothermy, a pattern that would be expected for a role involving enhanced mRNA stabilization and polyadenylation during torpor. Furthermore, <i>PCBP3's</i> pattern runs in contrast to most of the other RNA binding proteins detected in this dataset, which, if changed, were largely decreased during winter heterothermy (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, functional annotations for DIANA Clusters 1 and 2)."

The poly(A) binding protein PABP1 and the TIA-1/R RNA binding proteins were recently shown to localize to discrete sub-nuclear foci during torpor in the livers of 13-lined ground squirrels (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tessier et al., 2014</a>). PABP1 specifically binds to the poly(A) tails of transcripts, influencing their length as well as overall transcript translation and stability (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burgess and Gray, 2010</a>). Significantly, the PCBPs 1 and 2 functionally interact with PABP1 in order to prevent deadenylation and to maintain mRNA stability (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 1999</a>). While further research is needed to determine whether the protection identified here extends to other tissues during torpor and to thoroughly examine the role of PCBP3 or its homologs in this protection, our results of enhanced stabilization and polyadenylation for a subset of crucial transcripts suggest a mechanistic link to PABP1 observations in other organs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Knight et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tessier et al., 2014</a>).

While it is generally assumed that changes in steady-state mRNA levels stem from changes in the rate of transcription, varying the rate of degradation also changes steady-state levels; this phenomenon has been observed at both mRNA and protein levels in the cold acclimation of fish (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sidell, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bremer and Moyes, 2014</a>). Recently, the balance between mRNA synthesis and degradation rates was examined on a global scale in cultured mammalian cells, demonstrating complex gene-specific effects of transcription, processing, decay, and translation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rabani et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</a>). In our study, the modeling results shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> demonstrate that transcript-specific variability in the rate of degradation may cause a subset of transcripts to increase in relative abundance. These transcripts are degrading, but more slowly than most of the bulk transcripts and therefore exhibit a small increase in relative abundance across the torpor bout. Thus, many of the smaller fold changes observed in gene expression datasets from hibernators (<a href=\"#bib59\">Williams et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hampton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schwartz et al., 2013</a>) likely reflect intrinsic differences in the stability of specific mRNAs rather than specific mechanisms to regulate their transcription or decay. However, for changes greater than approximately twofold in a substantial number of transcripts, here \u223c3.5% of the total, a specific regulatory mechanism appears to be required. Furthermore, particularly large fold changes, as observed here with <i>RPPH1</i>, likely reflect the addition or lengthening of poly(A) tails."

Stabilization likely occurs by a temperature-dependent protective mechanism that is in place before body temperature reaches 5\u00b0C, such as PCPB3 binding to the 3\u2032 UTRs of protected transcripts, which then leads to their relative increase as torpor progresses. At the end of torpor and onset of arousal, the stabilized mRNA subset with the longest poly(A) tails is translated immediately as BAT temperature becomes permissive. As BAT temperature rises, further polyadenylation of the remaining stabilized RNAs facilitates their translation, transcription resumes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Osborne et al., 2004</a>), and, during interbout arousal, transcripts that were previously degraded during torpor are replenished to their baseline levels. This dynamic cycle of transcription, degradation, stabilization, and polyadenylation in BAT leads to translation of the correct transcripts at the correct time with minimal energy expenditure. Specifically: (1) energy intensive translation during early arousal is directed to proteins needed for BAT activation; (2) the cell is not dependent on de novo transcription at the onset of the short bursts of metabolic activity, which could delay thermogenesis and induce stress; (3) inhibition of translation via shortening of poly(A) tails while body temperature is high or begins to decline conserves energy compared to mRNA degradation and subsequent re-synthesis. Thus, given a general suppression of transcription by low body temperature during two-week torpor periods, stabilization and dynamic polyadenylation provide an alternative mechanism to prioritize transcripts for immediate translation when BAT metabolic activity rapidly resumes."

Resulting uniquely aligned nuclear reads were combined into read counts by tag position in the genome (requiring a minimum of 1 bp overlap). Poorly expressed tags were removed by converting the read counts into tags per million (TPM) counts for each library and requiring that at each tag position there will be a minimum of two TPM in <i>n</i>-1 samples in at least one sample group. The tags were annotated to their nearest known gene using the Ensembl annotations (.gtf, v. 71) or by homology to eutherian mammals in Ensembl; we required tags to be overlapping or within 3-kb downstream of the gene annotation to be considered annotated. Because we suspected that multiple, unannotated transcript isoforms of the same gene likely exist, tags that mapped to different positions within the same gene were not combined."

All biological samples were measured in triplicate using a standard curve specific for each transcript/primer set. Outlier measurements were removed and transcript abundance values were calculated for all biological samples using the mean of the technical replicates for each sample. To correct for sample loading inaccuracies using a method independent of normalization to a housekeeping gene (which assumes constant expression of that gene), we instead created a custom normalization factor for each biological sample based upon the sample's overall tendency to be higher or lower for transcript expression within its own respective sample group (e.g., within EAr <span class=\"underline\">or</span> within LT). We first calculated each transcript's fold change for a given sample relative to the median transcript abundance measurement within its respective sample group. We then created a normalization factor for each biological sample by calculating the mean of that sample's within-group transcript fold change across all transcripts. Each of the individual transcript abundance measurements were next divided by their respective sample's normalization factor. After normalization, transcripts were tested for significant expression changes among sample groups via one-way ANOVA (\u03b1 = 0.05) and for correlation with their corresponding EDGE-tag using a Spearman's rank correlation test."

Due to uncertainty in 3\u2032 UTR structure and length, we included only transcripts that contained significantly differentially expressed (D.E.) tags &lt;1 kb 3\u2032 to their nearest protein coding feature. First, the transcripts were divided by whether they fell into the \u2018torpor-increased\u2019 DIANA clusters 4\u20136 or \u2018torpor-decreased\u2019 DIANA clusters 1\u20133. Each transcript was counted only once; in cases where multiple tags mapped to the same transcript, the most 3\u2032 D.E. tag was used for assignment of the transcript to a particular cluster. Annotation of the 3\u2032 UTRs in the ground-squirrel genome is currently sparse and likely imprecise; thus, for each gene, we conservatively defined the \u20183\u2032 UTR\u2019 to be the 500-nt region immediately 3\u2032 to the stop codon. To identify enriched motifs, we used the motif discovery algorithm EXTREME (<a href=\"#bib41\">Quang and Xie, 2014</a>) with the default settings, except allowing 0 gaps, and with the 500-nt \u20183\u2032 UTR\u2019 sequences from \u2018torpor-increased\u2019 transcripts input as the positive set and the 500-nt \u20183\u2032 UTR\u2019 sequences from the \u2018torpor-decreased\u2019 transcripts input as the negative set. We considered resulting motifs with E values &lt;1 as significantly enriched in the positive set. The enriched motifs were used as input in the MAST tool (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bailey and Gribskov, 1998</a>) of MEME Suite (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bailey et al., 2009</a>), which counted the number of transcripts containing the motif (E-value &lt;10) within each DIANA cluster. As a control, we also counted the number of motif occurrences in the 500-nt \u20183\u2032UTRs\u2019 of 484 non-significant D.E. transcripts (q &gt; 0.97; 500 transcripts were originally chosen but 16 lacked 3\u2032 sequence data, hence 484 transcripts). Finally, to detect motifs enriched in all clusters, 3\u2032 UTR sequences from 20 randomly chosen transcripts in each cluster (120 total) were compared against a scrambled background set in MEME (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</a>), with the settings set at a maximum width of 8-nt and a search of the given strand only."

The authors performed RNA-Seq profiling of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in ground squirrels across different periods of the torpor-arousal cycle. Three major observations were made: (1) unsupervised clustering of the samples revealed three main groups\u2014spring, winter warm, and winter cold. Between these three groups, 1638 genes with significant differential steady-state transcript levels were detected. Gene ontology analysis identified processes associated with BAT function in the winter groups; (2) a subset of transcripts in the winter groups reached their highest abundance during early torpor, late torpor, and early arousal despite suppressed transcription rates at low body temperatures. RT-PCR analysis revealed two classes of transcripts during torpor: transcripts were either degraded and not replenished, or they were stabilized by the maintenance or acquisition of a long poly(A) tail; (3) the authors propose a mathematical model to describe the changes in transcription rates and degradation could affect differential gene expression in torpor. A temperature-dependent mechanism was identified that protected a subset of transcripts relative to bulk RNA degradation."

In particular, how certain transcripts are activated/maintained despite suppressed transcription during low body temperatures is poorly understood. The findings in this study would appeal to those interested in hibernation dynamics, as well as those who study post-transcriptional regulation. While it is known that polyadenylation is important for mRNA stability, localization, and translation, the authors present evidence for the first time that this mechanism is implicated in the torpor-arousal cycle."

Although the suggested strategy of either CLIP or CLIP-Seq using antibodies to PABP1 or RBM3 might enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism involved, this is often not a trivial undertaking in ground squirrels in terms of identifying useful antibodies. We do not think that evidence for PABP1 binding would be particularly helpful because it is unlikely to provide the specificity needed to explain the selectivity among transcripts that is evident in our data. Before embarking on a potentially difficult search for an appropriate immunoprecipitating RBM3 antibody, we employed a motif-searching bioinformatics approach to see whether RBM3 binding sites were enriched in the protected transcript subset. Although neither of the two (worrisomely unrelated) RBM3 binding sites that have been reported by others are significantly enriched in our population of protected transcripts (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>), we believe that the motif searching strategy employed set us on a path that has proven to be extremely fruitful. Specifically, we detected two C-rich motifs that are significantly enriched in the 3\u2019 regions of the stabilized transcripts; these motifs were the only enriched motifs (see figure) and are predicted to be bound by a poly(C) binding protein (PCBP). Significantly, the mRNA expression for one of the PCBP family members, PCBP3, increased during the winter in our dataset, in contrast to most of the other RNA binding proteins that were differentially expressed. We document this motif and its link with PCBP3 in a new Figure in the manuscript (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and now suggest, based on the motif enrichment analysis, that a PCBP paralog, most likely PCBP3, may be mechanistically linked to the observed transcript stability. We believe this analysis adds significant mechanistic insight underlying mRNA stabilization and polyadenylation and paves the way for the next step, which would be to identify the RNAs that are bound by PCBP3 (or its paralogs) at different hibernation timepoints using CLIP-Seq. We would like to argue here, however, that such a next step is well beyond the scope of this study."

Thus, we do not think these tags should be viewed as a conclusive proxy for defining 3\u2019UTR\u2019s and poly(A) site usage. However, we do provide all tag locations within their respective transcripts in the supplementary tables, so that others doing poly(A)-Seq analysis on ground-squirrel transcripts can easily make such comparisons. Our observations of enhanced mRNA stabilization and polyadenylation during torpor were an unanticipated finding from the digital transcriptome data that were collected to identify differentially-expressed genes linked to the phenotypic dynamics of hibernation. Although in the process we have detected what we suspect are alternative polyadenylation sites, focusing on them here would detract from the main findings of this work."
