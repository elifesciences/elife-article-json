Here we aim to define the nature of the basal ganglia control signal for force and to decode gripping force based on local field potential (LFP) activities recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes. We found that STN LFP activities in the gamma (55\u201390 Hz) and beta (13\u201330m Hz) bands were most informative about gripping force, and that a first order dynamic linear model with these STN LFP features as inputs can be used to decode the temporal profile of gripping force. Our results enhance the understanding of how the basal ganglia control gripping force, and also suggest that deep brain LFPs could potentially be used to decode movement parameters related to force and movement vigour for the development of advanced human-machine interfaces."

Here we aim to define the nature of the basal ganglia control signal for force and to decode gripping force based on local field potential (LFP) activities recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes. We found that STN LFP activities in the gamma (55\u201390 Hz) and beta (13\u201330m Hz) bands were most informative about gripping force, and that a first order dynamic linear model with these STN LFP features as inputs can be used to decode the temporal profile of gripping force. Our results enhance the understanding of how the basal ganglia control gripping force, and also suggest that deep brain LFPs could potentially be used to decode movement parameters related to force and movement vigour for the development of advanced human-machine interfaces."

These patients move more slowly than healthy individuals and often struggle to grip objects with desired force, making it difficult to perform everyday tasks."

Neuronal recordings in monkeys and imaging studies in healthy humans have suggested that the basal ganglia play an important role in the control of the scaling of motor responses (<a href=\"#bib13\">DeLong et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Turner and Anderson, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Spraker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Vaillancourt et al., 2007</a>). Direct recordings from basal ganglia targets in patients suggest that changes in frequency specific activities in the local field potential (LFP) contribute to the selection of effort or force levels for voluntary movements. For example, the power over the gamma band (60\u201380 Hz) in the LFP in the globus pallidus correlates with the movement amplitude and velocity of the contralateral hand of patients with cranial dystonia (<a href=\"#bib7\">Br\u00fccke et al., 2012</a>). Similar correlations have been noted in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease between movement speed and the power in the gamma band in the LFP picked up from the STN (<a href=\"#bib26\">Joundi et al., 2012</a>). Our previous studies also showed that suppression in the beta band (13\u201330 Hz) and power increase in the gamma band of the STN LFP may correlate with forces or efforts made over the lower and higher effort ranges, respectively, in a manner independent from the effector that was activated (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tan et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2015</a>). These results suggest that the signals from basal ganglia may serve as a central signal indexing motor effort, which in turn modulates force in manual grips. However, most previous studies are based on static linear correlations and averaged data; the dynamic relationship between activities of different frequencies in the basal ganglia LFP and generated force, and whether this relationship can be used to decode gripping force based on basal ganglia LFP signals has not been investigated on a trial by trial basis."

We hypothesized that beta and gamma band activities will be the most informative features in predicting the force profile generated by the contralateral hand, and that a simple first order linear dynamic model is sufficient to capture the relationship between STN LFP features and generated force. Our results suggest that reciprocal changes in synchronised oscillatory population activity in different frequency ranges provide potential control signals for the motor plant, the action of which can be modelled as a first order linear dynamical system. At the same time our results raise the possibility of using the LFP signal recorded from deep brain structures to provide stable and high-performance control signals for BMI driven neuroprosthetic grasping in paralysed patients."

(<b>C</b>) In another group of electrodes (n\u00a0=\u00a09), significant simultaneous modulation was absent in the beta and gamma band with movement, and there was instead an increased power across the low frequency band during gripping. Trajectories of force (<b>D</b>) and force yank (<b>G</b>) for Group one show that the stable force during the holding phase (1\u20132 s after cue) as well as the peak force yank in the force initialisation phase scaled well with self-rated effort (SRE). In group 2, the stable force (<b>E</b>) and force yank (<b>H</b>) did not scale with effort as well as Group 1. Group two had significantly lower correlation coefficients between stable force and SRE (<b>F</b>) and between the\u00a0peak force yank and SRE (<b>I</b>) compared with group 1 (p&lt;0.0001), indicating some impairment in the scaling of force with effort. Time 0 indicates the onset of the cue to start a grip in <b>B\u2013E</b>,\u00a0<b>G</b>\u00a0and\u00a0<b>H</b>. Note that data from three electrodes are excluded. Of these, two had significant modulation in the beta band but not in the gamma band, and one had significant modulation in the gamma band, but not in the beta band."

There is a movement related gamma increase and beta power suppression in line with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cassidy et al., 2002</a>). This pattern is compared to the other group (n\u00a0=\u00a09) in which no significant movement-related modulation was observed in either the beta or gamma band in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>. In the latter group the mean spectrum demonstrated increased activity (synchronisation) at low frequencies, extending to 25 Hz, especially during the force onset phase. A\u00a0possible cause for this low frequency power increase at the time of movement onset, which then contaminated the beta band, is movement related artefact. The latter is overshadowed by beta band desynchronization in the recordings comprising <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>."

In the first group which showed modulation in the\u00a0beta and gamma band, the average force during the holding phase (1.0\u20132.0 s after cue) and the peak force yank in the force initialisation phase scaled with SRE in all individual hands. The Spearman correlation coefficient between stable force and SRE ranged between 0.6454 and 0.9728 (median value\u00a0=\u00a00.9409, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>); and the correlation coefficient between peak force yank and SRE ranged between 0.4514 and 0.9341 (median value\u00a0=\u00a00.8688, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). In the second group, the stable force did not scale with SRE, with abnormally increased force and force yank at lower effort levels, compared with the first group, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E and H</a>. The correlation coefficient between the stable force and self-rated effort in the second group (ranged between 0.0258 and 0.8334, median value\u00a0=\u00a00.6023) was significantly lower than in the first group (t(16)=5.386, p&lt;0.0001 with un-paired t-test applied to Fisher transformed r values, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The correlation coefficient between the peak force yank and SRE in the second group (ranged between \u22120.4992 and 0.6944, median value\u00a0=\u00a00.3791) was also significantly lower (t(16)=4.977, p=0.0001 with un-paired t-test applied to Fisher transformed r values). This difference in the scaling ability may account for some variations we observed in LFP reactivity. Thus, patients in the second group exhibited impairment in the scaling of force with effort. The lack of beta and gamma reactivity during gripping in this group would be consistent with a role for these activities in the coding of effort in to force. The deficit in the scaling of force with effort may be due to disease related differences between the groups, or due to the temporary post-surgical stun effect which may compromise STN function in some patients."

To achieve this, gripping force and LFPs measured from the contralateral STNr were grouped into low effort trials (with self-reported effort &lt;= 5, trial number = 15\u00b11) and high effort trials (with self-reported effort &gt; 5, trial number = 14\u00b11). Average STNr LFP features and force trajectories were calculated for each effort condition. The STNr LFP features and force for one effort condition were used to estimate the model parameters (model fitting), and the models were then used to predict force for the other effort condition (model testing). The within-trial correlation coefficients between the predicted force and measured force (WithinR) and the nRMSE of the predicted force from different models during model testing are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>. There was no significant difference consistent across the STNs between the three models using beta and gamma ERS as model inputs (<a href=\"#equ1\">Models 1\u20133</a>) in the predictive performance in terms of either WithinR or nRMSE. These three models with both beta and gamma activity as inputs performed better than models in which extra information about alpha activity was also included (<a href=\"#equ4\">Models 4,5</a>), or models with activities from a single frequency band as model input only (<a href=\"#equ6\">Models 6\u20138</a>). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> shows the BIC values combining the force prediction for low effort and high effort for all models. One-way repeated ANOVA identified a significant effect of models in the BIC (F(7,56)=11.777, p&lt;0.001).

In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, data averaged across low effort trials (with self-reported effort\u00a0&lt;=\u00a05) were used for the estimation of model parameters (model fitting). The predictive performance of the model was evaluated on the data averaged across high effort trials for the same STN (with self-reported effort\u00a0&gt;\u00a05, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> shows the fitting and predictive performance of the model on data from the other 8 STNr electrodes in which consistent movement-related power modulations in both the beta and the gamma band were observed. The correlation coefficient between the predicted force and the measured force across all STNs was between 0.902 and 0.987 with a\u00a0median value of 0.952 for high effort force (data during low effort used for model parameter estimation) and between 0.921 and 0.992 with a\u00a0median value of 0.969 for low effort force (data during high effort used for model parameter estimation). The nRMSE of the prediction force was between 5.60% and 28.07% with median value of 16.5% for high effort levels and between 10.5% and 23.8% with median value of 16.4% for low effort levels. The differences in reaction times (DifRT) between the predicted force and the measured force were 11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027 ms for high effort levels and \u221226\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031 ms for low effort levels. These were not significantly different from zero (t\u00a0=\u00a01.25, p=0.247 for high effort levels and t\u00a0=\u00a01.03, p=0.333 for low effort levels, one-sampled t-test compared to zero). The estimated Td ranged between 0 and 264 ms for low effort trials and ranged from 0 and 277 ms for high effort trials across STNs. Together, the results demonstrated that a simple first order linear dynamic model with beta and gamma as inputs with different linear gains can be used to describe the relationship between STNr activity change and measured force; and that, in addition, the model with parameters derived from one set of data can be used to predict force exerted at other effort levels in the same subject."

For half of all the individual trials (n = 21) recorded from this STN and contralateral hand, the within-trial correlation coefficient between the predicted force and measured force was equal or larger than 0.78. The actual measured stable force during the holding phase and the predicted stable force were then quantified for each individual trial (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> shows that the stable force during the holding phase varied from zero to 100% of the maximal voluntary force across all the trials. Linear correlation was applied to the actual measured stable force during the holding phase and the predicted stable force of all individual trials. This predicted stable force correlated with the measured stable force (n = 21, r = 0.815, p&lt;0.001), suggesting that the STNr LFP in conjunction with the dynamic model can predict both the force trajectory in individual trials and the stable force achieved across trials with different effort. The line of best fit between the predicted stable force and measured stable force was y = 0.96x + 2.4. The regression gradient close to unity suggests that the prediction matches well with the measurement with no systematic overestimation or underestimation. During one trial for this patient, there is a force increase predicted from the STNr LFP, but there is no actual measured force change in the dynamometer (indicated by ** in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This may be due to changes in the STNr LFP signal following the cue without the actual force change being registered in the dynamometer, as might arise when movements of the limb did not involve the dynamometer."

There was also a trend for better prediction of force with increasing movement related beta desynchronization, but linear regression fitting was not significant for either WithinR or StableR. If we assume that movement-related synchronisation in gamma activity upon gripping is a good proxy for proximity to the motor region of the STN (and perhaps the upper limb representation within it) then these findings suggest that the electrode has to be very near to this region if recorded activity is to have a decent prospect of force prediction. This assumption was borne out by the fact that the movement-related synchronisation in gamma activity dropped by 71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.7% from the bipolar channel showing the most movement-related modulation to the average modulation in the remaining two bipolar channels. This drop was not so acute, 59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9%, for movement related modulation in the beta band, which also only showed a trend for better prediction of force as movement related modulation in this band increased. Finally, there was a lack of significant correlation between the accuracy of the prediction of force and baseline beta (Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a00.468, p=0.13 for WithinR; Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a00.363, p=0.25 for StableR) or gamma activity (Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a00.281, p=0.37 for WithinR; Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a00.273, p=0.39 for StableR) measured during rest across subjects, suggesting that it is the reactivity of the power changes during gripping that is important for prediction, perhaps because it is more specific for the corresponding motor representation."

This is consistent with an earlier study which recorded neuronal ensemble activities from the STN in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, and which showed that a large population of STN neurons were modulated by gripping force (<a href=\"#bib33\">Patil et al., 2004</a>). Moreover, here we show that a simple first order linear dynamic model with the frequency-specific power change from the STN LFP as inputs is sufficient to capture the relationship between LFP signals and generated force, and can be used to decode the temporal profile of gripping force. This extends the earlier observation that frequency-specific LFP activities in the STN correlate with force-related variables in manual grips (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anzak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Tan et al., 2013</a>); and that beta and gamma activities can be considered complementary non-linear correlates of force in gripping, and when combined, afford a measure that linearly correlates with force across all effort levels. Compared to other more data-driven methods based on Wiener filter for decoding force (<a href=\"#bib21\">Flint et al., 2014</a>), the first order linear dynamic model proposed here simulates how the musculoskeletal plant responds to the control signal from the brain. This offers more insight in to how the basal ganglia encodes gripping force, and provides a framework to further investigate and explain the pathophysiology of motor impairment in Parkinson\u2019s disease. One further difference between the model proposed here and the Wiener filter based decoding algorithm is that the present model describes how the output from the musculoskeletal plant, i.e. the generated force, responds to the instantaneous change in the control input from the brain. This may lead to more noisy prediction in the plant output, but allows for fast behavioural reactivity in the face of movement perturbations, and therefore may represent a biologically more relevant control strategy."

Changes in beta activity also contributed to the prediction of the force profile and inclusion of beta activity improved the encoding accuracy. This is consistent with our previous finding that beta desynchronization can encode gripping force, especially at the low effort levels (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tan et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2015</a>). It is unlikely that the\u00a0predictive power of activities in the beta and gamma band was related to contamination by movement artefacts as we used bipolar LFPs for the decoding in which any common artefact is removed through common mode rejection. In addition, we observed increased activity in the low frequency (delta and alpha bands), but features extracted from these frequency bands deteriorated the decoding of force during our\u00a0core paradigm, even though separate parameters in a first order linear model were estimated for the low frequency activities. This contrasts with previous research which showed that the local motor potential and delta activity (0\u20134 Hz) in the LFP from the hand area of the primary motor cortex contains information about muscle activity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Flint et al., 2012</a>) and pinching force (<a href=\"#bib21\">Flint et al., 2014</a>)."

In this case, though, the additional incorporation of theta/alpha activity further improved the accuracy and reliability of the force prediction. This may relate to the focus on maximal voluntary contractions and their execution as fast as possible, placing additional attentional demands on the participants. Oscillatory activity in the theta/alpha range may be involved in attentional mechanisms (for review see <a href=\"#bib32\">Palva and Palva, 2007</a>). In particular, alpha activity (7\u201313 Hz) in the subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease is coherent with parieto-temporal cortical activity in a circuit that has been proposed to subserve attentional functions (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hirschmann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Litvak et al., 2011</a>). Another consideration is the potential for the predictive power of low frequency activities to be related to contamination by movement artefacts secondary to movement overflow during maximal contractions."

In line with this is the impaired effort scaling in subjects lacking beta and gamma related motor reactivity in the STN LFP. We speculate that the motor plant may behave as a first order linear dynamical system translating a basal ganglia effort signal to force for a given effector. The present analyses allow quantitative assessment of the importance of such a simple transfer function model of basal ganglia-motor function in terms of its remarkable ability to predict both the pattern with which force is developed and the static force achieved on a single trial basis. Note that although the\u00a0prediction is being used here in terms of its statistical meaning of accounting for the variance in a second signal, it also satisfies the physiological implications of this term in that changes in the STN LFP preceded changes in the measured force by about 200\u2013300 ms. Our quantitative approach also allowed us to demonstrate that effort encoding is relatively lateralised in the basal ganglia."

Such a diminished range of power modulation in the beta and gamma bands during movement may restrict the dynamic range of the coding of force in gripping in Parkinson\u2019s disease. This may impair the\u00a0force generation, and thereby cause bradykinesia, hypokinesia and weak movements when off compared to when on medication, presuming that the relationship between the STN force-encoding signal and generated force remains fixed across drug states (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This is consistent with previous observations that untreated PD patients produce normal muscle activation patterns, but that muscle activity is not adequately scaled to produce the required force (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berardelli et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Turner and Desmurget, 2010</a>), PD patients are weaker off dopaminergic medication or DBS (<a href=\"#bib12\">Corcos et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alberts et al., 2004</a>) and that PD patients show an increased probability of selecting slow movement speeds (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mazzoni et al., 2007</a>). On the other hand, if the range of the maximal force to be achieved is to be kept similar to normal when off medication, the scale between the STN force-encoding signal and gripping force will be steeper when untreated (as indicated by <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This will lead to abnormally high grip forces in Parkinsonian patients, as observed when they are asked to lift and hold an object (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fellows et al., 1998</a>). Increased force scaling can also lead to the\u00a0more coarse control of force and difficulty in finely tuning generated force. This is consistent with abnormally increased gripping force observed in precision grasping movements in Parkinson\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wenzelburger et al., 2002</a>)."

Surgical subcortical targets, such as the STN and globus pallidus (GPi), are involved in motor planning and execution. Activities from STN and GPi have been shown to correlate with movement parameters such as movement amplitude and speed (<a href=\"#bib7\">Br\u00fccke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Joundi et al., 2012</a>), and are also modulated by movement intention (<a href=\"#bib27\">K\u00fchn et al., 2006</a>). Basal ganglia output has been theorized to regulate movement gain in healthy motor control, and can contain important information about the\u00a0motor vigour (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Turner and Desmurget, 2010</a>). Recordings of STN LFP signals have been shown to be stable over months using an implanted amplifier (<a href=\"#bib35\">Quinn et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Neumann et al., 2016</a>), and the signals are similar at re-operation several years later (<a href=\"#bib24\">Giannicola et al., 2012</a>). It is also possible that the predictive potential of the STN LFP might be further improved in patients without Parkinson\u2019s disease, as dopamine increases the reactivity of beta and gamma activities around the time of movement (<a href=\"#bib16\">Doyle et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Androulidakis et al., 2007</a>). Moreover the reliability of predictions was dependent on the relative scale of movement-related power changes in the gamma band which could be improved by refinements in electrode design and targeting, perhaps using this reactivity to select the optimum implantation target. Therefore, LFP signals recorded from the basal ganglia have the potential to provide stable and high-performance BMI input signals for the control of neuroprosthetic devices in paralysed patients, complementary or alternative to spikes or ECoG signals recorded from the cortex. In this regard, it is important to note that some LFP reactivity is retained when movements are imagined rather than actioned (<a href=\"#bib27\">K\u00fchn et al., 2006</a>), suggesting that peripheral afferents may not be necessary for the beta suppression and gamma increases tracked here."

Any application is predicated on the assumption that the spectral reactivity demonstrated in the STN of treated PD patients is more-or-less preserved in chronically paralysed patients. This remains to be proven. Although our results suggest that basal ganglia LFP changes might potentially be useful in force control, the selection of movements or effectors is also important in BMI control. Whether and to which extent movements involving different body parts, such the lower as opposed to the upper limb, can be decoded from the STN LFP remains unaddressed, although microelectrode recordings suggest some spatial segregation in activity related to different limbs in the human STN (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rodriguez-Oroz et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Theodosopoulos et al., 2003</a>). In addition, we have not demonstrated the specificity of STN LFPs for the decoding of force. Finally, plasticity of cortical control signals is likely to play a significant role in the maximisation of the performance of BMIs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carmena et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ganguly and Carmena, 2009</a>), and yet whether subcortical signals can adapt over time remains to be seen."

First and foremost, we were unable to predict the\u00a0force in about half of our patients. There may be many reasons for this, including disease related impairments despite dopaminergic therapy, post-operative stun effects and failure to pick up LFP activity from the \u2018motor\u2019 STN due to electrode targeting error. Confirmation that some electrode contacts were in or touching the STN was given by the surgical team at each centre upon review of pre- and post-operative imaging blinded to the electrophysiological results. According to this standard seven out of the nine electrodes affording force prediction were on target, with the other two electrodes in the posterolateral tail of STN. This suggests that significant movement-related spectral modulation in the beta and gamma bands, -the basis for selecting out this group in the first place, might be a good electrophysiological marker of proximity to the STN, and perhaps to the region of the STN involved in the motor representation of the hand in particular. Noteworthy in this regard, the spatial gradient of gamma reactivity was more acute than that of beta reactivity. In contrast, six out of the 12 electrodes that did not allow reasonable force prediction were identified as neither being in nor touching the STN and these subsequently revised on four sides or left inactive on two sides. A stun effect or disease related impairment might help account for the lack of joint beta and gamma reactivity in the remaining patients in this group, although two of these still had significant modulation in the beta band and one in the gamma band."

Amongst these, predicted force based on the STN LFP features was also noisier than the measured force. This could be caused by dynamic fluctuations and short-time-scale events in the STN LFP oscillatory activity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Feingold et al., 2015</a>). It could be improved by incorporating a time history of the LFP signals which is equivalent to filtering the control input from the brain, and by incorporating filtering algorithms in the predicted force (the plant output of the model) in the time domain, such as the Kalman filter, or by convolving the output with a static nonlinearity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fagg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Flint et al., 2014</a>). Alternatively the relatively noisy predictions might in part reflect involuntary dyskinetic movement that did not impinge on grip force and yet may have been parameterised in the LFP control signal. Second, in a minority of trials grip forces were predicted based on the STN LFP but there was no measured force. This might represent a\u00a0movement intention with consequent LFP change without movement execution, or voluntary movements that were not captured by the force dynamometer. Likewise these factors might have modified baseline LFPs in some trials leading to the negative force predicted in rare trials, unless predictions were clamped so as not to fall below zero. Third, the force prediction presented here focuses on the rest, force initialization, development and stable force holding phase of a grip, but does not include the force release or termination phase."

Patients underwent bilateral implantation of DBS electrodes into the STN, as a prelude to therapeutic high frequency stimulation for advanced idiopathic PD with motor fluctuations and/or dyskinesia. Techniques to target and implant electrodes in the STN have previously been described (<a href=\"#bib22\">Foltynie and Hariz, 2010</a>). Microelectrode recordings were not made during surgery. The permanent quadripolar macroelectrode used was model 3389 (Medtronic Neurologic Division, Minneapolis, MN, USA) featuring four platinum-iridium cylindrical surfaces. Its contacts are numbered 0, 1, 2, and 3, with 0 being the most caudal and contact three being the most cranial. Localisation was supported intra-operatively by the effects of direct stimulation and by immediate post-operative stereotactic imaging. Nonetheless, in acknowledgement of the fact that not all electrode contacts could be expected to lie in the STN per se, we term the area sampled by the electrode contact the STN region (STNr). DBS electrode extension cables were externalized through the scalp to enable recordings prior to connection to a subcutaneous DBS pacemaker, implanted in a second operative procedure up to seven days later.

Grip force was measured one hand at a time using an isometric dynamometer with standard Jamar design, and its handle set in the second of the five discrete grip diameter adjustments possible (G200; Biometrics Ltd, Gwent, UK). The order in which left and right hands were tested was counterbalanced across subjects. Monopolar LFPs recorded with a TMSi porti (TMS international, Netherlands) and its respective software. A common average reference was used for the monopolar recordings and these were low and high pass filtered at 0.5 and 500 Hz, respectively. Bipolar signals were derived offline by subtracting the monopolar recordings between neighbouring contacts on each electrode. The\u00a0force was only a\u00a0low pass filtered at 200 Hz. EMG signals from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) of the activated hand were recorded in all patients, and the EMG signals from the extensor digitorum communis or extensor carpi ulnaris of both lower arms were recorded in six out of the 11 patients. LFP, EMG and force measurements were initially sampled at 2048 Hz. The effort level the subject reported verbally after each grip was logged manually and then used to label each individual trial."

Nonetheless, in acknowledgement of the fact that not all electrode contacts could be expected to lie in the STN per se, we term the area sampled by the electrode contact the STN region (STNr). Continuous wavelet transform, with Morlet wavelet and cycle number of 7, was then applied to LFP recordings from each bipolar contact pairs for time-frequency decomposition. The average power changes relative to the pre-movement baseline over the three trials of maximal effort gripping was calculated for each bipolar contact in the contralateral STNr. Three features from each bipolar LFP signal were extracted: the power change in the theta/alpha (4\u201312 Hz) band, beta (13\u201330 Hz) and gamma (55\u201390 Hz) frequency bands. For each electrode, the bipolar signal with the largest movement related reduction in the beta power was selected for analysis. Further, the average power in each frequency band and at each time point was compared against the distribution of the average power for that frequency over a one second period of time before the cue. Significant movement-related modulations were defined as those trials in which there were at least 50% of time points during the second after movement onset with power smaller than the 5% boundary (to capture event related desynchronization) or larger than the 95% boundary (to capture event related synchronisation) of the power distribution before movement for that frequency band. This procedure identified 9 STNs (from six different patients) with significant movement-related modulations in both the beta band and the gamma band; three more STNs showed significant movement-related modulations in either the beta or gamma band. However, there was no significant movement-related modulation in either beta or gamma band in the remaining 9 STNs. Details of the patient and the average power changes during the second after cue onset for maximal effort gripping in the beta and gamma bands for each STN are presented in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>."

For each individual trial of gripping, the power change for each frequency at each time point was calculated by normalizing the power at that time point against the average power during the 1 s before cue presentation, so 0 indicates the power being the same as the baseline activity before cue, positive values indicate power increase (referred to as ERS) and negative value indicate power decrease (referred to as ERD).

The latter frequency range of 55\u201390 Hz was selected on the basis of our previous study showing that STN LFP activities within this range increase during the onset of a grip (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anzak et al., 2012</a>) and correlate with the stable force achieved during a grip (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tan et al., 2013</a>)."

For each STN/contralateral hand, the parameters of different models were first identified using least-squares optimisation applied on a set of training data to fit the corresponding STNr LFP features and measured force of the training data. The decoding accuracy of the models was evaluated by applying the model with identified parameters on another set of testing data. When evaluating the performance of the model applied to across-trial averages, the average of STNr LFP features and forces over multiple trials of low effort levels was first used as the training data to identify the model parameters, and the model was then tested on average data from high effort trials; or vice versa, i.e. using the across-trial average of high effort trials as training data and the averages from low effort trials as testing data. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used for model selection.

Five iterations would allow for each observation being used for validation exactly once. The five results were then combined to produce a single complete estimation for one session.

Ten patients were recorded in the study when the patients were asked to grip as fast and as hard as they can in each trial in response to an external cue. The details of patient information and experimental paradigms were reported in a previous publication (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anzak et al., 2012</a>). Twenty trials were collected for each hand when the patients were on their normal dopaminergic medication. Within each STN in this independent patient group, a 4-fold cross validation was used. For each iteration, 15 trials were used to fit the model to estimate model parameters and the model was used to predict force on the remaining five trials. The same procedure was repeated four times so each trial was used for prediction exactly once. The correlation coefficients between the predicted force and measured force for each individual trial were quantified."

To do so they dynamically decoded gripping force based on LFP recorded from the STN in Parkinson's disease patients with implanted DBS electrodes. In nine STN (out of 21 tested) of 5 patients (out of 11 tested) they found significant movement related modulations in the beta and the gamma frequency domain. Further analysis of the activity of these 9 STN revealed that gamma (55-95 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands of the STN LFP were most informative about gripping force, and that a first order dynamic linear model can be used to decode the temporal profile of gripping force."

We have now included the average force trajectories of different effort levels for the two patient groups in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and E</a>). We have also calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient between the average force during the holding phase (1.0-2.0s after cue) and the self-rated effort (SRE) for each hand in both groups. This has identified significantly lower correlation coefficients between stable force and self-rated effort in the 2nd group (also shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), indicating impairment in the scaling of force with effort in the 2nd group.

The following has been included in the manuscript: \u201cFinally, the first order dynamic model with beta and gamma power changes as inputs (Model 2) was used to predict gripping force from individual trials in an independent patient group that performed a different, but related, paradigm. Ten patients were recorded in this study and were asked to grip as fast and as strongly as they could in each trial in response to an external cue. Twenty trials were collected for each hand when the patients were on their normal dopaminergic medication. Details of patient information and experimental paradigm were previously reported (Anzak et al., 2012). The average movement related power change in the STN LFP activities and results of force prediction in this patient group are shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. The median correlation coefficient between predicted force and measured force for individual trials (median WithinR) ranged between 0.3848 and 0.9421 for the 20 STNs and contralateral hand (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).
