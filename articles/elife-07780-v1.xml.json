Neurofibromin exhibits Ras GTPase activating protein (Ras-GAP) activity that is thought to mediate cellular functions relevant to disease phenotypes. Loss of murine <i>Nf1</i> results in embryonic lethality due to heart defects, while mice with monoallelic loss of function mutations, or with tissue-specific inactivation have been used to model NF1. Here, we characterize previously unappreciated phenotypes in <i>Nf1<sup>-/-</sup></i> embryos, which are inhibition of hemogenic endothelial specification in the dorsal aorta, enhanced yolk sac hematopoiesis, and exuberant cardiac blood island formation. We show that a missense mutation engineered into the active site of the Ras-GAP domain is sufficient to reproduce ectopic blood island formation, cardiac defects and overgrowth of neural crest-derived structures seen in <i>Nf1<sup>-/-</sup></i> embryos. These findings demonstrate a role for Ras-GAP activity in suppressing hemogenic potential of the heart, and restricting growth of neural crest-derived tissues."
