                    "text": "In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, abundant 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24 nt siRNA) guide the cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes. 24 nt siRNA biogenesis requires nuclear RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2) and DICER-like 3 (DCL3). However, siRNA precursors are mostly undefined. We identified Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs (P4R2 RNAs) that accumulate in <i>dcl3</i> mutants and are diced into 24 nt RNAs by DCL3 in vitro. P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nt and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. RDR2 terminal transferase activity, also demonstrated in vitro, may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P4R2 RNA 3\u2019 termini. The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5\u2019 or 3\u2019 ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model whereby siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events."

However, siRNA precursors are mostly undefined. We identified Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs (P4R2 RNAs) that accumulate in <i>dcl3</i> mutants and are diced into 24 nt RNAs by DCL3 in vitro. P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nt and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. RDR2 terminal transferase activity, also demonstrated in vitro, may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P4R2 RNA 3\u2019 termini. The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5\u2019 or 3\u2019 ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model whereby siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events."

Pol V is not required for siRNA biogenesis at most loci (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mosher et al., 2008</a>) but generates non-coding RNAs to which siRNA-AGO4 complexes bind (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wierzbicki et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">2009</a>).

Because Pol IV localization is unaffected in <i>rdr2</i> null mutants, but RDR2 is mis-localized in Pol IV null mutants (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pontes et al., 2006</a>), Pol IV has been thought to act first in the pathway, generating single-stranded RNAs that then serve as templates for second strand synthesis by RDR2 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pikaard, 2006</a>).

Recently, Pol IV and RDR2-dependent transcripts that accumulate in vivo in <i>dcl2 dcl3 dcl4</i> (<i>dcl2/3/4</i>) mutants were identified (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2015</a>). In that study, RNAs were fragmented prior to sequencing and short\u00a0sequence reads that overlapped\u00a0were then assembled, computationally, into longer contiguous sequences. These analyses led to the conclusion that Pol IV and RDR2 generate transcripts that can be many hundreds of nucleotides in length, and thus large enough to encode multiple siRNAs, as in current models. Here, we present RNA blot hybridization, deep sequencing, in vitro transcription and in vitro DCL3 dicing results that yield a different interpretation, showing that Pol IV and RDR2 primarily generate dsRNAs shorter than 45 nucleotides. Based on sequence alignments and sequence motifs shared by Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNAs (P4R2 RNAs) and siRNAs, we propose that siRNAs are typically generated by a single internal DCL3 cleavage event whose position is measured from either end of a short P4R2 RNA."

The longer RNAs that accumulate in <i>dcl2/3/4</i> triple mutants fail to accumulate in the absence of Pol IV (<i>nrpd1</i> subunit mutant) or RDR2 (lanes 9,10). This indicates that Pol IV and RDR2 are each required for the biogenesis of the longer RNAs, paralleling their requirement for 24 and 23 nt siRNA biogenesis (lanes 13,14). The longer RNAs (&gt;25 nt) are also reduced in abundance if Pol V or AGO4 are mutated in the <i>dcl2/3/4</i> triple mutant background (lanes 11,12), analogous to the degree to which siRNA levels are reduced, but not eliminated, in <i>ago4</i> or <i>pol V</i> single mutants (lanes 15,16). These observations are consistent with Pol V and AGO4 being important, but not essential, for biogenesis of the majority of 23/24 nt siRNAs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mosher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pontier et al., 2005</a>), most likely due to their roles in establishing or maintaining DNA and histone methylation marks that recruit Pol IV to its sites of action (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blevins et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Law et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>)."

In wild-type plants (ecotype Col-0), 24 and 23 nt siRNAs represent the most abundant small RNA class, as expected, outnumbering unique 21 nt small RNA species, which include miRNAs as well as siRNAs, by approximately 10-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In <i>dcl2/3/4</i> triple mutants, the small RNA profile is substantially altered. Because DCL1-dependent 21 nt RNAs are unaffected, they become the most abundant small RNA class in <i>dcl2/3/4</i> mutants. The dramatic loss of 23 and 24 nt siRNAs in <i>dcl2/3/4</i> triple mutants coincides with the occurrence of longer RNAs, mostly smaller than 45 nucleotides and displaying a peak at \u223c30 nt (see also <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These genome-wide RNA-seq results correlate closely with the RNA blot hybridization results observed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> at 5S rRNA gene loci. Indeed, a browser display of RNA-seq results focused on the region that corresponds to the 5S probes used for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> (siR1003) shows that\u00a0RNAs that accumulate in <i>dcl2/3/4</i> mutants range in size from 26\u201342 nt, with a mean size of 30 nt (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

Interestingly, P4R2 RNAs that begin with A account for the weak 3\u2019 ACU consensus that is detected in analyses of total P4R2 RNAs. By contrast, P4R2 RNAs that begin with G lack the ACU signature, but instead show a preference for U &gt;\u00a0C &gt;\u00a0A at the 3\u2019 terminal position. Interestingly, U &gt;\u00a0C &gt;\u00a0A is the same nucleotide preference order observed at the 3\u2019 termini of 24 nt siRNAs. Collectively, these observations suggest that P4R2 RNAs that begin with A might tend to give rise to 24 nt siRNAs from their 5\u2019 ends, whereas P4R2 RNAs that begin with G might tend to give rise to 24 nt siRNAs from their 3\u2019 ends. It is noteworthy that P4R2 RNAs that begin with G show a strong tendency to end with U, such that the complementary strand (which can be considered the bottom strand) is expected to begin with A. Thus, it may be that DCL3 cutting of precursor duplexes preferentially takes place at a fixed distance from a 5\u2019 terminal adenosine present on either strand of the duplex. This hypothesis is consistent with in vitro data of Nagano et al. demonstrating that DCL3 preferentially cleaves dsRNAs with A or U at the 5\u2019 end (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nagano et al., 2014</a>)."

Our analyses indicate that 24 nt siRNAs are preferentially generated from the 5\u2019 or 3\u2019 ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting that P4R2 duplex RNAs can be diced from either end, also in agreement with Nagano et al.\u2019s studies. Generation of siRNAs from the ends of P4R2 RNAs, rather than from internal sequences, leads to the prediction that each P4R2 RNA sequence has limited capacity to specify multiple alternative siRNAs. Thus, the multitude of unique 24 nt siRNA sequences present in wild-type cells can be expected to be derived from a similarly large number of P4R2 precursors, depending on whether one or both strands of diced duplexes are utilized as siRNAs. Consistent with this prediction, our sequenced datasets included 1,055,471 unique 23 or 24 nt siRNA sequences (in wild-type plants) and 933,453 unique P4R2 RNAs of 26\u201394 nt (in <i>dcl2/3/4</i> triple mutants)."

Alternatively, if RDR2 were to act upstream of Pol IV, which is contrary to current models, but a formal possibility, one might similarly expect to detect RDR2 transcripts in a <i>pol IV</i> mutant. However, our RNA blot results (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) defy these predictions, as do the RNA-seq data for <i>pol IV</i> and <i>rdr2</i> mutants. Instead, precursors are depleted if either RDR2 or Pol IV is absent. This suggests that Pol IV and RDR2 are each required for the synthesis of both strands of P4R2 RNA duplexes, as was also noted by Li et al.

Sequences enriched at the ends of P4R2 RNAs preclude easy assignment of which polymerase generated them. For instance, P4R2 RNAs tend to begin with a purine and end with a pyrimidine such that the complementary strands should also be enriched for purines at the 5\u2019 end and pyrimidines at the 3\u2019 end. The terminal transferase activity inherent to RDR2 provides a plausible explanation for mismatched, untemplated nucleotides at the 3\u2019 ends of some (\u223c5%) P4R2 RNAs, but this activity could modify completed RNA transcripts made by Pol IV, RDR2, or both. Despite these uncertainties, P4R2 RNAs preferentially begin with a purine that, in the context of the genome sequence, tends to occur immediately downstream of a pyrimidine (in the equivalent DNA strand). This pyrimidine\u2013purine rule is a characteristic of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, in general, and has a structural basis that involves base-stacking interactions between the initiating (+1) RNA nucleotide (a purine) and \u22121 DNA template nucleotide (also a purine), in addition to the base-pairing that occurs between the +1\u00a0RNA and +1 DNA template\u00a0bases (<a href=\"#bib1\">Basu et al., 2014</a>). The pyrimidine\u2013purine rule has been shown to apply to protein-coding genes throughout the Arabidopsis genome (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cumbie et al., 2015</a>), to Arabidopsis pre-rRNAs transcribed by multisubunit RNA Pol I (these initiate with an A downstream of a T; <a href=\"#bib10\">Doelling et al., 1993</a>) and to 5S genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III (initiating with a G downstream of a T). Our in vitro transcription studies using affinity-purified Pol IV or Pol II also recapitulate the pyrimidine\u2013purine rule. Moreover, Pol IV generates relatively short RNAs in vitro, with size distributions and 3\u2019 ends resembling those of P4R2 RNAs. Collectively, these observations suggest that P4R2 RNA biogenesis is initiated by Pol IV, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, with limited processivity of Pol IV accounting for the relatively short size of P4R2 RNAs. In our model, designed to account for the consensus sequences of P4R2 RNAs and 24 nt siRNAs (refer to <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), Pol IV generates first strands that initiate with a purine. Those RNAs that initiate with A best account for siRNA 5\u2019 end sequences, whereas RNAs that initiate with G best account for siRNA 3\u2019 end sequences, suggesting that resulting duplexes, following second strand synthesis by RDR2, are diced from opposite ends. Because first strand RNAs that begin with G tend to end with U, their complementary strands would tend to begin with A. Thus dicing measured from a 5\u2019 adenosine might be a preference underlying the alternative dicing of P4R2 duplexes from either end."

A similar signature is detected at the 5\u2019 end of 24 nt siRNAs (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), except that only A (not G) is enriched at the 5\u2019 terminus of these siRNAs. Thus, DICER-like 3\u00a0(DCL3) cleavage measured from the 5\u2019 adenosine of those P4R2 RNAs that begin with A could account for the similar 5\u2019 end sequences of P4R2 RNAs and 24 nt siRNAs. P4R2 RNAs that begin with A tend to end with ACU, which is not reflected in siRNAs. However, P4R2 RNAs that begin with G tend to end with a 3\u2019 U, with U &gt;\u00a0C &gt;\u00a0A being the order of preference, which matches the 3\u2019 end consensus for 24 nt siRNAs. Because P4R2 RNAs that begin with G most often end with U, their complementary strands (purple bottom strands in the figure) would tend to have A at their 5\u2019 ends. DCL3 dicing, measured from this 5\u2019 A, would liberate a top strand (red in the figure) whose 3\u2019 end could account for the 3\u2019 consensus (U &gt;\u00a0C &gt;\u00a0A) of 24 nt siRNAs."

Reactions were subjected to centrifugation through Performa spin columns (EdgeBiosystems, Gaitherburg, MD), the filtrate was adjusted to 0.3M sodium acetate, and nucleic acids were precipitated with isopropanol. The pellets were resuspended in 8 \u03bcl water and DNase-treated using Turbo DNA-<i>free</i> kit reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). The samples were then treated with Terminator exonuclease (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) to remove potentially degraded RNAs with 5\u2019 monophosphates, cleaned with RNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA), and then treated with RNA 5\u2019 Polyphosphatase (Epicentre Biotechnologies) to convert 5\u2019 triphosphate groups to monophosphates. All enzyme treatments were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Adapter ligation and library construction was performed using a TruSeq small RNA kit (Illumina). Paired-end sequencing was conducted using an Illumina MiSeq instrument. Paired reads were mapped to the M13 sequence using default settings of BWA (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li and Durbin, 2009</a>) for Illumina. Insert sizes were calculated using the CollectInsertSizeMetrics Picard tool. BWA and Picard tools were accessed via The Galaxy Project public server (UseGalaxy.org)."

To address this comment we have added four new figures or supplemental figures to the revised manuscript, namely <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary files 1 and 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. In the initial version of the manuscript, we focused solely on the comparison of RNA-seq datasets from wild-type (ecotype Col-0) plants and <i>dcl2 dcl3 dcl4</i> (abbreviated as <i>dcl2/3/4</i>) mutants, in which P4R2 RNAs accumulate to their highest levels. However, in parallel with these Col-0 and <i>dcl2/3/4</i> datasets, we had also performed RNA-seq analyses for <i>nrpd1</i> and <i>rdr2</i> mutants (with 2 biological replicates for each genotype). In the revised manuscript, we now make use of all of these datasets to show that the P4R2 RNAs that accumulate in <i>dcl2/3/4</i> mutants are also detected (albeit at lower levels) in wild-type Col-0 but are absent or depleted in <i>nrpd1</i> or <i>rdr2</i> mutants. A genome browser view making this point graphically for three representative loci is shown in new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a> shows browser views for three additional loci. <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> is a table showing more than 5500 genomic intervals (with a window size of 100 bp) in which 24 nt siRNAs are detected, and in which putative P4R2 RNAs (&gt;25 nt, &lt;95 nt) are also detected, in both <i>dcl2/3/4</i> and wild-type, but are depleted in <i>nrpd1</i> or <i>rdr2</i> mutants. In this table, data are provided for both independent biological replicates for each genotype, with high confidence P4R2 RNA \u2013 generating intervals being those in which the RNAs are depleted in both <i>nrpd1</i> and r<i>dr2</i> replicates. In <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>, we also show that 20 of the 22 Pol IV-dependent transcript loci confirmed by Li et al. (2015) to be capable of generating Pol IV transcripts are included among our P4R2 loci. These authors also provided genetic evidence for Pol IV and RDR2-dependence of the transcripts. Collectively, we think that these data show convincingly that P4R2 RNAs are, indeed, dependent on both Pol IV and RDR2, thus justifying the P4R2 nomenclature."

These transcripts are similar in size distribution to those of P4R2 RNAs observed in vivo. Moreover, the start site consensus we observed for P4R2 RNAs is also observed for these in vitro transcripts. In addition, the 3\u2019 ends of the Pol IV transcripts also resemble the 3\u2019 end sequences of P4R2 RNAs. These new data support the hypothesis that P4R2 RNAs are Pol IV transcripts."

We have re-written this section to make it clearer. The two controls (no added protein, or potentially FLAG-purified proteins from non-transgenic plants that don't express FLAG-tagged DCL3) were conducted side-by-side with the affinity-purified DCL3 sample, and they show that undigested precursor RNAs remain even after the incubation period allowed for DCL3 digestion. Thus the precursor RNAs must also have been present at time zero."
