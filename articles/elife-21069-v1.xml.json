The Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes are the main microtubule binding components of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> kinetochore. Cooperation between these two complexes enhances kinetochore-microtubule coupling and is regulated by Aurora B kinase. We show that the Ndc80 complex can simultaneously bind and bridge across two Dam1 complex rings through a tripartite interaction, each component of which is regulated by Aurora B kinase. Mutations in any one of the Ndc80p interaction regions abrogates the Ndc80 complex's ability to bind two Dam1 rings <i>in vitro</i>, and results in kinetochore biorientation and microtubule attachment defects <i>in vivo</i>. We also show that an extra-long Ndc80 complex, engineered to space the two Dam1 rings further apart, does not support growth. Taken together, our work suggests that each kinetochore <i>in vivo</i> contains two Dam1 rings and that proper spacing between the rings is vital."
