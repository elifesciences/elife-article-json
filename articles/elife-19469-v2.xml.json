Unusual 3\u21923 cross-links formed by L,D-transpeptidases were first detected in <i>Escherichia coli</i> more than four decades ago, however no phenotype has previously been associated with their synthesis. Here we show that production of the L,D-transpeptidase YcbB in combination with elevated synthesis of the (p)ppGpp alarmone by RelA lead to full bypass of the D,D-transpeptidase activity of PBPs and to broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam resistance. Production of YcbB was therefore sufficient to switch the role of (p)ppGpp from antibiotic tolerance to high-level \u03b2-lactam resistance. This observation identifies a new mode of peptidoglycan polymerization in <i>E. coli</i> that relies on an unexpectedly small number of enzyme activities comprising the glycosyltransferase activity of class A PBP1b and the D,D-carboxypeptidase activity of DacA in addition to the L,D-transpeptidase activity of YcbB."

Unusual 3\u21923 cross-links formed by L,D-transpeptidases were first detected in <i>Escherichia coli</i> more than four decades ago, however no phenotype has previously been associated with their synthesis. Here we show that production of the L,D-transpeptidase YcbB in combination with elevated synthesis of the (p)ppGpp alarmone by RelA lead to full bypass of the D,D-transpeptidase activity of PBPs and to broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam resistance. Production of YcbB was therefore sufficient to switch the role of (p)ppGpp from antibiotic tolerance to high-level \u03b2-lactam resistance. This observation identifies a new mode of peptidoglycan polymerization in <i>E. coli</i> that relies on an unexpectedly small number of enzyme activities comprising the glycosyltransferase activity of class A PBP1b and the D,D-carboxypeptidase activity of DacA in addition to the L,D-transpeptidase activity of YcbB."

                        "text": "Peptidoglycan, the major component of bacterial cell walls, is a giant (10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> Da) net-like macromolecule composed of glycan strands cross-linked by short peptides (<a href=\"#bib32\">Turner et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The glycan strands are polymerized by glycosyltransferases and the cross-links are formed by D,D-transpeptidases. The latter enzymes cleave the D-Ala<sup>4</sup>-D-Ala<sup>5</sup> peptide bond of an acyl donor stem and link the carbonyl of D-Ala<sup>4</sup> to the side chain amine of diaminopimelic acid (DAP) of the acceptor stem, thereby generating D-Ala<sup>4</sup>\u2192DAP<sup>3</sup> cross-links (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Pratt, 2008</a>). \u03b2-lactam antibiotics mimic the D-Ala<sup>4</sup>-D-Ala<sup>5</sup> termination of peptidoglycan precursors and inactivate the D,D-transpeptidases by acting as suicide substrates (<a href=\"#bib29\">Tipper and Strominger, 1965</a>). The D,D-transpeptidases belong to a diverse family of proteins, commonly referred to as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), that fall into three main classes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Sauvage et al., 2008</a>). Class A PBPs (PBP1a, 1b, and 1c) combine glycosyltransferase and D,D-transpeptidase modules. Class B PBPs (PBP2 and 3) are composed of a nonenzymatic morphogenesis module fused to a D,D-transpeptidase module. Class C PBPs (PBP4, 4b, 5, 6, 6b, 7, and AmpH) are monofunctional enzymes with D,D-carboxypeptidase and endopeptidase activities that hydrolyze the D-Ala<sup>4</sup>-D-Ala<sup>5</sup> bond of pentapeptide stems and the D-Ala<sup>4</sup>\u2192DAP<sup>3</sup> bond of cross-linked peptidoglycan, respectively. Peptidoglycan polymerization involves two complexes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), the divisome and the elongasome, responsible for septum formation and lateral cell-wall elongation, respectively (<a href=\"#bib8\">den Blaauwen et al., 2008</a>). These complexes include all the biosynthetic and hydrolytic enzymes required for the incorporation of new subunits into the expanding peptidoglycan net, as well as cytoskeletal proteins, MreB and FtsZ, acting as guiding devices."

More recently, we have identified the L,D-transpeptidases (Ldt) responsible for the formation of 3\u21923 cross-links in various bacterial species and shown that these enzymes are structurally unrelated to PBPs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mainardi et al., 2008</a>).

In contrast, L,D-transpeptidases are slowly acylated by these drugs and the resulting acyl-enzymes are unstable (<a href=\"#bib31\">Triboulet et al., 2013</a>). This accounts for L,D-transpeptidase-mediated penam and cephem resistance since slow acylation combined with acyl-enzyme hydrolysis results in partial L,D-transpeptidase inhibition. In this study, resistance to ampicillin and ceftriaxone was used to assess the capacity of L,D-transpeptidases to bypass PBPs in <i>E. coli</i>. In order to control the level of production of the L,D-transpeptidase YcbB, the corresponding gene was cloned under the control of the IPTG-inducible <i>trc</i> promoter of the vector pTRCKm. The resulting plasmid, pJEH11(<i>ycbB</i>), was introduced into strain BW25113\u03944 (8), which does not harbor any of the remaining L,D-transpeptidase genes, <i>i.e. ynhG</i>, <i>ybiS</i>, <i>erfK</i>, and <i>ycfS</i>. Plasmid pJEH11(<i>ycbB</i>) did not confer ampicillin resistance to this host in the absence of IPTG or in media containing low concentrations of this inducer (up to 50 \u00b5M). Induction of <i>ycbB</i> expression with IPTG concentrations greater than 50 \u00b5M prevented bacterial growth, indicating that high-level production of the L,D-transpeptidase YcbB was toxic. Selection for ampicillin resistance (32 \u00b5g/ml) in the presence of IPTG (500 \u00b5M) yielded mutant M1, which was not inhibited by 500 \u00b5M IPTG and displayed IPTG-inducible resistance to ampicillin and ceftriaxone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Genetic analyses showed that mutant M1 harbors two mutations."

                                "text": "Purified YcbB used as the acyl donor a disaccharide-tetrapeptide ending in D-Ala<sup>4</sup>, but not a disaccharide-pentapeptide ending in D-Ala<sup>4</sup>-D-Ala<sup>5</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We therefore investigated low-molecular-weight class C PBPs to identify the D,D-carboxypeptidase that generates the substrate of YcbB by cleavage of the D-Ala<sup>4</sup>-D-Ala<sup>5</sup> peptide bond of pentapeptide stems. We reasoned that selection for YcbB-mediated ampicillin resistance could be used to determine whether a host strain produces the D,D-carboxypeptidase partner of YcbB for peptidoglycan polymerization. Note that partner refers in the context of this study to an enzyme that is essential for peptidoglycan polymerization in conditions where YcbB is the sole functional transpeptidase without implying that a physical contact between YcbB and that protein exists or is essential for enzyme activity. We therefore introduced plasmid pJEH12(<i>ycbB</i>) into the mutant from the Keio collection that harbors a kanamycin-resistance cassette in place of <i>dacA</i> encoding class C PBP5 (12). Plating the resulting strain on agar containing ceftriaxone (32 \u00b5g/ml) and IPTG (50 \u00b5M) led to no survivors (frequency &lt;10<sup>\u20139</sup>), unless a plasmid copy of <i>dacA</i> was provided <i>in trans</i> (9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20136</sup>) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Thus, the D,D-carboxypeptidase PBP5 was essential for YcbB-mediated \u03b2-lactam resistance. In contrast, independent deletions of <i>dacB, dacC,</i> and <i>dacD</i> encoding PBP4, PBP6, and PBP6b, respectively, had no impact on the frequency of selection of ceftriaxone-resistant mutants (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Further analyses were performed with strain CS801-4 (13), which was obtained by deletions of <i>dacA, dacB, dacC, dacD, mrcA</i>, <i>ampH</i>, and <i>ampC</i> (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). In this host, plasmids pJEH12(<i>ycbB</i>) and p<i>Trc</i>99A\u2126<i>dacA</i> were both required for selection of ceftriaxone-resistant mutants. These results indicate that the D,D-carboxypeptidase activity of PBP5 is necessary and sufficient to generate the essential tetrapeptide-containing substrate of YcbB. It is of note that PBP5 is only inhibited by high concentrations of \u03b2-lactams (<a href=\"#bib5\">Curtis et al., 1979</a>). This accounts for the proposed participation of PBP5 in peptidoglycan synthesis in the presence of \u03b2-lactams. This also accounts for the residual activity of cefoxitin (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, inhibition zone of 30\u2009mm) since this cephalosporin displays moderate activity against PBP5 (14)."

Ceftriaxone-resistant mutants were obtained with the <i>mrcA</i>, <i>pbpC</i>, and <i>mgtA</i> mutants, but not with the <i>mrcB</i> mutant, indicating that PBP1b is an essential partner of YcbB for peptidoglycan polymerization in the presence of \u03b2-lactams."

To assess the role of the transpeptidase activity of PBP1b, the <i>mrcB</i> gene was introduced into plasmid p<i>Trc</i>99A, and the transpeptidase module was inactivated by the substitution S<sup>510</sup>A (<a href=\"#bib28\">Terrak et al., 1999</a>). It has been previously shown that PBP1b harboring this substitution is able to catalyze in vitro the polymerization of lipid II into glycan strands in the absence of TPase activity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Terrak et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Egan et al., 2015</a>).

Selection of ceftriaxone-resistant mutants was obtained in both cases. Thus, the glycosyltransferase activity of PBP1b, but not its D,D-transpeptidase activity, is required for YcbB-mediated \u03b2-lactam resistance. We also tested PBP1b harboring the E<sup>233</sup>M substitution inactivating the glycosyltransferase domain of the protein using the same approach. As expected, ceftriaxone-resistant mutants were not obtained with derivative of BW25113\u0394<i>mrcB</i> producing YcbB and PBP1b E<sup>233</sup>M. The limitation of the latter observation is that no or significantly reduced transpeptidase activity is observed when the glycosyltransferase of <i>E. coli</i> class A PBPs is not functional, although the latter enzymes still bind \u03b2-lactam antibiotics indicating a properly folded transpeptidase domain (<a href=\"#bib28\">Terrak et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Egan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Born et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bertsche et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">den Blaauwen et al., 1990</a>).

In the presence of IPTG, mutant M1 was resistant to mecillinam and aztreonam, indicating that inhibition of the D,D-transpeptidase module of the class B PBPs did not impair YcbB-mediated ampicillin resistance (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and data not shown). Surprisingly, M1 was resistant to mecillinam in the absence of IPTG. M1<sub>cured</sub> was also resistant to mecillinam, indicating that resistance to this antibiotic was mediated by a chromosomal mutation independently from YcbB production (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This observation raised the possibility that the same mutation might be responsible both for mecillinam resistance in the absence of YcbB in M1<sub>cured</sub> and for broad-spectrum resistance to penams and cephems in M1 following the\u00a0induction of the plasmid copy of <i>ycbB</i> by IPTG. To test this hypothesis, derivatives of strain BW25113/pJEH12(<i>ycbB</i>) were selected on media containing mecillinam alone (50 \u00b5g/ml) or ampicillin (32 \u00b5g/ml) and IPTG (50 \u00b5M). Independent mutants obtained on each selective medium were analyzed for expression of \u03b2-lactam resistance. Four of the seven mutants selected on mecillinam remained susceptible to ampicillin both in the presence or absence of IPTG. The three remaining mecillinam-resistant mutants (M2, M3, and M4) displayed IPTG-inducible ampicillin resistance, as did mutant M1. All six mutants selected on ampicillin-and-IPTG-containing media (M5 to M10) were resistant to mecillinam in the absence of IPTG and, additionally, resistant to ampicillin in its presence (as was M1). These results indicate that acquisition of a mutation conferring mecillinam resistance is necessary and sufficient for YcbB-mediated ampicillin resistance. In contrast, only a portion of the mutations conferring mecillinam resistance enabled YcbB-mediated ampicillin resistance."

                        "text": "<i>E. coli</i> is known to resist \u03b2-lactams through a combination of drug inactivation by \u03b2-lactamases and reduced access of the drugs to their targets following activation of efflux pumps and modification of outer membrane porins. Here we show that <i>E. coli</i> can also resist \u03b2-lactams through bypass of the D,D-transpeptidase activity of high-molecular-weight PBPs. The resistance mechanism required production of the L,D-transpeptidase YcbB, which was purified and shown to catalyze the\u00a0formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in vitro (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and to be inactivated only by carbapenems (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), accounting for broad-spectrum resistance to other classes of \u03b2-lactams (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The bypass mechanism involves substantial modification of the set of enzymes required for peptidoglycan polymerization. In wild-type strains, lateral expansion of the peptidoglycan network and the\u00a0formation of the septum involve two protein complexes, the elongasome and the divisome, respectively, which integrate distinct sets of peptidoglycan polymerases with partially overlapping functions (<a href=\"#bib8\">den Blaauwen et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In contrast, the L,D-transpeptidase activity of YcbB is sufficient for peptidoglycan cross-linking in mutant M1. This conclusion is based on the exclusive detection of DAP<sup>3</sup>\u2192DAP<sup>3</sup> cross-links in the peptidoglycan of M1 grown in the presence of ampicillin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>) and on mutagenic or chemical invalidation of the transpeptidase module of class-A or -B PBPs (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table\u00a02</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In wild-type strains, glycan chains are polymerized by either PBP1a or PBP1b, although the former is preferentially associated with the elongasome and the latter with the divisome (<a href=\"#bib8\">den Blaauwen et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, PBP1b, together with its cognate lipoprotein LpoB, are both essential and sufficient for peptidoglycan polymerization in mutant M1 exposed to ampicillin. Peptidoglycan labeling with a fluorescent D-amino acid indicated that YcbB activity is preferentially located in the septum, as is its PBP1b partner (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). The cross-linking and glycosyltransferase activities of YcbB and PBP1b were nonetheless sufficient for lateral extension of the peptidoglycan network since bacterial cells retained a rod shape in the presence of ampicillin. This observation indicates that the cross-linking activity of high-molecular-weight PBPs is not indispensable to the maintenance of cell shape in <i>E. coli</i>. Together, our data identified a minimum set of enzyme activities that are necessary and sufficient for peptidoglycan polymerization in the presence of \u03b2-lactams (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). This set comprises the L,D-transpeptidase activity of YcbB, the glycosyltransferase activity of PBP1b, and the D,D-carboxypeptidase activity of PBP5, which provides the essential tetrapeptide substrate of YcbB. Bypass of the D,D-transpeptidase activity of PBPs by YcbB is potentially useful to explore the function of members of the polymerization complexes. For example, the fact that LpoB remains essential in the L,D-transpeptidation context indicates that it directly stimulates the glycosyltransferase activity of PBP1b, as indicated in a recent study (<a href=\"#bib21\">Markovski et al., 2016</a>)."

This conclusion was drawn from the construction of strains that conditionally produce YcbB and a truncated form of RelA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>) and by an\u00a0independent selection of mutants with impaired aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). Prior analyses also showed that PBP2 is not indispensable in <i>E. coli</i> when (p)ppGpp synthesis is increased, leading to mecillinam resistance (<a href=\"#bib34\">Vinella et al., 1992</a>). Aside from mecillinam resistance, increased (p)ppGpp synthesis has also been shown to regulate growth rate and several different stress responses, including the response to exposure to antibiotics (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hauryliuk et al., 2015</a>). The latter leads to persistence, a response that involves production of rare cells within a bacterial population that remain susceptible but are not killed by the drugs, in the absence of acquisition of any mutation. In <i>E. coli</i>, tolerance to ampicillin mediated by increased (p)ppGpp synthesis leads to a 1000-fold reduction in bacterial killing. The bacterial cells are tolerant to numerous antibiotics, including non-\u03b2-lactams, such as ciprofloxacin, which acts on DNA topoisomerases (<a href=\"#bib20\">Maisonneuve et al., 2013</a>). The cascade triggered by elevated (p)ppGpp involves an increase in the intracellular concentration of polyphosphate via inhibition of the exopolyphosphatase PPX. In turn, elevated polyphosphate stimulates the protease activity of Lon, which degrades antitoxins, thereby activating the toxins that prevent bacterial killing through inhibition of translation and bacterial growth. This cascade is distinct from YcbB-mediated ampicillin resistance in several respects. Persistence emerges from stochastic events that render a limited number of bacterial cells transiently tolerant to multiple families of antibiotics, whereas YcbB in combination with elevated (p)ppGpp rendered the bulk of the population resistant only to \u03b2-lactams that did not inactivate the L,D-transpeptidase activity of YcbB (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). In addition, plasmids pKT2(<i>ycbB</i>) and pKT8(<i>relA</i> 1\u2013455) conferred ampicillin and ceftriaxone resistance to mutants from the Keio collection deficient in production of the Lon protease and the polyphosphate kinase PPK (data not shown) indicating that tolerance and resistance do not involve the same (p)ppGpp-regulated circuits."

Fragments with an insert size of <i>ca.</i> 200 bp were gel-extracted and enriched with PCR (14 cycles) before library quantification and validation. Clusters were generated by hybridization of the library to the flow cell and bridge amplification. Single reads of 36 cycles were collected on a GAIIX (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The Illumina Analysis Pipeline (version 1.6) was used for image analysis, base calling, and error estimation. Raw sequence files were filtered using programs developed by N.

It describes the conditions necessary to generate a complete, ampicillin-resistant cell wall by employing a previously identified L,D-transpeptidase activity mediated by YcbB, in conjunction with increased alarmone levels. The importance of this work is that peptidoglycan biosynthesis represents a complex activity that is uniquely microbial, which can be targeted by molecules that do not require translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. The contribution of YcbB to generation of the unusual 3-3 crosslinks that ordinarily constitutes ~ 10% of the <i>E. coli</i> peptidoglycan was discovered by this group in 2008 (<a href=\"#bib11\">8</a>). The present work extends that to show that this activity, combined with an elevation in alarmone ppGpp, PBP1b and DacA expression, are sufficient for complete cell wall biosynthesis in a manner that is resistant to ampicillin inhibition. A main attraction for this theme is the problem of antibiotic resistance, and this pathway renders the cell ampicillin resistant in vitro."

However, L,D-transpeptidases have a major role in peptidoglycan synthesis in members of the genus <i>Mycobacterium</i> since 70% to 80% of the cross-links are of the 3\u21923 type (1, 2). Bypass of the D,D-transpeptidase activity of the PBPs has occurred in this phylum, although the modification of the peptidoglycan assembly pathway is ancient and most probably not linked to the selective pressure of \u03b2-lactams. The determinants of \u03b2-lactam resistance in the mycobacteria are complex. Resistance is not solely determined by the targets since the mycomembrane limits access of the drugs to the periplasm. In addition, production of a broad spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (BlaC) limits the efficacy of most, if not all, \u03b2-lactams, but BlaC is inactivated by the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor clavulanate (3, 4). Regarding the targets, insertional inactivation of the gene encoding the L,D-transpeptidase Ldt<sub>Mt2</sub> results in increased killing of <i>M. Tuberculosis</i> by the amoxicillin-clavulanate combination (5). However, L,D-transpeptidases are not the only target of \u03b2-lactams in <i>M. Tuberculosis</i> since the essential tetrapeptide is produced by D,D-carboxypeptidases that are inhibited by \u03b2-lactams (6). In conclusion, mycobacteria are the only naturally occurring bacteria in which L,D-transpeptidases have a role in resistance in natural isolates. Of note, we have shown that other members of the <i>Actinomycetales</i> produce a peptidoglycan containing similar amounts of 4\u21923 and 3\u21923 cross-links (7). In these bacteria, the L,D-transpeptidases may contribute to tolerance rather than resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics, which inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis by a mechanism unrelated to that of \u03b2-lactams (7)."

Similar analyses performed by Triboulet <i>et al.</i> (24) with the L,D-transpeptidase of <i>E. faecium</i> (Ldt<sub>fm</sub>) provided similar results with a seemingly lower L,D-transpeptidase to L,D-carboxypeptidase ratio (1.3) and higher overall activity. The differences are however not extensive (&lt; 3 fold) and differences in the assays preclude accurate comparisons. In particular, the two substrates used for Ldt<sub>fm</sub> were exclusively used either as an acyl donor or an acyl acceptor. A similar assay could not be developed for YcbB due to differences in the structure of the peptidoglycan from <i>E. faecium</i> and <i>E. coli</i>. Comparison with D,D-transpeptidases (PBPs) is not feasible since these enzymes are not active with disaccharide peptides, requiring coupling with transglycosylation and use of a lipid II intermediate as the substrate."
