                    "text": "The budding yeast centromere contains Cse4, a specialized histone H3 variant. Fluorescence pulse-chase analysis of an internally tagged Cse4 reveals that it is replaced with newly synthesized molecules in S phase, remaining stably associated with centromeres thereafter. In contrast, C-terminally-tagged Cse4 is functionally impaired, showing slow cell growth, cell lethality at elevated temperatures, and extra-centromeric nuclear accumulation. Recent studies using such strains gave conflicting findings regarding the centromeric abundance and cell cycle dynamics of Cse4. Our findings indicate that internally tagged Cse4 is a better reporter of the biology of this histone variant. Furthermore, the size of centromeric Cse4 clusters was precisely mapped with a new 3D-PALM method, revealing substantial compaction during anaphase. Cse4-specific chaperone Scm3 displays steady-state, stoichiometric co-localization with Cse4 at centromeres throughout the cell cycle, while undergoing exchange with a nuclear pool. These findings suggest that a stable Cse4 nucleosome is maintained by dynamic chaperone-in-residence Scm3."

Fluorescence pulse-chase analysis of an internally tagged Cse4 reveals that it is replaced with newly synthesized molecules in S phase, remaining stably associated with centromeres thereafter. In contrast, C-terminally-tagged Cse4 is functionally impaired, showing slow cell growth, cell lethality at elevated temperatures, and extra-centromeric nuclear accumulation. Recent studies using such strains gave conflicting findings regarding the centromeric abundance and cell cycle dynamics of Cse4. Our findings indicate that internally tagged Cse4 is a better reporter of the biology of this histone variant. Furthermore, the size of centromeric Cse4 clusters was precisely mapped with a new 3D-PALM method, revealing substantial compaction during anaphase. Cse4-specific chaperone Scm3 displays steady-state, stoichiometric co-localization with Cse4 at centromeres throughout the cell cycle, while undergoing exchange with a nuclear pool. These findings suggest that a stable Cse4 nucleosome is maintained by dynamic chaperone-in-residence Scm3."

This so-called \u2018point\u2019 centromere consists of a single nucleosome-like chromatin particle containing Cse4, the yeast ortholog of CENP-A (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stoler et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Meluh et al., 1998</a>). Classic genetic, molecular, and biochemical studies have defined three contiguous centromeric DNA elements CDEI, CDE II, and CDE III that direct assembly of a Cse4 nucleosome by sequence-specific DNA binding factors CBF1 and CBF3 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cai and Davis, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lechner and Carbon, 1991</a>) and Scm3, a Cse4-specific chaperone (<a href=\"#bib10\">Camahort et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mizuguchi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Stoler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Xiao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cho and Harrison, 2011b</a>).

Moreover, live cell microscopy of GFP-tagged Cse4 have variously indicated that the number of Cse4 molecules associated with centromeres may be either several-fold greater than the two Cse4 molecules within a nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib16\">Coffman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lawrimore et al., 2011</a>), or oscillate during mitosis from one to two molecules per centromeric nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shivaraju et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the fundamental composition and stability of the Cse4 nucleosome has been obfuscated by the recent microscopic studies."

We utilize the photoconvertible fluorescent protein tdEos in fluorescence pulse-chase experiments to mark pre-existing Cse4 and document its complete replacement at centromeres with newly synthesized molecules early in S phase. We find that after this transient replacement, Cse4 remains stably associated with centromeres for the rest of the cell cycle, without additional Cse4 deposition in anaphase. Importantly, we show that recent discrepant claims can be attributed to reliance on GFP fusion to the C-terminus of Cse4, which causes impaired cell growth, temperature-dependent lethality, and extra-centromeric nuclear accumulation. By contrast, an insertion of GFP or tdEOS within the unstructured N-terminal tail of Cse4 avoids such deleterious phenotypes. Hence, many of the conflicting properties of C-terminally tagged Cse4 reflect the behavior of functionally impaired protein rather than native Cse4."

(1995)</a> and <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al. (2000)</a> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These workers showed that insertions or deletions within the N-terminal tail do not impose any deleterious growth phenotype at all tested temperatures, as long as a 33-residue essential END domain, that interacts with the Ctf19-Mcm21-Okp1 kinetochore sub-complex, is preserved. Thus, as schematically depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, the flexible N-terminus of Cse4 is well suited to accommodate internal protein tags. In contrast, the extreme C-terminal residues of Cse4 (QFI, aa 227-229, located close to the structured part of the nucleosome [<a href=\"#bib59\">Tachiwana et al., 2011</a>]) mediate recognition by CENP-C (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kato et al., 2013</a>) and an adjoining tag is likely to impair this interaction.

Therefore, for comparison with our internal GFP fusions, we examined a representative C-terminally tagged Cse4-GFP strain (MSY173, obtained from Jennifer Gerton's laboratory; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shivaraju et al., 2012</a>). For this strain, we confirm the presence of fluorescent centromeric clusters, though centromere intensity appears slightly elevated (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, in contrast to internally tagged Cse4, we clearly detect extra-centromeric fluorescence throughout nuclei at every stage of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This difference is confirmed by Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts, showing \u223ctwofold excess of C-terminal over internal Cse4-GFP fusion of comparable size and blotting efficiency (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), while internally tagged Cse4 is present at levels close to wild-type Cse4 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013G</a>). Most importantly, the strain carrying the C-terminal tag shows substantially reduced viability. The C-terminal Cse4-GFP strain exhibits slow growth in rich medium even at 24\u00b0C, and is not viable at 38\u00b0C, while none of the internal fusions have growth defects at either temperature (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that fusion of a fluorescent protein tag to the C-terminus impairs Cse4 function. Accordingly, we only used internal tags to further explore the physiological dynamics of Cse4."

We photoconverted Cse4-tdEos in a metaphase cell to reveal the pair of centromere clusters (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B1</a>). One of those clusters was then photobleached with a pulsed dye laser beam focused to a diffraction-limited spot, without affecting fluorescence of the other cluster (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B2</a>). Upon progression through anaphase, we find that only one red-fluorescent cluster is visible at telophase as well (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B3</a>). This indicates that additional Cse4 deposition did not occur on the bleached cluster, nor did Cse4 exchange between the two clusters. A second photoconversion conducted at the end of the experiment (uncovering additional fluorophores that completed maturation in the meantime) confirms that the targeted cluster remains functional and segregates to the opposite pole (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B4</a>). Hence, our results indicate a compositional stasis for Cse4 after S phase deposition, and do not support a second wave of Cse4 deposition in anaphase."

A resulting plot of the 3D distribution of all independent detections inside an anaphase cell (assembled with ViSP software; <a href=\"#bib22\">El Beheiry and Dahan, 2013</a>) reveals both centromere clusters as compact groups of 20 and 22 tdEos fluorophores (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). These should not be construed to reflect the total number of Cse4 molecules present at the clusters, because incomplete maturation and the initial photobleaching prior to PALM (necessitated by paraformaldehyde-induced conversion\u2014JW, personal communication) leave only a fraction of total fluorophores detectable as single-molecule events. Moreover, the existence of the reversible dark state of red tdEos may cause multiple detections of some fluorophores (<a href=\"#bib3\">Annibale et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Despite this, MFM-PALM localization of individual fluorophores allows estimation of the overall dimensions of centromere clusters. We find that Cse4 clusters in G1 are typically \u223c450 nm across (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,F</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), clearly indicating that their wide-field image (the sum of all individual Airy disks) would significantly exceed the diffraction limit (in this case an Airy disk with FWHM \u223c225 nm). Strikingly, anaphase clusters are more compact and asymmetric, on average approximating an ellipsoid of 350 nm \u00d7 200 nm (still above the diffraction limit\u2014<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,G</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). This change corresponds to \u223cthreefold reduction in the volume of the cluster and thus higher spatial density of centromeres. Frequently, the shortened polar axis coincides with the direction of the mitotic spindle extending between anaphase clusters (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Such substantial dimensions of Cse4 clusters and their compaction in anaphase have important implications for photometric measurements of fluorescence intensity (see below)."

Furthermore, we performed photometric measurements of tetO arrays and centromeric clusters after precise background subtraction. We utilized wavelet filtering (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berry and Burnell, 2011</a>) to separate small scale features (e.g., clusters) from larger patterns (e.g., nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> shows that median intensity of wavelet filtered Cse4-GFP clusters corresponds to \u223c36 GFP molecules.

Comparison of centromeric Scm3 and Cse4 fluorescence in telophase, when the majority of tdEos fluorophores are mature, shows that their intensities closely overlap and follow similar photobleaching curves (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>).

We observed similar growth defects with a FLAG epitope tag as well (GM, unpublished data). The extreme C-terminal residues of Cse4 specify recognition by Mif2, the yeast CENP-C inner kinetochore protein (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kato et al., 2013</a>). Accordingly, a C-terminal fusion is likely to affect such interaction, perturbing kinetochore functionality. Thus, the molecular phenotypes of C-terminally tagged Cse4-GFP reflect properties of functionally impaired Cse4, rather than the native protein. Similarly, partial loss of function was also observed for C-terminally tagged CENP-A/CenH3 in mouse (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kalitsis et al., 2003</a>) and <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schuh et al., 2007</a>)."

On the other hand, the very first epitope tag in Cse4 consisted of an insertion within the N-terminal tail, at codon 81 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stoler et al., 1995</a>). At this location, a GFP tag does not affect Cse4 functionality and cell growth (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2000</a>). We find that even the insertion of tdEos tag (twice the size of GFP) at the same location is well tolerated, causing no detectable growth phenotypes, and similar findings were obtained for up to four GFP copies (R Baker, personal communication). Thus, internally tagged Cse4 fusions should be used in imaging studies as a preferred reporter of the composition and dynamics of centromeric nucleosomes."

Our data elaborate on the S phase deposition of Cse4 reported by <a href=\"#bib47\">Pearson et al. (2004)</a>, by showing this process as a removal of pre-existing Cse4 followed by the deposition of newly synthesized molecules, without recycling of old Cse4. Subsequently, Cse4 remains stably bound to centromeres for the remainder of the cell cycle until the next S phase. Furthermore, targeted photobleaching experiments show no second wave of Cse4 deposition in anaphase. Taken together, our findings provide compelling evidence that Cse4 is replaced in S phase and remains static on centromeres for the rest of the cell cycle. In this context, budding yeast Cse4 has no epigenetic role in kinetochore inheritance, in contrast to the inheritance of CENP-A on regional centromeres of other organisms (<a href=\"#bib21\">De Rop et al., 2012</a>)."

Accordingly, interpretation of fluorescence intensities for proteins undergoing synthesis and exchange at a highly specific moment of the cell cycle requires caution. Furthermore, in conventional microscopy, centromere clusters frequently appear more point-like in anaphase and telophase than in G1, which may give the impression of a rise in fluorescence when viewed against the increased nuclear background caused by C-terminal Cse4-GFP fusions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Joglekar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Aravamudhan et al., 2013</a>). A new super-resolution 3D-PALM approach allowed mapping of the actual spatial distribution of individual Cse4 molecules in the centromere cluster, indicating that it should not be treated as a point source for photometric analysis, and providing resolution superior to previous results based on bulk analysis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Haase et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, 3D-PALM directly reveals that centromere clusters contract in anaphase. This may be a consequence of the hydrodynamic drag of segregating chromosomes, and is consistent with EM tomography showing congregation of the plus ends of spindle microtubules during anaphase (<a href=\"#bib46\">O'Toole et al., 1999</a>). Such compaction of centromere clusters leads to \u223cthreefold higher spatial density of centromeres, increasing the likelihood that individual Cse4 molecules on separate centromeres come into proximity sufficient for FRET. This may explain the higher FRET efficiency reported in anaphase (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shivaraju et al., 2012</a>) as interactions between centromeres, without the need to invoke structural oscillation of the centromeric nucleosome between hemisome and octasome."

In contrast, the use of C-terminally tagged Cse4 yielded estimates ranging from 1 to 8 Cse4 molecules per centromere (<a href=\"#bib29\">Joglekar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Coffman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lawrimore et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shivaraju et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Aravamudhan et al., 2013</a>). These discrepant results can be attributed to inaccuracies in estimating spot intensity in the presence of substantial nuclear background, failure to account for the full extent of the centromere cluster (which clearly exceeds the diffraction disk, especially in interphase) in the measurement aperture, or treatment of the cluster as a point source with Gaussian intensity distribution. Interestingly, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments demonstrated that the C-terminal Cse4-GFP fusion is deposited on centromeres as a pair during S phase, and the fluorescence intensity of a \u2018lagging\u2019 centromere in a dicentric chromosome at anaphase is consistent with the presence of two Cse4-GFP molecules (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aravamudhan et al., 2013</a>).

This steady-state centromeric occupancy is the result of continuous dynamic exchange, on a timescale of several minutes, with a large nuclear pool of free Scm3 molecules. Such exchange was also observed by <a href=\"#bib37\">Luconi et al. (2011)</a> in anaphase, although authors did not reliably observe Scm3 in other stages of the cell cycle. Scm3 may dissociate stochastically, and re-associate onto centromeres through interactions with Ndc10 and AT-rich <i>CEN</i> DNA (<a href=\"#bib64\">Xiao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cho and Harrison, 2011a</a>). This dynamic property explains the lack of Scm3 in biochemical purifications of kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib60\">Westermann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akiyoshi et al., 2009</a>), its absence as a stable component of reconstituted Cse4 octasome (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dechassa et al., 2011</a>) and fluctuations in measurements of Scm3 occupancy by ChIP (<a href=\"#bib37\">Luconi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mishra et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shivaraju et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Xiao et al., 2011</a>). As a Cse4-specific histone chaperone, Scm3 needs not, in principle, be retained at centromeres once assembly of the centromeric nucleosome has been accomplished in S phase. Indeed, biochemical experiments document classic chaperone properties for the conserved Cse4-binding domain of Scm3 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dechassa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shivaraju et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Xiao et al., 2011</a>), and NMR and crystal structures of this domain show that DNA binding by Cse4-H4 in the nucleosome is physically incompatible with continued Scm3 interaction (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cho and Harrison, 2011b</a>). However, full-length Scm3 (containing the Ndc10 and DNA binding domains) is enriched at centromeres through all of the cell cycle stages (<a href=\"#bib64\">Xiao et al., 2011</a>), consistent with live cell imaging, and genetic studies suggesting the importance of Scm3 after Cse4 deposition (<a href=\"#bib10\">Camahort et al., 2007</a>). Steady-state occupancy with dynamic exchange has been described for other chromatin proteins, notably the heterochromatin protein HP1, which functions as a platform for assembling gene silencing complexes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cheutin et al., 2003</a>). Thus, it is highly likely that Scm3 remains after deposition of Cse4 to safeguard the integrity of the singular centromeric nucleosome on each budding yeast chromosome."

In G1, a stable Cse4 nucleosome is maintained by steady-state occupancy of Scm3, which would capture and redeposit Cse4-H4 if any stochastic dissociation occurs. Early in S phase, centromeric nucleosomes are disrupted, leading to removal and degradation of old Cse4, with kinetochore detachment (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kitamura et al., 2007</a>). The centromeric nucleosome is then re-established in a step-wise process, most likely starting with binding of CBF1 to CDEI, and CBF3 to CDEIII with assistance of Scm3 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Camahort et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mizuguchi et al., 2007</a>). Subsequently, two Scm3-Cse4-H4 heterotrimers are recruited by Ndc10, the dimeric component of CBF3 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cho and Harrison, 2011a</a>). Scm3 then deposits each Cse4-H4 on <i>CEN</i> DNA through a dimer intermediate to form a (Cse4-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetrasome (<a href=\"#bib20a\">Dechassa et al., 2014</a>). During this step, CDEII DNA out-competes Cse4-H4 contacts with Scm3, which nonetheless remains in close proximity through interactions with Ndc10 and AT-rich <i>CEN</i> DNA. Assembly of two H2A-H2B dimers is likely to follow, although their topography may be altered, as indicated by lack of formaldehyde cross-linking (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mizuguchi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Xiao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Krassovsky et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the stable state of Cse4-nucleosomes is octameric, although transient, sub-octameric intermediates may occur during assembly or disassembly. By remaining in close proximity, Scm3 serves not as a structural replacement for H2A-H2B (contrary to our initial model in <a href=\"#bib42\">Mizuguchi et al. (2007)</a>), but rather as a persistent chaperone-in-residence to insure against catastrophic loss of the singular Cse4 nucleosome. Given that fungal Scm3 orthologs possess a diversity of DNA binding motifs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Aravind et al., 2007</a>), the centromeric persistence of this chaperone through the majority of the <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pidoux et. al, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Williams et al., 2009</a>) or the entirety of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cell cycle (this study) may be a common theme of CENP-A/CenH3 chaperone function. We hope that our findings and clarification of the fates of Cse4 and Scm3 will enable constructive dissection of the mechanisms underlying kinetochore establishment and maintenance to ensure accurate segregation of daughter chromosomes."

The system contained MFM grating (designed to yield 380 nm spacing between consecutive planes in the multifocal image), matching corrective grating/prism, Nikon 100x NA1.4 oil-immersion objective and Andor DU897+ camera (\u221270\u00b0C, EM gain = 250, 70 ms exposure; Andor Technology USA, South Windsor, CT), yielding final image voxel of 120 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 380 nm. Paraformaldehyde-fixed yeast cells were attached to concanavalin A-coated cover slips containing immobilized 550 nm bare Gold Nanorods (25 nm diameter, 550 nm emission; NanoPartz, Loveland, CO; <a href=\"#bib55\">Shtengel et al., 2009</a>). For limited photoconversion, a 405 nm laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) was used at 0.2W/cm<sup>2</sup>, and red tdEos fluorophores were detected under 561 nm laser illumination (2 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>; Cobolt, San Jose, CA). Images were corrected for distortion and transmission, converted into 3D stacks, then individual events were identified and their 3D coordinates determined with FISHQuant (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mueller et al., 2013</a>). Finally, residual 3D drift of the sample was corrected in MatLab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) based on Gold Nanorod fiducials. ViSP software (<a href=\"#bib22\">El Beheiry and Dahan, 2013</a>) was used for visualization and presentation of results.

This paper by Wisniewski et al. on Cse4 (CenH3) represents an important step forward in our understanding of the yeast centromere. In this study, the authors carried out fluorescence pulse-chase experiments with internally-labeled Cse4 and found that preexisting Cse4 is replaced with newly-synthesized Cse4 during S phase in a DNA replication-dependent process. In general, the experiments were carefully performed, and the work has been presented in a lucid and logical manner."
