Thus, our abilities to play a musical instrument, for example, or even just to reach for a cup of coffee without looking up from our computer, all depend on the cerebellum. One of the hallmarks of the cerebellum, which is hidden under the much larger cerebral cortex, is its simple, stereotyped architecture and well-understood circuitry. This simplicity means that analysis of the structure and function of the cerebellum offers neuroscientists the opportunity to understand the basic principles of cortical function."

First, it is able to compare sensory signals (which arise in sensory receptors and report what has happened in the outside world) and motor signals (which are corollaries of the motor commands sent to the spinal cord). Second, \u2018plasticity\u2019 in the cerebellum mediates the learning of motor skills. Here, plasticity refers to changes in the strength of the synapses that allow one neuron to communicate with another, or to changes in the number of action potentials emitted by a neuron when it receives a given set of synaptic inputs."

Plasticity adjusts the strength of each parallel fiber input and attempts to create the correct commands for accurate, skilled movement. Indeed, when inputs from parallel fibers and climbing fibers arrive at a given Purkinje neuron at the same time, the strength of the synapse between the parallel fibers and the Purkinje cell is reduced (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ito et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Linden et al., 1991</a>).

The construct tagged with a red reporter gene was injected into the external cuneate nucleus, which belongs to the pathway that carries proprioceptive sensory information (that is, information about the position of our limbs in space), and the construct tagged with a green reporter gene was injected into the pontine nucleus, which is part of the pathway that carries copies of motor commands from the cortex to the cerebellum. Confocal imaging of the fluorescently tagged mossy fiber projections revealed considerable convergence of the motor and sensory pathways within the cerebellar granule cell layer."

Using high-resolution confocal imaging, they were able to home in on the sparsely labeled granule cells, and to visualize individual mossy fibers terminating on individual granule neuron dendrites (yellow). Remarkably, up to 40% of the granule cells that they analyzed received inputs from both sensory (green) and motor (red) fibers. This is the first evidence for the convergence of sensory and motor afferents at such an early stage of processing."

This raises questions about our current models of cerebellar learning. If learning occurs through changes in the strength of the parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapse, then the early convergence of motor and sensory signals on granule cells means that the cerebellum may have limited ability to adjust the strengths of sensory and motor signals independently. Or, there might be a critical role for plasticity mechanisms at other sites in the cerebellar circuit (<a href=\"#bib3\">Hansel et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Carey and Lisberger, 2002</a>), even at the synapses between mossy fibers and granule cells."

But while the truth may follow the fundamental principles these pioneering authors espoused, it may be more complex than they imagined. Nevertheless, the application of modern biological technology to known neural circuits, as pioneered by Hantman and co-workers, will boost our understanding of how behavior and learning are organized at the circuitry level."
