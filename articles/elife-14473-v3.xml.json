Here we elucidate further the structure of an <i>O</i>-mannose-initiated glycan on alpha-dystroglycan that is required to generate its extracellular matrix-binding polysaccharide. This functional glycan contains a novel ribitol structure that links a phosphotrisaccharide to xylose. ISPD is a CDP-ribitol (ribose) pyrophosphorylase that generates the reduced sugar nucleotide for the insertion of ribitol in a phosphodiester linkage to the glycoprotein. TMEM5 is a UDP-xylosyl transferase that elaborates the structure. We demonstrate in a zebrafish model as well as in a human patient that defects in TMEM5 result in muscular dystrophy in combination with abnormal brain development. Thus, we propose a novel structure\u2014a ribitol in a phosphodiester linkage\u2014for the moiety on which TMEM5, B4GAT1, and LARGE act to generate the functional receptor for ECM proteins having LG domains."

Here we elucidate further the structure of an <i>O</i>-mannose-initiated glycan on alpha-dystroglycan that is required to generate its extracellular matrix-binding polysaccharide. This functional glycan contains a novel ribitol structure that links a phosphotrisaccharide to xylose. ISPD is a CDP-ribitol (ribose) pyrophosphorylase that generates the reduced sugar nucleotide for the insertion of ribitol in a phosphodiester linkage to the glycoprotein. TMEM5 is a UDP-xylosyl transferase that elaborates the structure. We demonstrate in a zebrafish model as well as in a human patient that defects in TMEM5 result in muscular dystrophy in combination with abnormal brain development. Thus, we propose a novel structure\u2014a ribitol in a phosphodiester linkage\u2014for the moiety on which TMEM5, B4GAT1, and LARGE act to generate the functional receptor for ECM proteins having LG domains."

                        "text": "Twenty-five years ago it was proposed that alpha-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG) played a major role in bridging the extracellular matrix to the muscle plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton as a component of the multi-protein dystrophin glycoprotein complex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ervasti et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yoshida and Ozawa, 1990</a>). Defects in the proper formation of this complex have been shown to be causal for various forms of muscular dystrophy (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carmignac and Durbeej, 2012</a>). However, to date, only 3 patients have been found that have primary defects in the coding sequence of \u03b1-DG (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dong et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Geis et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hara et al., 2011</a>). Over fifteen years ago, it was suggested that defects in the glycosyltransferases needed for proper glycosylation of \u03b1-DG were causal for a subset of muscular dystrophies, the so-called secondary dystroglycanopathies that can range in severity from mild Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) to severe Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chiba et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Holt et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wells, 2013</a>). In the early 2000\u2019s, it became clear that the defects causal for disease involved enzymes that initiated and elaborated the extended <i>O</i>-mannose (<i>O</i>-Man) glycan structures covalently attached to Ser/Thr residues of \u03b1-DG (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beltr\u00e1n-Valero de Bernab\u00e9 et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Michele et al., 2002</a>). Since then, steady progress has been made in elucidating the subset of mammalian <i>O</i>-Man structures that directly interact with extracellular matrix components and the candidate genes necessary for the functional glycosylation of \u03b1-DG (<a href=\"#bib39\">Praissman and Wells, 2014</a>). These include the identification of a subset of phosphorylated <i>O</i>-Man structures containing extended, LARGE-dependent, repeating disaccharide polymers, structures that have been recently termed matriglycan (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yoshida-Moriguchi and Campbell, 2015</a>)."

                        "type": "paragraph", 
                        "text": "<i>O</i>-Mannosylation begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (recently reviewed in <a href=\"#bib13\">Dobson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Endo, 2015</a>). The addition of <i>O</i>-Man in an alpha linkage to serine and threonine residues of a select set of mammalian glycoproteins is catalyzed by the POMT1/2 complex using dolichol-phosphomannose as the donor (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beltr\u00e1n-Valero de Bernab\u00e9 et al., 2002</a>). At this point, by mechanisms that have yet to be fully elucidated, there is a divergence in elaboration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The vast majority of <i>O</i>-Man sites are extended in the Golgi in a beta-1,2 linkage with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) by POMGNT1 that can then be further branched by GlcNAc and/or elaborated by galactose, fucose, and sialic acid to generate the M1 and M2 glycans (<a href=\"#bib39\">Praissman and Wells, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yoshida et al., 2001</a>). A small subset of O-Man modified sites, apparently exclusively on \u03b1-DG, are extended in the endoplasmic reticulum by a GlcNAc in a beta-1,4 linkage by POMGNT2 to generate the M3 glycans (<a href=\"#bib33\">Manzini et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013</a>). This is further elaborated into a trisaccharide by the action of a beta-1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) transferase, B3GALNT2 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013</a>). This trisaccharide is a substrate for POMK that phosphorylates the initiating <i>O</i>-Man residue at the 6-position (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013</a>). After unknown elaboration of the phosphotrisaccharide in a phosphodiester linkage, presumably by one or more of the as-yet to be assigned CMD-causing gene products (ISPD, TMEM5, Fukutin, and FKRP), B4GAT1 adds a glucuronic acid (GlcA) in a beta-1,4 linkage to an underlying beta-linked xylose (Xyl) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Praissman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Willer et al., 2014</a>). The addition of the xylose by an unspecified enzyme followed by the action of B4GAT1 serves as a primer for LARGE to synthesize the repeating Xyl-GlcA disaccharide, matriglycan, that serves as the binding site for several extracellular matrix proteins (<a href=\"#bib39\">Praissman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Willer et al., 2014</a>)."

We establish TMEM5 as the candidate xylose transferase and demonstrate the impact of its knockdown in a zebrafish model consistent with a CMD phenotype. We also identify and characterize a novel TMEM5 mutation identified in a WWS family.

We previously demonstrated that the generation of peptides bearing the phosphotrisaccharide could be isolated from \u03b1-DG constructs following cleavage of the phoshodiester linkage and that such treatment resulted in loss of IIH6 (an antibody that binds functionally glycosylated \u03b1-DG) binding (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2010</a>). Thus, we decided to interrogate the released glycan portion to further elucidate the functional glycan structure. Following aqueous HF treatment, which selectively cleaves phosphodiesters, released glycans were isolated from \u03b1\u2013DG-340 and permethylated. Tandem mass spectrometry of the permethylated glycans revealed the presence of a linear pentitol-Xyl-GlcA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) as well as further disaccharide extended structures (pentitol-(Xyl-GlcA)n, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Our rationale for this was that mutations in ISPD are causal for CMD (<a href=\"#bib46\">Roscioli et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Willer et al., 2012</a>), ISPD is a putative nucleotidyltransferase found in the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vuillaumier-Barrot et al., 2012</a>), and homologs in bacterial systems are involved in the generation of identical, CDP-ribitol (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baur et al., 2009</a>), or similar structures, 4-CDP-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib42\">Richard et al., 2001</a>). ISPD was expressed as a His fusion protein in HEK293F cells and purified from whole cell extracts (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The enzyme was capable of generating CDP-ribitol or CDP-ribose using CTP and ribitol-5-phosphate or ribose-5-phosphate, respectively, but was not able to generate the sugar (alcohol) nucleotides with ribitol or ribose (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Thus, ISPD is a CDP-ribitol (ribose) pyrophosphorylase that generates the needed reduced sugar (alcohol) nucleotide for integration of a ribitol into the functional O-Man glycan structure. During the preparation of our manuscript, a study was published demonstrating that CDP-ribose, CDP-ribitol, and CDP-ribulose could all be generated by mammalian ISPD consistent with our present findings (<a href=\"#bib44\">Riemersma et al., 2015</a>)."

We also wanted to confirm the open ring structure enforced by the addition of ribitol, a reduced sugar. In such a linear structure, mild periodate treatment would be expected to cleave vicinal diols and release matriglycan from the polypeptide. Thus, we performed mild periodate cleavage of the purified \u03b1-DG-340 protein and demonstrated a loss of reactivity with the IIH6 antibody that recognizes functional LARGE-modified glycoprotein (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, following tryptic cleavage, we examined the resulting \u03b1-DG peptides by tandem mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We were able to identify multiple glycopeptides where Thr317 (a known site for M3 glycans) was modified to indicate a cleaved ribitol fragment on the phosphotrisaccharide. We observed pairs of essentially identical glycopeptides that showed cleavage between C2 and C3 or between C3 and C4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We also observed peptides with an additional phosphate suggesting that there can be 2 phosphates on the trisaccharide of which at least one is in a phosphodiester linkage to ribitol (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Thus, the ribitol appears most likely to be connected at C1 to the oxygen of a phosphate group on the M3 glycopeptide and at the C5 to xylose (note that ribitol C1 and C5 are indistinguishable due to the nature of the reduced sugar and thus nomenclature for closed-ring standard sugar nucleotides is being used to describe linkage)."

Specifically, at least 12 tryptic peptides were identified at less than 9 ppm mass accuracy that contained the phosphotrisaccharide with a ribitol fragment at threonine 317 (the red T*) in two separate analyses. These peptides differed in additional glycosylation by either hexose (Hex) or HexNAc sugars at additional hydroxyl amino acids (indicated by #). We also observed that the N-terminal glutamine was cyclized to pyroglutamic acid on some peptides (Pyro) and that some glycopeptides were sodiated (Na). Furthermore, we noticed the presence of a second phosphate on some phosphoglycopeptides. The 12 peptides observed are grouped by having the same number of additional Hex and HexNAc glycans (2,3 or 3,3 or 2,4).

Among the uncharacterized genes harboring mutations in patients with CMD, TMEM5 shows sequence similarity to glycosyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vuillaumier-Barrot et al., 2012</a>). <i>TMEM5</i> was also among the genes uncovered in a screen for loss of IIH6 binding and Lassa virus entry, readouts that are both dependent on functional glycosylation of \u03b1-DG (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jae et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we investigated this enzyme as a candidate xylose transferase. We overexpressed and purified the truncated catalytic domain fused to GFP and a His tag (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Using the UDP-Glo assay, we were able to show that transmembrane deleted dTM-TMEM5 can hydrolyze UDP-Xyl, but not other UDP-sugars (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) demonstrating selective hydrolytic activity in the absence of acceptor glycans. Furthermore, we were able to show that recombinant full length TMEM5 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) can be used to label \u03b1-DG-Fc340 (Fc-tagged \u03b1-DG-340) with radiolabeled UDP-Xyl [Xyl-<sup>14</sup>C] expressed from <i>TMEM5-</i>deficient patient cells compared to \u03b1-DG-Fc340 mutated at the M3 site (TPT,\u00a0317\u2013319, converted to APA) as a negative control (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Also, we were able to show that dTM-TMEM5 can use UDP-Xyl to transfer Xyl to CDP-ribitol as the acceptor but not ribitol, ribitol-5-P, or CMP-Neu5Ac suggesting the need for the ribitol to be in a phosphodiester linkage in order to be an acceptor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In summary, these results provide strong, but not direct, evidence that TMEM5 is the xylosyl transferase enzyme for modification of ribitol that is in a phosphodiester linkage to the M3 glycan on \u03b1-DG."

To investigate the role of TMEM5 in vertebrates, we knocked down the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) orthologue using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO). The endogenous zebrafish <i>tmem5</i> transcript was detected throughout early embryonic development (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Injection of <i>tmem5</i> MO specifically inhibited the expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged TMEM5 in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Knockdown of <i>tmem5</i> caused an increased percentage of embryos with mild to severe hydrocephalus (95% in total) and significantly reduced eye size, reminiscent of pathological defects in WWS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To test whether the brain and eye abnormalities were caused by MO off-target effects mediated through a p53-dependent cell death pathway (<a href=\"#bib45\">Robu et al., 2007</a>), we inhibited p53 activation by co-injection of <i>p53</i> MO. 88% of embryos still displayed hydrocephalus and significantly reduced eye size was still observed in embryos co-injected with <i>p53</i> and <i>tmem5</i> MOs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), suggesting that the brain and eye abnormalities were not caused by MO off-target effects. As knockdown of <i>tmem5</i> also caused reduced motility and lesions in the myotome (data not shown), we assessed the sarcolemma integrity using Evans Blue dye (EBD), which does not penetrate into intact muscle fibers. Muscle fibers were infiltrated by EBD before undergoing degeneration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), suggesting a pathological mechanism in which knockdown of <i>tmem5</i> leads to compromised sarcolemma integrity. As defective glycosylation of \u03b1-DG is a pathological hallmark of WWS, we tested whether knockdown of zebrafish <i>tmem5</i> would affect the glycosylation of \u03b1-DG. Compared to control embryos, knockdown of <i>tmem5</i> caused a 44% reduction of glycosylated \u03b1-dystroglycan (IIH6 epitope) on Western blots (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Together, these results clearly illustrate a role for TMEM5 in functional glycosylation of \u03b1-DG and knockdown of this enzyme generating a CMD phenotype in vertebrates."

To investigate if one of the unidentified consanguineous WWS families was affected by a mutation in <i>TMEM5</i> we performed linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing (WES) in three siblings (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

The loss of receptor function and shift of \u03b1-DG core protein to lower molecular weight was confirmed in skeletal muscle (P1, <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), as well as in cultured skin fibroblast samples (P2, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). To demonstrate the pathogenicity of the identified <i>TMEM5</i> mutations, we conducted complementation assays on skin fibroblasts derived from the first child (P1). In the patient cells, expression of wildtype <i>TMEM5</i> fully restored functional glycosylation while the p.G333R mutant protein did not (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Functional rescue of patient cells supports the interpretation that TMEM5 p.G333R has pathogenic relevance and causes WWS. Furthermore, we determined whether the identified TMEM5 p.G333R variant affects expression and localization of the mutant protein. HA-tagged wildtype and p.G333R <i>TMEM5</i> constructs were transfected into in HEK293 cells. Immunofluorescence and co-localization with a Golgi marker Giantin confirmed that both proteins are expressed and localize to the Golgi apparatus without significant ER mislocaliztion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This result shows that the loss of TMEM5 function in the WWS patients is not caused by a cellular processing defect, but rather directly affects the catalytic domain and abrogates the proposed xylose glycosyltransferase activity."

Assuming that this reduced sugar was likely transferred as an activated sugar nucleotide, we attempted to identify a mammalian CDP-ribitol pyrophosphorylase. ISPD was a reasonable candidate since, as a putative cytosolic nucleotidyltransferase (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vuillaumier-Barrot et al., 2012</a>), it is mutated in a subset of CMD and LGMD patients (<a href=\"#bib54\">Willer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cirak et al., 2013</a>), and bacterial homologs participate in the synthesis of CDP activated alcohols (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baur et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Richard et al., 2001</a>). Purified recombinant enzyme was able to synthesize CDP-ribitol from ribitol-phosphate and CTP demonstrating that it is indeed a CDP-ribitol pyrophosphorylase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). During the preparation of our manuscript, a study was published demonstrating that CDP-ribose, CDP-ribitol, and CDP-ribulose could all be generated by mammalian ISPD consistent with our present results (<a href=\"#bib43\">Riemersma et al., 2015</a>). These findings also lend themselves to considering the source of ribitol-P in mammals that likely is generated from ribose-5-phosphate, from the pentose phosphate pathway, by the action of aldose reductase (<a href=\"#bib38\">Perl et al., 2011</a>). Alternatively, given that ISPD can act on ribitol-phosphate and ribose-phosphate, it is possible that the reduction occurs after the formation of the sugar nucleotide CDP-ribose to form CDP-ribitol. Further investigation of kinetic constants and cellular abundances need to be pursued to determine the order of events. Furthermore, no CDP-ribitol transporter into the secretory pathway has been identified yet. Given the facts that mutations in SLC35A1, a proposed CMP-sialic acid transporter, have been implicated in decreased functional glycosylation of \u03b1-DG that is independent from sialic acid (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jae et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Riemersma et al., 2015</a>) and that sugar nucleotide transporters often have higher selectivity for the nucleotide than the sugar, it is inviting to speculate that SLC35A1 is a CDP-ribitol transporter though this remains to be formally tested."

Further, we wanted complementary experimental evidence that would be consistent with the phosphodiester cleavage study that the ribitol was connected directly to the phosphotrisaccharide of \u03b1-DG. Both reduced and non-reduced glycans are susceptible to cleavage by mild periodate treatment between vicinal diols (<a href=\"#bib11\">Collins et al., 1997</a>). If ribitol was indeed inserted between the phosphotrisaccharide and the priming xylose, one would expect loss of IIH6 reactivity from the \u03b1-DG-340 fusion protein as we observed (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis of the resulting peptides revealed cleavage between carbons 2\u20133 and between 3\u20134 of the ribitol (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We also observed phosphotrisaccharide glycopeptides with an additional phosphate moiety suggesting that the M3 trisaccharide can have 2 phosphates connected directly to it (one is at the 6-position of Man and the other we could not resolve). These data are highly suggestive that an M3 phosphate oxygen is connected to the C1 carbon while the xylose is connected to the C5 carbon of the ribitol (note that given the structure of ribitol, C1 and C5 are equivalent and thus we have chosen to use a numbering system that is most consistent with other sugar nucleotides) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

Given that mutations in <i>TMEM5</i> have recently been described as being causal for CMD and that the putative enzyme shows sequence homology to glycosyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vuillaumier-Barrot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jae et al., 2013</a>), we explored the possibility that TMEM5 was a xylose transferase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). We were able to confirm that recombinant TMEM5 was able to hydrolyze UDP-Xyl but not other UDP-sugars. We also observed that while ribitol and ribitol-5-P were not acceptors in vitro that CDP-ribitol was an acceptor for TMEM5 catalyzed transfer of Xyl from UDP-Xyl likely due to mimicking the phosphodiester linkage of the ribitol in the glycopeptide structure. Further, recombinant TMEM5 was able to transfer radiolabeled Xyl from UDP-Xyl to \u03b1-DG-Fc340 expressed in a CMD patient cell line with a homozygous mutation in <i>TMEM5</i> but was not able to effectively transfer to \u03b1-DG-340 when the putative M3 sites (TPT,\u00a0317\u2013319, converted to APA) were eliminated. This data taken together strongly suggests that TMEM5 adds Xyl to ribitol when the ribitol is in a phosphodiester linkage. Given the scarcity of studies on TMEM5, we further characterized the functional relevance of TMEM5 in a zebrafish knockdown model and observed a severe CMD phenotype (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Further, we identified a novel p.G333R TMEM5 mutation in a consanguineous family with 2 children affected by WWS. We demonstrated that wildtype TMEM5 but not the p.G333R TMEM5 mutant construct could complement the mutation in the patient cell line with regards to functional \u03b1-DG (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Subcellular localization studies showed normal expression and localization of the mutant protein, suggesting that the p.G333R missense mutation in the predicted catalytic site likely interferes with enzymatic activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Thus, we propose that TMEM5 modifies the ribitol in a phosodiester linkage with a xylose and B4GAT1 then extends the structure with a GlcA to serve as a primer for LARGE extension with the repeating Xyl-GlcA disaccharide, matriglycan."

While we have further elucidated a functional glycan structure required for interaction with extracellular matrix proteins, several questions remain. For instance, while we have postulated that FKRP and/or Fukutin are involved in the transfer of ribitol using CDP-ribitol as the donor, we have not formally tested this activity due primarily to technical difficulties with expressing these two proteins. Also, while we have confirmed that TMEM5 is a xylose transferase that can add to a ribitol that is in a phosphodiester linkage, we have not experimentally validated its transfer to a ribitol-phosphotrisaccharide modified peptide for the same reasons as above. Furthermore, the generation of the functional glycan in quantities necessary to assign anomeric configurations and confirm linkages in the structure is still required. During the revision of this manuscript, a manuscript was published that addresses many of our outstanding questions (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kanagawa et al., 2016</a>). In particular, Toda and colleagues were able to establish that Fukutin acts to add a ribitol-P in a phosphodiester linkage to the GalNAc of the phosphotrisaccharide that is then extended with an additional ribitol-P by FKRP before elaboration with Xyl by an unknown enzyme (shown here to be TMEM5) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kanagawa et al., 2016</a>).

The evolution of such a complex biosynthetic pathway for a few sites on a single protein is an enigma. Understanding this exclusivity as well as the role of M1 and M2 glycans in biology is a major future challenge. In closing, we have defined the role of additional enzymes in the <i>O</i>-Mannosylation pathway and further elucidated a functional glycan structure on \u03b1-DG for binding to ECM proteins that is lacking in many secondary and tertiary dystroglycanopathies."

Buffer A was 0.1% formic acid, buffer B was 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The column was heated to 45\u00b0C, equilibrated for 5 min, and a linear gradient from 5%B to 45%B was run over the course of 120 min with a 300\u00a0\u03bcl/min flow rate. The column was cleaned after each run by ramping to 99%B for 10 min and then returning to 5%B to re-equilibrate.

Peptide MIPs, charge state selection allowing for states 2\u20137, dynamic exclusion for 30\u00a0s after 2 selections with tolerance of 15\u00a0ppm on each side, and precursor priority of MostIntense were used. All MS2 and MS3 scans were analyzed in the ion trap. One branch consisted of CID scans with pseudo-loss triggered CID and HCD for phosphate, hexose and hexnac combinations with either no charge loss or a charge loss of +1. A second branch consisted of an HCD node leading to product ion triggered ETD given the observation of at least 3 oxonium ions generated by either hexose or hexnac with at least 20% relative intensity. ETD nodes were typically set for reaction times of 100\u2013200\u00a0ms, ETD reagent targets of 2e5 or 4e5 and supplemental activation (primarily EThcD) depending on m/z. Higher m/z ions were subjected to to 40%\u201345% supplemental activation to disrupt low charge density clusters.

Previous work from the Campbell and Wells labs has reported structural characterization of the O-mannose glycans on the mucin domain of \u03b1-DG, and the glycan generated by LARGE, termed matriglycan. The experiments described here propose that ribitol-Xyl-GlcA is the link from the phosphate on O-Mannose to matriglycan. The authors also propose that two genes implicated in CMDs, ISPD and TMEM5, encode a CDP-ribitol pyrophosphorylase and a xylosyltransferase, respectively. They also identify a new mutation in TMEM5 that may be the basis of WWS in a consanguineous family. The work has many strengths, including a comprehensive approach that combines biochemical and structural evaluations, use of in vivo vertebrate (zebrafish) models, and genetic characterization and phenotypic rescue studies in human WWS patients and patient-derived cells, and overall, represents an extremely high quality contribution to our understanding of the assembly of the glycans that modify \u03b1-dystroglycan, and how these enable binding of \u03b1-dystroglycan to ECM proteins. However, there are also a number of 'loose ends', some of which are outlined at the end of the Discussion. Unfortunately, these preclude many of the definitive statements made throughout the manuscript. These issues should be addressed through the essential revisions outlined below."
