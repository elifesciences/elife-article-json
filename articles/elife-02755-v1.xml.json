Although the function of miR-9 has been well characterized in neural progenitors, its role in dendritic and synaptic development remains largely unknown. In order to target miR-9 in vivo, we developed a transgenic miRNA sponge mouse line allowing conditional inactivation of the miR-9 family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Using this novel approach, we found that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-9-mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth."

Although the function of miR-9 has been well characterized in neural progenitors, its role in dendritic and synaptic development remains largely unknown. In order to target miR-9 in vivo, we developed a transgenic miRNA sponge mouse line allowing conditional inactivation of the miR-9 family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Using this novel approach, we found that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-9-mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth."

Dendrites are the main site of information input into neurons. The architecture of the dendritic tree and the targeting of dendrites into appropriate territories critically shape the input properties of neurons and are therefore of profound importance for the establishment of neuronal networks (<a href=\"#bib56\">London and Hausser, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Mumm et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Parrish et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Spruston, 2008</a>). The most relevant synaptic specialization of dendrites is dendritic spines. These actin-rich, structurally plastic protrusions represent the major sites of excitatory synaptic contact (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bonhoeffer and Yuste, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hering and Sheng, 2001</a>). The development of both, dendrites and spines, represents a multistep process influenced by external signals and intrinsic genetic programs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jan and Jan, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Wong and Ghosh, 2002</a>). Emerging data suggest that specific miRNAs exert critical regulatory functions during neuronal differentiation by controlling developmental gene expression programs driving dendritic and spine maturation (<a href=\"#bib79\">Schratt et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fiore et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Parrish et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Magill et al., 2010</a>)."

They are particularly enriched in the nervous system where they have been shown to influence neuronal development and function (<a href=\"#bib30\">Giraldez et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Schratt et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Han et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, miR-9 is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the developing and adult brain (<a href=\"#bib51\">Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Krichevsky et al., 2003</a>). In mammals, miR-9 precursors are encoded by three genes, <i>miR-9-1</i>, <i>miR-9-2,</i> and <i>miR-9-3</i>, located in different chromosomes. After processing, these paralogous transcripts give rise to a unique mature miR-9. Although the function of miR-9 is well established in neural precursors (<a href=\"#bib52\">Leucht et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Zhao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Delaloy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bonev et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Coolen et al., 2012</a>), its role in differentiated neurons is largely unknown. This is surprising since miR-9 levels are higher in mature neurons than in neural precursors (<a href=\"#bib53\">Liu et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that important biological processes beyond proliferation or specification are regulated by miR-9. Recently, a role for miR-9 in axonal extension and branching has been described (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dajas-Bailador et al., 2012</a>), indicating the importance of miR-9 in the establishment of neuronal networks. However, the involvement of this microRNA in the later stages of neuronal development remains unexplored."

When expressed at high levels, miRNA sponges act as specific competitive inhibitors by binding and sequestering the miRNA of interest. In addition, miRNA sponges can be used to monitor miRNA activity when expressed together in the same transcript with a fluorescent protein gene, which is downregulated upon the binding of the miRNA (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ebert et al., 2007</a>)."

In addition, a large proportion of microRNA genes from different families are clustered and expressed as polycistronic transcripts (<a href=\"#bib64\">Olena and Patton, 2010</a>). Therefore, it is a major challenge to develop KO models for miRNA genes, since the targeted deletion of a miRNA might affect overlapping protein-coding or lncRNA genes, or alter the expression of neighbor miRNAs, clustered in the same genomic region. Furthermore, many miRNAs have seed family members encoded at multiple distant loci, which requires that multiple genes have to be simultaneously knocked-out to obtain full ablation and avoid gene compensations based on functional redundancy. These obstacles severely limit the use of conditional targeting strategies, usually based on the Cre-<i>loxP</i> system, for the study of miRNA function."

Using the latter, we revealed a novel developmental role of miR-9 in the postmitotic differentiation of neurons, as a key regulator of dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, we show that regulation of the transcriptional repressor REST by miR-9 is essential for normal dendritic maturation."

The specificity of the miR-9 sponge was further confirmed, as miR-9 overexpression rescued the phenotype induced by the GFP-FC-miR-9 sponge (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). miR-9*, encoded by the same miRNA precursor as miR-9, has been postulated to contribute to activity-dependent dendritic growth, although no direct evidence was shown (<a href=\"#bib95\">Yoo et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, expression of FC sponges directed to miR-9* showed no effects on dendritic growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). In addition, we found that miR-9 overexpression in hippocampal neurons did not affect total dendritic length and had only a mild impact on dendritic complexity (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that miR-9, but not miR-9*, participates in the developmental programs controlling dendritic growth and that endogenous mir-9 levels have a saturating effect of on dendritic maturation."

The reporter function relies on the miR-9-induced GFP downregulation of the sponge transcript. However, an often underestimated problem of sponge-based reporters is the impossibility to distinguish between a truly downregulated signal reporting miR-9 activity and a non-specific lack of sponge expression due to promoter a inactivity or locus silencing. We therefore developed a reporter mouse line encoding a fluorescent tdTomato control protein in the other allele of the <i>R26</i> locus (see details in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The tdTomato transgene acts as a control allele since it is located in the same locus and is also driven by a CAG promoter. The absence of GFP signal would therefore imply miR-9 activity only if the tdTomato signal is present, excluding lack of expression of the sponge transgene. Histological evaluation of the miR-9-Sp/tdTomato reporter mouse line revealed a strong signal for both proteins in most organs, indicating the absence of miR-9 activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Lack of expression of both transgenes was observed in seminiferous tubules and in follicular cells of the ovary due to either silencing of the <i>R26</i> locus or inactivity of the CAG promoter. Interestingly, we observed a scattered population of GFP-negative/tdTomato-positive hepatocytes, suggesting that a subpopulation of liver cells express miR-9."

To address this question, we expressed the GFP-FC-miR-9 sponge in a subset of sparse CA1 neurons by in utero electroporation. Hippocampal neural precursors of E14.5 wild-type embryos were transfected with a plasmid expressing mRFP (volume marker) together with either a GFP-FC-miR-9 expressing construct or a GFP spongless control plasmid. Total dendritic length and dendrite complexity were analyzed 1 month after birth. In utero gene transfer of GFP-FC-miR-9-sponge plasmids resulted in changes comparable to those observed in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice. These results demonstrate that the dendritic changes observed with stable ablation of miR-9 are essentially cell autonomous and not caused by changes of cell extrinsic factors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>)."

                                "text": "Alterations in dendrite complexity occurring during development might induce structural or functional compensatory mechanisms at the synaptic level in order to preserve the functionality and computational power of the postsynaptic neuron (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kolb et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dieni and Rees, 2003</a>). We first investigated dendritic spine density of CA1 hippocampal neurons in miR-9 Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> Thy1<sup><i>EGFP</i></sup> mice. No effects were observed in spine density or morphology compared to littermate controls (miR-9-Sp<sup>fl-Stop</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). To assess the strength of synaptic transmission in pyramidal hippocampal neurons, we performed field recordings in acute hippocampal slices and analyzed the neural transmission at Schaffer collaterals-CA1 synapses. The size of the presynaptic fiber volley (FV) was compared with the slope of the EPSP in the <i>stratum radiatum</i>. We found that synaptic transmission was significantly reduced in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice compared to miR-9-Sp<sup>fl-Stop</sup> littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,I</a>). Interestingly, during the course of our experiments, we noted that higher stimulus intensities were required in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice to elicit the same FV amplitude (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). This prompted us to directly test the excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells. In current-clamp recordings we observed a shift of the action potential (AP) threshold to more positive membrane potentials in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K,L</a>). In turn, the same current injected elicited fewer APs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4M</a>). The input resistance was not changed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4N</a>). If pyramidal neurons are less excitable and therefore generate fewer APs, we should observe a reduced frequency of spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSC). Indeed, the mean sEPSC frequency was largely reduced in CA1 neurons of sponge-expressing animals (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A,C</a>). The reduced sEPSC amplitude (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) could be caused by the reduced number of AP driven events; however, to test whether the quantal size is reduced in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice, we recorded miniature EPSCs (mEPSC). Here, mEPSC amplitude and frequency were significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3D\u2013F</a>). The reduced frequency reflects the reduced number of synapses, while the reduced mEPSC amplitude indicates a change in quantal size. To exclude presynaptic effects, we tested paired-pulse facilitation, a sensitive measure of changes in the probability of transmitter release, which was unchanged (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3G</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that the impaired synaptic transmission is caused by a reduction in the absolute number of synapses per neuron (with preserved synapse density), resulting from the shortened dendrites in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice. Additionally, inhibiting miR-9 affects neuronal excitability by changing the AP threshold."

However, this is not evident from REST loss-of-function models. Conditional deletion of <i>Rest</i> in early neural progenitors in <i>Rest</i><sup>Sox1\u2212Cre</sup> mice, did not affect brain histology and had no impact on the expression of REST-target genes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Aoki et al., 2012</a>). In agreement, we found no difference in dendritic development between shREST- and shControl-transfected neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The efficiency of shREST constructs to downregulate REST was assessed in HEK-293 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Together with the lack of phenotype observed in <i>Rest</i><sup>Sox1\u2212Cre</sup> mice, these results suggest that the transcriptional repressive activity of endogenous REST is minimal in neurons. Since REST is strongly downregulated during neuronal development, we next hypothesized that maintenance of high levels of this transcriptional repressor might be detrimental for neuronal development and that, consequently, a key function of miR-9 would be to keep low REST levels across neuronal maturation. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found that overexpression of REST in primary hippocampal neurons significantly reduces dendritic length and arborization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). In contrast, overexpression of other miR-9 targets that were found to be upregulated in sponge expressing neurons, such as Foxp4, Creb1, and Map1b, had no effect on dendritic length and complexity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that they are not contributing to the dendritic phenotype of miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> neurons."

However, uncovering the function of specific microRNA families has been limited by the lack of technologies for in vivo analysis. Much of our current knowledge regarding the role of microRNAs in neuronal biology stems from overexpression-based studies. However, overexpression approaches may lead to silencing of genes that normally escape regulation resulting in artificial, neomorphic phenotypes. Therefore, loss-of-function strategies are required to validate physiological miRNA functions. The generation of KO mice has several limitations in this context: (i) requires the ablation of the multiple gene copies of miRNAs belonging to the same family, often placed at distant genomic loci and (ii) miRNAs genes are frequently encoded in clusters together with other miRNAs from different families or directly overlapping other protein-coding or lncRNA genes. Therefore, the ablation of the miRNA sequence by gene targeting KO strategies also affects the expression of the \u2018host\u2019 genes coding for proteins or lncRNAs, or miRNA genes from other families encoded in tandem; and (iii) the complementary miRNA* strand is entirely removed by the gene deletion."

In this model, both miR-9 and miR-9* levels are reduced. Unlike other mRNA* species, miR-9* accumulates to substantial levels in vivo (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bak et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Yao et al., 2012</a>), and since miR-9* has a different seed sequence compared to miR-9, it is predicted to regulate a different set of targets. Importantly, miR-9* regulation of BAF53a has been shown to contribute to activity-dependent dendritic growth (<a href=\"#bib95\">Yoo et al., 2009</a>). In addition, two transcripts (C130071C03Rik-001 and C130071C03Rik-201) that overlap with the murine <i>miR-9-2</i> gene and encode for lncRNAs, are deleted in this mouse model. Although the function of these transcripts is still unknown, recent evidence demonstrates that ablation of lncRNA genes can produce severe phenotypes at brain level (<a href=\"#bib77\">Sauvageau et al., 2013</a>), indicating that they would play more critical roles in vivo than previously considered. In view of these facts, other functional products in addition to miR-9 might contribute to the phenotype of <i>miR-9-2</i>/<i>miR-9-3</i> KO mice and further investigations will be required to clarify this issue. In contrast, the use of miR-9 sponges as dominant negative genetic tools, allowed us to dissect the specific role of miR-9 on dendritic and spine development. Previously, miRNA sponges have been proven as useful genetic loss-of-function tools in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib57\">Loya et al., 2009</a>), and non-conditional expression of sponges has been reported in mice (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ma et al., 2011</a>).

However, with these techniques, it is not possible to discriminate between precursor and mature miRNAs. Moreover, the design of the probes is very limited due to the very short sequence of miRNAs, preventing the optimization steps usually necessary to obtain adequately specific and sensitive riboprobes for ISH (<a href=\"#bib74\">Refojo et al., 2011</a>). In this study, we used the reporter function of miRNA sponges that have the advantage of reporting miRNA activity instead of expression. The miR-9-Sp/tdTomato mouse line was used to analyze the activity pattern of miR-9 in the adult mouse brain. We observed high miR-9 activity in neurons and astrocytes and a lower activity in microglial cells. While miR-9 has been detected in microglia (<a href=\"#bib54\">Liu et al., 2013a</a>) and other cells of myeloid origin (<a href=\"#bib80\">Senyuk et al., 2013</a>), findings obtained with a recently developed miR-9 reporter mouse line, miR-9.T, suggest that miR-9 activity is absent in microglia (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akerblom et al., 2013</a>). Lower levels of the PGK-driven GFP-miR-9 sensor transgene may account for the lower sensitivity shown by that mouse model. Although the expression of the sensor is not shown outside the brain, an indication of the low expression of the sensor of miR-9.T mice is that GFP expression could only be analyzed after the enhancement of the signal via immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akerblom et al., 2013</a>), in contrast to our characterization that fully relies on the detection of the native fluorescence of GFP."

In contrast, only few studies have unraveled additional functions of miR-9 at later steps of neural development.

Furthermore, we found that basal synaptic transmission was impaired in miR-9 sponge expressing mice. Since the morphology and density of dendritic spines were not affected, the reduced postsynaptic responses are most likely due to a reduction in the total number of synapses as expected from less-arborized dendrites (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kawabe et al., 2010</a>), as those found in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> mice.

Although a mild effect on neurite outgrowth was reported in cultured retinal ganglion cells upon titration of REST with sequestering plasmids (<a href=\"#bib44\">Koch et al., 2011</a>), we were unable to observe any effect of REST downregulation on the dendritic length or complexity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons during development. In agreement with our results, the conditional deletion of <i>Rest</i> in early neural progenitors had no impact on the expression of REST-target genes in postnatal day 0 brains, when dendrite differentiation is taking place (<a href=\"#bib5\">Aoki et al., 2012</a>).

Therefore, a key function of miR-9 would be to keep low REST levels across neuronal maturation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that REST overexpression in primary neurons has a negative impact on dendritic length and complexity. Importantly, by performing ex vivo gene transfer of REST shRNAs into neural precursors, we determined that the increased REST activity in miR-9 sponge neurons is underlying the impairment in dendritic growth. However, the fact that the rescue of the dendritic defects was extensive but not complete, suggests that other miR-9-regulated proteins may also contribute to the dendritic phenotype of miR-9 sponge expressing neurons. Together, these experiments delineate a central mechanism in which miR-9 restricts REST expression and thereby promotes neuronal postmitotic differentiation. Interestingly, it has been observed that REST levels are restored in some neuronal populations following a biphasic expression (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gao et al., 2011</a>). Consequently, REST expression have been shown to be increased in some adult hippocampal and cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kuwabara et al., 2004</a>), suggesting that miR-9/REST regulation might play other non-developmental roles in some mature neuronal populations."

Individual sequences for each sponge are as follows: FC miR-9 sponge 5\u2032-TCAT-ACAGCTAGATAACCAAAGA-3\u2032; Bg miR-9 sponge 5\u2032-TCATACAGCTATATACCAAAGA-3\u2032; scrambled miR-9 sponge 5\u2032-ATG-ATAACAACGAACGATTACAC-3\u2032; FC miR-9* sponge 5\u2032-ACTTTCGGTTATCTAGCTTTAT-3\u2032; Bg miR-124 sponge 5\u2032-GGCATTCACAAGTGCCTTA-3\u2032.

To generate the luciferase miR-9 sensor, the firefly luciferase cDNA was cloned into the pCRII vector containing the CAG promoter described before. A short sequence containing a single fully complementary binding site to miR-9 was added as 3\u2032UTR.

Concretely, in the reversion experiments depicted in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, we show that the expression of shRNAs against REST rescue the effects triggered by the sponge.

Following the suggestion of the reviewers, we added an additional layer of complexity to the interpretation of the electrophysiology results. In the Discussion section, we mention that even though impairments in neurotransmission are in agreement with neurons bearing less-arborized dendritic trees, a potential contribution of the tandem miR-9/Map1b, which has already been described to be critical for terminal axonal arborization (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dajas-Bailador et al., 2012</a>) might also contribute to the functional phenotypes observed."

As can be observed in the <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response Figure 1</a>, downregulation of Map1b results in the absence of normal dendrites that are replaced by long filopodia-like structures. Unfortunately, due to this strong <i>per se</i> effect, we could not use this tool to evaluate a potential rescue of the dendritic impairment in sponge expressing neurons.

Together with REST, those were the highest upregulated targets found in miR-9-Sp<sup>Nestin-Cre</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We reasoned that if any of those miR-9 targets would contribute to the dendritic phenotype observed in sponge expressing neurons, their overexpression should negatively regulate dendritic growth. In contrast to REST overexpression, we found that increased levels of Foxp4, Creb1 or Map1b had no impact on dendritic length and complexity. These results are now included in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>. It is worth noting that even though the down-regulation of Creb1 sensibly impairs activity-dependent dendritic arborization (Wayman et al., 2006), the forced expression of Creb1 does not trigger the opposite effects. Similar to our results obtained in hippocampal neurons Redmond and colleagues (2002) have sown that Creb1 overexpression in culture cortical neurons during development does not exert any effects on dendritic differentiation."

In addition, we recorded miniature EPSCs (mEPSC). Here, mEPSC amplitude and frequency were significantly reduced. The reduced frequency reflects the reduced number of synapses, while the reduced mEPSC amplitude indicates a change in quantal size.

First, differences in the genetic backgrounds; Thy1-eGFP mice are in a C57BL/6J background while CD1 mice were used for in utero electroporation. Second, and in our view more relevant, the relative high density of transfected neurons in in utero electroporated brains makes sometimes difficult to discriminate between terminal branches belonging to the neuron being traced or to other neighboring neuron. Since these terminal branches from non-clear sources are excluded from the analyses, tracings from these experiments tend to underestimate the real complexity of the neurons, yielding lower values for total dendritic length and neuronal complexity. Since the same criteria apply to both control- and sponge-transfected groups, this does not represent an intrinsic confounding factor in the comparison between these experimental groups."
