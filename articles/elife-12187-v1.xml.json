Here, we use two novel Bub1 inhibitors, BAY-320 and BAY-524, to demonstrate potent Bub1 kinase inhibition both in vitro and in intact cells. Then, we compared the cellular phenotypes of Bub1 kinase inhibition in HeLa and RPE1 cells with those of protein depletion, indicative of catalytic or scaffolding functions, respectively. Bub1 inhibition affected chromosome association of Shugoshin and the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), without abolishing global Aurora B function. Consequently, inhibition of Bub1 kinase impaired chromosome arm resolution but exerted only minor effects on mitotic progression or SAC function. Importantly, BAY-320 and BAY-524 treatment sensitized cells to low doses of Paclitaxel, impairing both chromosome segregation and cell proliferation. These findings are relevant to our understanding of Bub1 kinase function and the prospects of targeting Bub1 for therapeutic applications."

Here, we use two novel Bub1 inhibitors, BAY-320 and BAY-524, to demonstrate potent Bub1 kinase inhibition both in vitro and in intact cells. Then, we compared the cellular phenotypes of Bub1 kinase inhibition in HeLa and RPE1 cells with those of protein depletion, indicative of catalytic or scaffolding functions, respectively. Bub1 inhibition affected chromosome association of Shugoshin and the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), without abolishing global Aurora B function. Consequently, inhibition of Bub1 kinase impaired chromosome arm resolution but exerted only minor effects on mitotic progression or SAC function. Importantly, BAY-320 and BAY-524 treatment sensitized cells to low doses of Paclitaxel, impairing both chromosome segregation and cell proliferation. These findings are relevant to our understanding of Bub1 kinase function and the prospects of targeting Bub1 for therapeutic applications."

This evolutionarily conserved surveillance mechanism monitors the status of kinetochore (KT)-microtubule (MT) interactions and delays anaphase onset until all chromosomes have undergone bipolar attachment to the spindle. Both KT-MT interactions and SAC activity are regulated by several KT-associated protein kinases, including Aurora B, Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) and Budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 (Bub1) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Maciejowski et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Meraldi and Sorger, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Santaguida et al., 2011</a>). SAC activity depends on a diffusible inhibitor of the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), termed mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Musacchio, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Sacristan and Kops, 2015</a>). Once the SAC is silenced in response to chromosome biorientation, APC/C activation then triggers the onset of chromatid separation and mitotic exit, respectively (<a href=\"#bib26\">Funabiki and Wynne, 2013</a>)."

Whether Bub1 phosphorylates Cdc20 in living cells remains to be determined, but recent studies strongly suggest that Bub1 binding to Cdc20 is important for SAC function (<a href=\"#bib17\">Di Fiore et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Vleugel et al., 2015</a>)."

In mammalian cells, several studies point to the conclusion that Bub1 mutants devoid of catalytic activity are able to restore many, albeit not all, aspects of chromosome congression and SAC function (<a href=\"#bib48\">Klebig et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">McGuinness et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Perera and Taylor, 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ricke et al., 2012</a>)."

Using biochemical and cellular assays, we show that these ATP-competitive inhibitors potently and specifically block human Bub1 both in vitro and in living cells. By comparing phenotypes provoked by Bub1 kinase inhibition and Bub1 protein depletion, we are able to differentiate between catalytic and non-catalytic functions of Bub1. Our data indicate that Bub1 catalytic activity is largely dispensable for chromosome alignment and SAC function, arguing that Bub1 largely operates as a scaffolding protein. However, even though Bub1 inhibition per se exerts only minor effects on mitotic fidelity, BAY-320 and BAY-524 treatment sensitizes cells to clinically relevant low doses of Paclitaxel, resulting in remarkable impairment of chromosome segregation and cell proliferation."

In a first series of experiments, we used time-lapse imaging to compare progression through mitosis in asynchronously growing HeLa and RPE1 cells in response to either Bub1 inhibition or siRNA-mediated Bub1 depletion. In line with previous results (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kitajima et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Tang et al., 2004b</a>), depletion of Bub1 from HeLa cells significantly prolonged duration of mitosis, due to delayed chromosome alignment and delays in prometa- and metaphase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In stark contrast, treatment with either BAY-320 or BAY-524 provoked at most minor effects on mitotic progression, marked by a short delay of anaphase onset (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). Furthermore, in contrast to aneuploid HeLa cells, diploid RPE1 cells were not significantly affected by either Bub1 inhibition or depletion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Efficiency of siRNA-mediated depletion was monitored by Western blotting (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Flow-cytometric analyses confirmed that Bub1 depletion from HeLa cells causes an increase in the G2/M population of HeLa but not RPE1 cells and that Bub1 inhibition by BAY-320 or BAY-524 did not detectably affect cell cycle profiles in either cell line (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F and G</a>). We conclude that the\u00a0inhibition of Bub1 kinase activity in either HeLa or RPE1 cells produces at most subtle effects on mitotic progression, whereas Bub1 depletion exerts more profound effects, at least in HeLa cells. These results are consistent with the demonstration that Bub1 kinase activity is not required for the development and viability of mice (<a href=\"#bib71\">Perera and Taylor, 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ricke et al., 2012</a>)."

In particular, depletion of Bub1 was shown to cause persistent arm cohesion and a redistribution of Sgo proteins from centromeres to chromosome arms (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kitajima et al., 2005</a>). To directly demonstrate a role for Bub1 kinase activity in sister chromatid cohesion, we analyzed chromosome spreads prepared from mitotic HeLa cells or RPE1 cells after treatment with Bub1 inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) or Bub1-specific siRNA for comparison (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). While mitotic chromosome spreads from nocodazole-treated control cells showed the expected X-shape structure, indicative of centromere cohesion, most cells treated with either Bub1 inhibitors or Bub1 siRNA showed sister chromatids whose arms remained paired (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, centromeric levels of Sgo1 and Sgo2 were reduced to ~20% of control values in BAY-320 or BAY-524 treated cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D and E</a>) and, concomitantly, a significant redistribution of Sgo2 to chromosome arms could be observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F and G</a>). We thus conclude that Bub1 catalytic activity contributes to the regulation of sister chromatid cohesion and the localization of Sgo proteins."

This prompted us to investigate the impact of Bub1 inhibition on Aurora B localization and activity. Consistent with the marked effects on centromere localization of Sgo1/2, we also observed significant effects of Bub1 inhibition on Aurora B localization. After treatment of HeLa cells with BAY-320 or BAY-524, all CPC subunits examined were partially displaced from centromeres (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). While Bub1 inhibition reduced centromeric levels of Aurora B, Borealin and INCENP by ~50% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>, left panels), depletion of Bub1 lowered centromere levels of these CPC components by ~70% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>, right panels).

This conclusion was corroborated by showing that both inhibition and depletion of Bub1 reduced the centromere association of the Aurora B effector protein MCAK (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrews et al., 2004</a>) by ~50% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a>). Furthermore, use of biosensors for Aurora B activity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fuller et al., 2008</a>) revealed a reduction in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) ratios for sensors tethered to either chromosome arms (through fusion to H2B) or centromeres (through fusion to histone CENP-B) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that Bub1-dependent phosphorylation plays a major role in the regulation of Aurora B localization and activity.

We therefore used an RPE1 cell line expressing one endogenous allele of Aurora B tagged with EGFP (<a href=\"#bib99\">von Schubert et al., 2015</a>) to monitor the subcellular localization of this kinase in living cells. Following Bub1 inhibition, Aurora B-EGFP levels at chromosome arms increased approximately twofold, concomitant with the described reduction of Aurora B at centromeres (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boyarchuk et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ricke et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, this change in localization showed a strong correlation with the redistribution of Sgo2 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). In contrast, treatment of cells with the Haspin inhibitor 5-Iodotubercidin did not induce any significant redistribution of Aurora B from centromeres to chromosome arms; instead, inhibition of Haspin caused an overall reduction of EGFP signals at both centromeres and chromosome arms (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>). Combined inhibition of Bub1 and Haspin displaced Aurora B from both centromeres and chromosome arms (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>), in line with the analysis of fixed cells described above. Taken together, these data corroborate the notion that Bub1 and Haspin cooperate in the recruitment of CPC to centromeres through phosphorylation of histone H2A-T120 and histone H3-T3, respectively. In addition, they reveal a role for Bub1 kinase activity, but not Haspin, in restricting CPC localization to the centromere."

Although our initial analyses had not revealed a major impact of BAY-320 or BAY-524 on the overall timing of mitotic progression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), we considered the possibility that inhibition of Bub1 might provoke compensatory effects on mitotic timing, notably a delay in congression and a concomitant acceleration of mitotic exit. According to such a scenario, effects on timing might conceivably cancel each other. In support of this possibility, we emphasize that the\u00a0inhibition of mitotic kinases with pleiotropic functions have previously been shown to provoke opposing phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib80\">Santaguida et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">von Schubert et al., 2015</a>). To explore the possibility of compensatory effects of Bub1 inhibition, we thus carried out more detailed analyses of mitotic progression, notably KT-recruitment of SAC components, SAC signaling and chromosome congression."

To test the impact of Bub1 catalytic activity on SAC function, we first analyzed KT levels of Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1 in BAY-320 or BAY-524 treated cells. With the possible exception of a very minor effect on BubR1, the localization of none of these SAC proteins was significantly affected by Bub1 inhibition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

In the case of the SAC kinase Mps1, autophosphorylation constitutes a major mechanism for controlling Mps1 levels at KTs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hewitt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Jelluma et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">von Schubert et al., 2015</a>), and a recent study suggests that Bub1 turnover at KTs is also regulated by autophosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asghar et al., 2015</a>). To determine whether Bub1 dynamics at KTs is affected by inhibition of Bub1 activity, we made use of an RPE1 cell line harboring one allele of Bub1 tagged by EGFP at the endogenous locus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). After the\u00a0treatment of cells with nocodazole to assure complete MT depolymerization and full SAC activation (<a href=\"#bib80\">Santaguida et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Yang et al., 2009</a>), Bub1 levels and turnover at KTs were measured by immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), respectively. In comparison to control cells, neither BAY-320 nor BAY-524 detectably affected steady-state Bub1 levels at KTs (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B and C</a>), in line with a recent report (<a href=\"#bib58\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). More importantly, FRAP experiments revealed only minor effects of Bub1 inhibition on Bub1 dynamics at KTs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The extent of fluorescence recovery after FRAP was not significantly different in control cells and inhibitor treated cells, revealing an immobile fraction of ~42%, in excellent agreement with previous data (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asghar et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Howell et al., 2004</a>). The half-time of Bub1 recovery at KTs after FRAP was ~18 sec in controls, again in good agreement with previous data (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asghar et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Howell et al., 2004</a>). However, whereas Asghar and colleagues observed a ~50% reduction in the half-time of recovery of an exogenously expressed, catalytically inactive EGFP-Bub1 mutant, we found that recovery of endogenously tagged wild-type EGFP-Bub1 was only marginally accelerated by Bub1 inhibition (half-time reduced from 18 s to 12\u201315 s) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). When considering this discrepancy, it is important to bear in mind that our data reflect turnover of chemically inhibited wild-type Bub1 expressed at endogenous levels, whereas Ashghar and colleagues monitored mutant versions of overexpressed Bub1, raising the possibility that their results may have been influenced by expression levels and/or mutation-induced structural alterations. We conclude that the effects of Bub1 activity on Bub1 turnover at KTs are at most minor, particularly when compared to the striking effects of Mps1 activity on Mps1 dynamics at KTs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hewitt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Jelluma et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">von Schubert et al., 2015</a>)."

Over a 24\u2009hr observation period, the percentage of HeLa cells maintaining a SAC arrest dropped from 17% in controls to 4% and 2% in response to Bub1 inhibition by BAY-320 and BAY-524, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, left panel). These shifts in cell fates were largely compensated by increases in the percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis, from 74% in controls to 94% in Bub1-inhibited cells. In contrast, although the duration of mitosis was slightly reduced upon Bub1 inhibition, the extent of mitotic slippage remained at less than 10% under all conditions. In RPE1 cells, maintenance of SAC arrest over 24\u2009hr was more pronounced, but again the percentage of arrested cells dropped from 61% in controls to 51%/44% in response to Bub1-inhibition, with increasing proportions of cells undergoing apoptosis or mitotic slippage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, left panel). For comparison, depletion of Bub1 from either HeLa or RPE1 cells resulted in a 2\u20133 fold increase in mitotic slippage at the expense of apoptosis, while the proportion of cells sustaining an arrest remained roughly constant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D and E</a>, right panels). Collectively, these results indicate that Bub1 activity contributes to the\u00a0maintenance of maximal SAC activity, but that Bub1 protein levels are more important, most likely reflecting the observed role of Bub1 in the KT recruitment of SAC components (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

In agreement with the results described above, Bub1 inhibition marginally reduced the time that Reversine-treated cells remained arrested before overriding nocodazole-induced arrest (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F and G</a>, left panels). Addition of Aurora B or Plk1 inhibitors, used as positive controls, led to the expected shortening of the duration of mitotic arrest (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F and G</a>, left panels) (<a href=\"#bib81\">Saurin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">von Schubert et al., 2015</a>).

While nearly 28% of Bub1-depleted cells failed to completely align all chromosomes, more than 90% of Bub1-inhibited cells showed complete alignment that was indistinguishable from control cells. Inhibition of Aurora B, analyzed for control, resulted in the expected impairment of alignment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a>). To complement these assays, we also used immunofluorescence microscopy to quantify the frequency of micronucleation, a read-out for chromosome segregation errors, in HeLa and RPE1 cells. While partial inhibition of Aurora B kinase provoked an increase in micronucleation in both cell lines, as expected (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gohard et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Tao et al., 2009</a>), Bub1 inhibition only marginally increased the frequency of micronucleation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). This result supports the view that Bub1 inhibition causes surprisingly mild defects in chromosome congression or segregation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7A</a>). Further corroborating this conclusion, we found that BAY-320 or BAY-524 treatment exerted no significant effects on the kinetochore recruitment of the motor protein CENP-E (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D and E</a>, left panels). In contrast, Bub1 depletion reduced CENP-E levels at KTs by ~40% (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D and E</a>, right panels), in agreement with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib40\">Johnson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Sharp-Baker and Chen, 2001</a>). Taken together, these results show that Bub1 kinase activity is largely dispensable for chromosome congression and segregation. It follows that even though Bub1 inhibition results in a marked reduction of Aurora B levels at centromeres (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), these levels are still sufficient to ensure largely faithful chromosome segregation. Conversely, Bub1 protein is clearly important for efficient chromosome congression, presumably reflecting the role of Bub1 in CENP-E recruitment to KTs."

Thus, we asked how inhibition of Bub1 kinase activity by BAY-320 or BAY-524 would impact on cells in which MT dynamics was compromised by low doses of Paclitaxel. Importantly, when used at clinically relevant doses of 1\u20134 nM, Paclitaxel induces spindle defects and aneuploidy without delaying mitotic progression (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brito and Rieder, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen and Horwitz, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ikui et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Janssen et al., 2009</a>). While single treatment with 1\u20134 nM Paclitaxel produced modest impairment of cell proliferation, the concomitant application of the Bub1 inhibitors, BAY-320 at 3 \u03bcM or BAY-524 at 7 or 10 \u03bcM, clearly exacerbated inhibition of proliferation. Effects were particularly drastic in aneuploid HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and B</a>, top panels), while diploid RPE1 cells were less affected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and B</a>, bottom panels). For comparison, we also examined the effects of combining low dose Paclitaxel treatment with partial inhibition of Mps1 by Reversine (<a href=\"#bib36\">Janssen et al., 2009</a>). This analysis shows that the combination of Paclitaxel with either Mps1 or Bub1 inhibition produced similar synergistic effects, albeit with cell-type specific differences (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and B</a>). Using extensive dose-response analyses, synergy between BAY-320 and Paclitaxel treatment was further confirmed for both HeLa (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) and non-small cell lung cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>).

Following application of the above Paclitaxel and Bub1/Mps1 inhibitor treatments, the frequencies of chromosomal defects were monitored by fluorescence time-lapse imaging and quantified (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Consistent with the micronucleation data described above (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), Bub1 inhibition alone did not significantly elevate the frequency of chromosome missegregation in either HeLa or RPE1 cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). For comparison, interference with the SAC by inhibition of Mps1 led to a marked increase in segregation defects in both cell lines, as expected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Most importantly, HeLa cells displayed an even higher frequency of severe chromosome segregation defects when Bub1 inhibition was combined with 1\u20134 nM Paclitaxel, comparable to the consequences of combined Mps1 inhibition and Paclitaxel treatment (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). In contrast, Bub1 inhibition only marginally elevated the rate of Paclitaxel-induced chromosome missegregation in RPE1 cells, while combinatorial treatment with Reversine still resulted in a high rate of mild segregation defects. Considering the strong correlation in the data shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>, it is tempting to conclude that chromosome segregation errors constitute the most likely cause for the observed impairment of cell proliferation when Bub1 inhibition is combined with low dose Paclitaxel treatment.

However, the role of the catalytic activity of Bub1 in different species remained a matter of debate. Here, we have characterized two novel small molecule inhibitors of Bub1, BAY-320 and BAY-524, and used these reagents to explore the role of Bub1 catalytic activity in mitotic processes. A systematic comparison of the phenotypic consequences of Bub1 inhibition with those of siRNA-mediated Bub1 depletion leads us to conclude that Bub1 functions primarily as a scaffolding protein. However, we see prominent effects of Bub1 kinase inhibition on chromosome arm cohesion and CPC localization and subtle effects on mitotic progression, including the efficacy of the SAC. Finally, we demonstrate a striking synergy between inhibition of Bub1 activity and Paclitaxel-induced interference with MT dynamics, which manifests itself in a marked increase in chromosome segregation errors and drastically reduced cell proliferation. Our results contribute to clarify the role of Bub1 kinase activity in different mitotic processes. Moreover, they have important implications for potential use of Bub1 inhibitors in therapeutic applications."

While genetic or siRNA-mediated depletion experiments generally suffer from poor temporal resolution, small molecule inhibitors offer a unique opportunity for acute kinase inactivation. The only previously described inhibitor of Bub1 is the bulky ATP analog 2OH-BNPP1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Krenn et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Nyati et al., 2015</a>), but neither the specificity nor the efficacy of this compound in intact cells have been thoroughly characterized. Here, we document that both BAY-320 and BAY-524 effectively inhibit Bub1 kinase activity, in intact cells as well as in vitro. In addition to inhibiting phosphorylation of histone H2A-T120, both compounds cause a persistence of chromosome arm cohesion, validating their efficacy (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kawashima et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, in vitro assays performed on a large panel of kinases showed that inhibition of off-target substrates required at least 20x higher concentrations of BAY-320 than inhibition of Bub1, and for one potentially relevant off-target, the kinase Haspin, we show that intracellular phosphorylation of a major substrate of this kinase is not decreased by inhibitor concentrations that effectively inhibit Bub1. Furthermore, a binding assay performed on a panel of 403 human kinases documents exquisite selectivity of BAY-320 for Bub1. Thus, we are confident that these new Bub1 inhibitors constitute highly effective and specific tools to explore the role of Bub1 kinase activity."

This reinforces the notion that the requirement for Bub1 during chromosome congression and segregation primarily reflects a scaffolding function (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fernius and Hardwick, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Klebig et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Perera and Taylor, 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Rischitor et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Sharp-Baker and Chen, 2001</a>). It is difficult to exclude that a small fraction of total Bub1 kinase activity might be refractory to inhibition and suffice for functionality, but we emphasize that genetic elimination of Bub1 kinase activity is compatible with mouse development, arguing similarly against an essential role of Bub1 kinase activity for mitotic progression (<a href=\"#bib74\">Ricke et al., 2012</a>).

Furthermore, both Sgo2 and Aurora B relocalize to chromosome arms when Bub1 is inhibited. Phosphorylation of Sgo2 by Aurora B promotes Sgo2 interaction with phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (<a href=\"#bib88\">Tanno et al., 2010</a>), and PP2A in turn protects cohesin proteins against phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kitajima et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Riedel et al., 2006</a>). Thus, colocalization of Sgo2 and Aurora B in Bub1-inhibited cells provides a straightforward explanation for the observed persistence of arm cohesion (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kitajima et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Perera et al., 2007</a>). However, alternative mechanisms should not be excluded and it might be rewarding to explore a possible connection between Bub1 kinase and the Sororin-Wapl pathway (<a href=\"#bib72\">Peters and Nishiyama, 2012</a>)."

However, we note that depletion of Wapl also causes persistent cohesion without significantly affecting mitotic progression (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lara-Gonzalez and Taylor, 2012</a>). In contrast to Bub1 inhibition, depletion of Bub1 markedly extended mitotic timing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). One straightforward explanation for this observation is that Bub1 depletion, but not Bub1 inhibition, caused the displacement of CENP-E from KTs, a motor protein required for efficient chromosome congression (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bancroft et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Putkey et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Tanudji et al., 2004</a>). A mechanism centered on CENP-E may also explain the observation that Bub1 depletion exerted a more extensive mitotic delay in the hypertriploid HeLa cells than in diploid RPE1 cells. Considering the important role of Aurora B in the regulation of KT-MT interactions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carmena et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Funabiki and Wynne, 2013</a>), it is remarkable that the observed reduction of centromere/KT-associated CPC caused by Bub1 inhibition did not exert a more profound effect on the fidelity of chromosome segregation. This suggests that approximately half the normal centromere/KT levels of CPC are sufficient to confer functionality. In line with this conclusion, we note that partial impairment of CPC recruitment to centromeres/KTs did not abolish viability or trigger extensive defects in chromosome segregation in budding yeast or chicken DT40 cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Campbell and Desai, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Yue et al., 2008</a>)."

Even when SAC activity was compromised by partial inhibition of the SAC kinase Mps1, Bub1 inhibition triggered only minor weakening of SAC signaling. In striking contrast, Bub1 depletion produced a drastic weakening of the SAC in this sensitized background. For comparison, combined inhibition of Mps1 and either Plk1 or Aurora B resulted in a complete SAC shutdown and immediate mitotic exit, in line with previous results (<a href=\"#bib81\">Saurin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">von Schubert et al., 2015</a>). Collectively these findings confirm that mitotic functions of Bub1 depend primarily on Bub1 protein rather than kinase activity. In future, it will be interesting to explore whether Bub1 activity contributes to purported non-mitotic functions of Bub1 (<a href=\"#bib67\">Nyati et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Yang et al., 2012</a>)."

Several inhibitors of the SAC kinase Mps1 were shown to exert anti-tumor effects in mouse models (<a href=\"#bib15\">Colombo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Kusakabe et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Tannous et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Tardif et al., 2011</a>), but toxicity associated with single agent therapy remains a concern (<a href=\"#bib63\">Martinez et al., 2015</a>). Instead, combination of anti-SAC compounds with MT-targeting agents may constitute a more rewarding strategy (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jema\u00e0 et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Maia et al., 2015</a>). Our present data suggest that it may be attractive to use inhibitors of Bub1 in combinatorial therapy. While BAY-320 and BAY-524 had comparatively little effect on mitotic progression when used as single agents, they showed extensive anti-proliferative activity, accompanied by strong increases in chromosome segregation errors, when combined with therapeutic doses of Paclitaxel. A plausible explanation for this synergy is that Paclitaxel increases KT-MT attachment errors to levels that can no longer be corrected when Aurora B/CPC is partially displaced upon Bub1 inhibition. Interestingly, these synergistic effects were substantially more pronounced in aneuploid HeLa cells than in near-diploid RPE1 cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic window. These findings clearly encourage further exploration of the potential use of Bub1 inhibitors for therapeutic applications."

They demonstrate the specificity of their inhibitors in vitro on a panel of kinases, and in vivo using phosphorylation of Histone H2A threonine 120 as a read out. They show that inhibiting Bub1 causes mild effects on the timing of mitosis and on chromosome congression, but causes persistent cohesion of chromosomes arms concomitant with the chromosome passenger complex remaining on the arms. Although the effects of the Bub1 kinase inhibitors alone only mildly affect mitosis, they have a synergistic effect with low doses of taxol."

Also, the last paragraph that summarises the results can be replaced by a single sentence, e.g. \u2018To address the role of Bub1 kinase activity we characterised two novel inhibitors BAY-320 and BAY-524\u2019. Condensing this text will then allow the authors to provide more detail with regards to what is known about Bub1. For example, in the Results they describe Sgo1, that H2A is a substrate, the link with Haspin etc.; this should all be in the Introduction. Also, what is the prior art regarding Bub1's kinase activity? They say it is controversial but I don't think that is sufficient. Indeed, there is literature that supports the authors\u2019 claims and this should be included. By way of an example, Perera at al deleted Bub1 in MEFs and added back kinase-dead mutants showing that a catalytic mutant or a mutant lacking the entire kinase domain restored BubR1 localisation, SAC function and chromosome alignment but failed to restore Sgo1 localisation. Klebig et al. described similar findings using an RNAi-complementation assay. Similarly, McGuinness et al. showed that in meiosis I, a Bub1 mutant lacking the entire kinase domain restored SAC function. There are other primary papers that should be cited here, e.g. describing work in various model systems. NB, as alluded to above, the authors could highlight the technical challenges with complementation assays as a means of justifying the use of small molecule inhibitors.\u201d"

Specifically, we compared the effects of inhibitor treatment on Thr120 H2A phosphorylation and Aurora B signals at centromeres/KTs over a vast range of inhibitor concentrations. Interestingly, changes in H2A phosphorylation and Aurora B centromere/KT levels correlate nicely at all concentrations below 10 \u03bcM, but no further effect on Aurora B could be observed at concentrations above 10 \u03bcM. This argues that, once Bub1 is maximally inhibited (at 10 \u03bcM), no further impact on Aurora B localization is triggered by our compounds, attesting to specificity."

One reviewer makes the following suggestions:\u201cI would suggest that much of the general introductory material in paragraphs 1 and 2 be condensed. Also, the last paragraph that summarises the results can be replaced by a single sentence, e.g. \u2018To address the role of Bub1 kinase activity we characterised two novel inhibitors BAY-320 and BAY-524\u2019. Condensing this text will then allow the authors to provide more detail with regards to what is known about Bub1. For example, in the Results they describe Sgo1, that H2A is a substrate, the link with Haspin etc.; this should all be in the Introduction. Also, what is the prior art regarding Bub1's kinase activity? They say it is controversial but I don't think that is sufficient. Indeed, there is literature that supports the authors\u2019 claims and this should be included. By way of an example, Perera at al deleted Bub1 in MEFs and added back kinase-dead mutants showing that a catalytic mutant or a mutant lacking the entire kinase domain restored BubR1 localisation, SAC function and chromosome alignment but failed to restore Sgo1 localisation. Klebig et al. described similar findings using an RNAi-complementation assay. Similarly, McGuinness et al. showed that in meiosis I, a Bub1 mutant lacking the entire kinase domain restored SAC function. There are other primary papers that should be cited here, e.g. describing work in various model systems.\u201d</i>"
