In the training, thirsty mice learned that they would receive a reward of water if they licked a water spout after they were briefly touched on one of their whiskers. Then, Yamashita and Petersen measured electrical changes in the brain cells of the trained mice and compared those with measurements from the brain cells of untrained mice. The measurements specifically focused on the brain cells that receive sensory information from the whiskers. These cells are in a region of the brain called the primary sensory cortex, which is known to help mice carry out the task. This brain area in turn sends signals to many downstream areas of the brain."

However, this was only the case for the cells that send signals to a region of the brain that further processes the sensory information (the so-called secondary sensory cortex). Other cells that are intermingled in this region but send signals to the part of the brain that controls movement (the motor cortex) were not affected in this way. Together the data suggest that routing signals from the primary sensory cortex to specific downstream areas might allow animals to learn tasks that depend on responding to sensory cues. More studies are now needed to understand exactly how these signals are generated and whether they contribute to triggering the licking behavior in the mice."

In well-trained mice, putative excitatory neurons in layer 2/3 of S1, on average, have a long-lasting biphasic depolarization after whisker deflection in hit trials, whereas in miss trials the late depolarization is smaller in amplitude (<a href=\"#bib13\">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</a>). However, there is considerable variability across different recordings (<a href=\"#bib13\">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</a>), which could in part relate to distinct types of excitatory projection neurons. Layer 2/3 of S1 barrel cortex has major anatomical ipsilateral cortico-cortical connections to primary whisker motor cortex (M1) and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aronoff et al., 2010</a>). M1-projecting (M1-p) and S2-projecting (S2-p) neurons in layer 2/3 of S1 are likely to be distinct cell-types exhibiting differential patterns of gene expression (<a href=\"#bib16\">Sorensen et al., 2015</a>), distinct intrinsic electrophysiological properties in vivo\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Yamashita et al., 2013</a>), and carrying functionally different signals (<a href=\"#bib14\">Sato and Svoboda, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Yamashita et al., 2013</a>). Retrograde labeling suggests that M1-p and S2-p neurons in S1 are largely non-overlapping types of excitatory neurons (<a href=\"#bib14\">Sato and Svoboda, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Yamashita et al., 2013</a>). Here, we investigate the cellular basis of selective signaling of sensorimotor information in distinct cortico-cortical pathways during the whisker detection task through membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) recordings of M1-p and S2-p neurons, finding that task learning induces a licking-related depolarization specifically in S2-p neurons."

S2-p neurons exhibited a learning-induced depolarization at the late and lick phases of hit trials and during spontaneous unrewarded licking. The grand-averaged, late depolarization in S2-p neurons on hit trials peaked at 261 ms after whisker stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), which was earlier than the mean reaction time (317 ms). The licking-related depolarization in S2-p neurons started shortly (260 \u00b1 46 ms, n = 18) before tongue-spout contact during spontaneous licking (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), which is consistent with the larger depolarization at early and late phases of their responses in hit compared to miss trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Interestingly, S2 has been suggested to be reciprocally connected to a tongue/jaw-related M1/M2 area (also termed anterior lateral motor cortex, ALM) a neocortical region known to be involved in goal-directed licking (<a href=\"#bib12\">Oh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Li et al., 2015</a>). We therefore speculate that the licking-related signals in S2-p neurons in S1 might contribute to exciting neurons in tongue/jaw-related M1/M2 via S2 through reciprocally connected networks of excitatory long-range projection neurons, thus contributing to driving licking motor output (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Consistent with such a hypothesis involving reciprocal excitation between S1 and S2, axons from S2 innervating S1 were found to exhibit strong task-related hit <i>vs</i> miss modulation in a closely-related whisker detection task (<a href=\"#bib19\">Yang et al., 2016</a>)."

Furthermore, rodents are known to have reward-expecting orofacial movements such as sniffing and whisking (<a href=\"#bib5\">Desch\u00eanes et al., 2012</a>). However, transection of the facial motor nerve that controls whisker movements has no impact on task performance or the late phase V<sub>m</sub> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that the late phase V<sub>m</sub> might be generated by internal brain circuits rather than sensory reafference coming from associated whisker movements. In this study we primarily compare neurons projecting to different targets in mice with the same level of task proficiency (i.e. S2-p <i>vs</i> M1-p in \u2018Good performer\u2019 mice, or S2-p <i>vs</i> M1-p in \u2018Naive\u2019 mice), and the differences found comparing these projection neurons can therefore not reflect differences in sensorimotor behavior. In future experiments, it will be important to examine causal roles of S2-p neurons, as well as to investigate the synaptic mechanisms driving the target-specific V<sub>m</sub> dynamics in M1-p and S2-p neurons associated with task learning."

The mice were adapted to head restraint on the recording setup through initial training to freely lick the water spout for receiving water reward (3 \u2013 5 sessions, one session per day). Mice were then taught to associate whisker deflection with water availability through daily training sessions, essentially as described previously (<a href=\"#bib13\">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Sippy et al., 2015</a>). For whisker stimulus, we used a brief (1 ms) magnetic pulse to elicit a vertical deflection of the right C2 whisker transmitted by a small metal particle glued on the whisker. The reward time window was 1\u2009s after the whisker stimulus throughout training. Trials with whisker stimulation (test trials) or those without whisker stimulation (catch trials) were started without preceding cues at random inter-trial intervals ranging from 2 \u2013 10\u2009s. Catch trials were randomly interleaved with test trials, with 40 \u2013 50% probability of all trials. If the mouse licked in the 2\u2009s (or 3\u2009s in some experiments) preceding the time when the trial was supposed to occur, then the trial was aborted. Catch trials were present from the first day of training. After each training session, 1.0 \u2013 1.5\u2009g of wet food pellet was given to the mouse in order to keep its body weight more than 80% of the initial value. Behavioral control and behavioral data collection were carried out with custom-written computer routines using a National Instruments board interfaced through LabView."

Each recording typically lasted ~20\u2009min or less, and we made multiple whole-cell recordings from one animal in most of the experiments. For each recording we routinely monitored the level of task performance by calculating d\u2019 and discarded data with d\u2019 &lt; 1.1 in \u2018Good performer\u2019 mice or those with d\u2019 &gt; 0.9 in \u2018Naive\u2019 mice.

While this is an interesting possibility, alternative possibilities are not considered. What if the learning-related changes in membrane potential dynamics are secondary to changes in behavior? For instance, in addition to expected changes in licking behavior, other orofacial movements and whisking might change during learning. More importantly, sensation associated with these behaviors may change during learning and cause alterations in membrane potential dynamics. If the altered membrane potential dynamics are caused by these secondary changes, the interrelation will be very different. Ideally, these issues should be addressed by additional experiments or measurements. For instance, the authors might record from S2-projecting neurons while paralyzing the whisker pad and removing whisker movement (or whisker pad movement). We understand that this experiment may take more than two months, and you might decide not to do these experiments. If you choose not to perform these experiments, these alternative interpretations must be discussed in the revised manuscript very carefully and in a very visible and balanced way."

Notably, whole cell recording was targeted to neurons retrogradely labeled from their projection target (secondary somatosensory cortex [S2] and primary motor cortex). Furthermore, the authors also compared the data from well-trained (after 7-13 days of training) versus na\u00efve (the first day of training) mice."

The authors discuss that S2-projecting S1 neurons may be responsible in generating licking response in well-trained mice, and the activation of S2-projecting neurons before licking may be due to the reciprocal connection between S2 and the tongue/jaw-related area in M1."

While this is an interesting possibility, alternative possibilities are not considered. What if the learning-related changes in membrane potential dynamics are secondary to changes in behavior? For instance, in addition to expected changes in licking behavior, other orofacial movements and whisking might change during learning. More importantly, sensation associated with these behaviors may change during learning and cause alterations in membrane potential dynamics. If the altered membrane potential dynamics are caused by these secondary changes, the interrelation will be very different. Ideally, these issues should be addressed by additional experiments or measurements. For instance, the authors might record from S2-projecting neurons while paralyzing the whisker pad and removing whisker movement (or whisker pad movement). We understand that this experiment may take more than two months, and you might decide not to do these experiments. If you choose not to perform these experiments, these alternative interpretations must be discussed in the revised manuscript very carefully and in a very visible and balanced way.</i>"

This is hard-won data. Whole cell recordings are rarely applied to behaving mice, much less in a projection-specific manner. The experimental approach is pioneering. However, there are some weaknesses that make the data difficult to interpret. It's not clear to me is there is a change in routing with learning; the mouse might instead employ distinct sensorimotor strategies, which recruit the different projection classes in a different manner. It's nice to see differences in coding across projection classes, but the implications beyond this interesting observation are unclear.</i>"
