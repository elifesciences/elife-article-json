We have found distinct regions of the Arabidopsis genome that are susceptible to DNA (de)methylation in response to hyperosmotic stress. The stress-induced epigenetic changes are associated with conditionally heritable adaptive phenotypic stress responses. However, these stress responses are primarily transmitted to the next generation through the female lineage due to widespread DNA glycosylase activity in the male germline, and extensively reset in the absence of stress. Using the <i>CNI1/ATL31</i> locus as an example, we demonstrate that epigenetically targeted sequences function as distantly-acting control elements of antisense long non-coding RNAs, which in turn regulate targeted gene expression in response to stress. Collectively, our findings reveal that plants use a highly dynamic maternal \u2018short-term stress memory\u2019 with which to respond to adverse external conditions. This transient memory relies on the DNA methylation machinery and associated transcriptional changes to extend the phenotypic plasticity accessible to the immediate offspring."

We have found distinct regions of the Arabidopsis genome that are susceptible to DNA (de)methylation in response to hyperosmotic stress. The stress-induced epigenetic changes are associated with conditionally heritable adaptive phenotypic stress responses. However, these stress responses are primarily transmitted to the next generation through the female lineage due to widespread DNA glycosylase activity in the male germline, and extensively reset in the absence of stress. Using the <i>CNI1/ATL31</i> locus as an example, we demonstrate that epigenetically targeted sequences function as distantly-acting control elements of antisense long non-coding RNAs, which in turn regulate targeted gene expression in response to stress. Collectively, our findings reveal that plants use a highly dynamic maternal \u2018short-term stress memory\u2019 with which to respond to adverse external conditions. This transient memory relies on the DNA methylation machinery and associated transcriptional changes to extend the phenotypic plasticity accessible to the immediate offspring."

Because plants are sessile organisms, it has been suggested that they can efficiently integrate environmental signals into a \u2018stress memory\u2019 that is transmitted to the immediate progeny. This newly acquired information could allow populations to respond efficiently to repeated exposure to the same stress, a phenomenon known as 'priming' or 'acclimation' (<a href=\"#bib19\">Crisp et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Conrath et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Sani et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Slaughter et al., 2012</a>). It has recently been proposed that epigenetic marks could be induced depending on the consistency of the cues that individuals perceive directly from the environment (<a href=\"#bib91\">Uller et al., 2015</a>). Yet it remains unclear how often this actually occurs in nature, and whether such adaptive responses can be transmitted over multiple non-stressed generations, a phenomenon termed \u201ctransgenerational stress memory\u201d (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hauser et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Paszkowski and Grossniklaus, 2011</a>)."

Genome-wide studies in plants have shown that environmental stress dynamically modifies the chromatin landscape, creating novel patterns of gene expression, and thereby affecting short-term adaptation to stress (<a href=\"#bib78\">Sani et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, heritable traits resulting from environmental stress have been associated with DNA methylation changes in promoter regions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bilichak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Le et al., 2014</a>), gene-coding regions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bilichak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Jiang et al., 2014</a>), transgenes (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lang-Mladek et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Molinier et al., 2006</a>) and transposable elements (TEs) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Boyko et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Le et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Secco et al., 2015</a>)."

For instance, pathogen attack in Arabidopsis can cause changes in DNA methylation primarily at TEs and repeats located proximal to genes associated with transcriptional defense responses (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dowen et al., 2012</a>), while temperature stress can trigger specific TE activation that, when inserted near genes, can confer stress-mediated transcriptional responses (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cavrak et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Naito et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Yasuda et al., 2013</a>). Similarly in rice, phosphate starvation alters methylation at TEs near environmentally induced genes (<a href=\"#bib82\">Secco et al., 2015</a>). These findings, which are reminiscent of the domestication of viral DNA for human immunity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chuong et al., 2016</a>), support the view that TEs play pivotal roles in environmental stress-sensing (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kalendar et al., 2000</a>). The precise mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive. It is possible that the specific repetitive sequences present in transposons can generate and/or be recognised by stress-induced small non-coding RNAs that direct <i>de novo</i> DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</a>). Alternatively, DNA methylation could be affected by stress independently of small RNAs through the RDR6-RdDM pathway (<a href=\"#bib65\">Nuthikattu et al., 2013</a>) or be targeted and demethylated by DNA glycosylases (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kim and Zilberman, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Zhang and Zhu, 2012</a>), thereby imparting dynamic transcriptional changes at neighbouring genes. This is supported by observations of mutants defective for genes of these epigenetic pathways, and which have impaired biotic and abiotic stress responses (<a href=\"#bib12\">Boyko et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ito et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Le et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Luna and Ton, 2012</a>)."

Some of these changes are transmitted to the offspring, where they affect the transcriptional regulation of a small group of genes associated with enhanced tolerance to environmental stress. In the absence of a renewed stress stimulus, the acquired epigenetic and phenotypic changes are gradually reset in subsequent generations. Further, newly acquired stress tolerance and associated <i>de novo</i> DNA methylation marks are preferentially transmitted through the female germline. Epigenetic inheritance relies on DNA methylation changes at sequences that function as distantly acting control elements of key stress-response regulators, including antisense long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Collectively, our data provide a new mechanistic model for the establishment and transient inheritance of plant stress adaptation."

In contrast to progeny of stressed wild-type plants, immediate progeny of stressed <i>nrpd1a</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Herr et al., 2005),</a><i>cmt3 (</i><a href=\"#bib16\">Chan <i>et al., 2006)</i></a> and <i>ros1/dml2/dml3 (rdd)</i> (<a href=\"#bib70\">Penterman et al., 2007</a>) plants did not show enhanced survival under hyperosmotic stress conditions (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). These data imply that transgenerational adaptation to hyperosmotic stress relies in part on the DNA methylation machinery, although these phenotypic data do not reveal how extensive the epigenetic changes are."

To ensure statistically robust results, we excluded inter-individual epigenetic variation that can arise over the course of several generations (<a href=\"#bib7\">Becker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Schmitz et al., 2011</a>) by collecting duplicate samples of leaf tissue from 10 plants each from the G1, G3 and G5 generations for each treatment (control, 25\u2009mM-, and 75\u2009mM-NaCl) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We sought to compare DNA methylation patterns for the different treatments in non-stressed P1 and P2 progeny derived from control or salt-stressed P0 parents (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Individual cytosines with a significantly altered methylation frequency, termed differentially methylated positions (DMPs), were first identified by pairwise comparisons between two samples. Because the three stressed generations had been grown and treated at different time points, we only compared samples belonging to the same treatment group, thus excluding methylation changes that were due to stochastic fluctuations in growth conditions. Single-site polymorphisms between any two samples were rare, with on average 6,866 DMPs (40% CG, 15% CHG and 45% CHH) detected per generation in all pairwise comparisons (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Principal component analysis (PCA) and complete linkage clustering of methylation frequencies grouped all stress-treated samples (P0), separating them from control, P1, and P2 samples (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). This indicated that hyperosmotic stress had a small but noticeable effect on single methylated cytosines, and that this effect was largely transient. Overall we observed three times more methylation gains than losses in salt-treated P0 plants compared to the control (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Because we found considerably fewer DMPs than recently reported for multi-generational hyperosmotic stress treatments (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jiang et al., 2014</a>), we re-analysed the published data. We found that only a small fraction of the DNA methylation changes reported by <a href=\"#bib39\">Jiang et al. (2014)</a> were consistently induced by hyperosmotic stress (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

                                "text": "The properties of DMPs are distinct from those of differentially methylated regions (DMRs, i.e., contiguous stretches of methylation change), as DMPs mostly occur at sparsely distributed CG sites within gene bodies, whereas DMRs tend to occur in densely methylated areas of mixed methylation context (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hagmann et al., 2015</a>). To identify stress-induced DMRs, we used a statistically robust Hidden Markov Model-based algorithm that supports the confident detection of differential methylation also in CHG and CHH contexts (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hagmann et al., 2015</a>). We identified on average 24,700 methylated regions (MRs) per sample with a median length of 272 bp (mean: 856 bp). To identify generation-specific and treatment-dependent DMRs, we considered samples of the same generation (G1, G3 or G5, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and treatment regime (control or salt-treated) as replicates (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>). For all three generations, DMRs mapped mainly to TEs and intergenic regions, and were three- to seven-fold over-represented in 2-kb regions upstream of transcription start sites compared with overall methylation in MRs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). No significant differences were found in the average methylation frequencies at MRs in control and stressed samples (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), or for CG methylation frequencies at DMRs in control and stress-treated samples (P &gt; 0.05 in all generations, unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

For G1, the cluster comprising the non-stressed samples did not have any clear substructure. By contrast, for G3 and G5, the P1-descendants of salt-treated P0 plants formed a clear sub-group distinct from the control and P2 plants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These data concur with the adaptive responses we observed specifically in the P1, but not in the P2 progeny of G3 and G5 salt-treated plants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). P2-descendants showed methylation patterns similar to control plants, which correlated with the observed lack of high salinity tolerance. We also analysed published DNA methylation data derived from individual plants subjected to hyperosmotic stress (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jiang et al., 2014</a>), focussing on DMRs, and considering individual samples as replicates. We confirmed our finding that the methylation changes in CHG and CHH correlated well with stress treatment, whereas changes in CG methylation did not, indicating that CG methylation patterns occur stochastically in treated and non-treated samples (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Thus, hyperosmotic stress directs DNA methylation changes primarily at non-CG sites located in intergenic TE-related sequences, and these epigenetic modifications are associated with an acquired transient adaptation to stress."

To determine the significance of these hyperosmotic-stress DMRs (HS-DMRs), we asked whether they were also responsive to other abiotic stresses, such as cold treatment. Comparing our data with a small set of DMRs in cold-stressed Arabidopsis seedlings (<a href=\"#bib83\">Seymour et al., 2014</a>), we did not detect any overlap between the two datasets. By contrast, 49% of HS-DMRs in stressed plants (P0) overlapped with or were in close proximity (&lt;500 bp) to DMRs that had been reported to arise spontaneously in mutation accumulation (MA) lines that had been grown over 30 generations under controlled conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Becker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hagmann et al., 2015</a>). These spontaneous MA-DMRs are often found in more than one individual, pointing to specific regions of the genome being particularly susceptible to epigenetic reprogramming. We compared pools of ten plants to identify HS-DMRs, while individual plants had been compared to define MA-DMRs. That there is nevertheless substantial overlap indicates that stress-triggered epigenetic reprogramming of specific genomic regions is not entirely random."

Overlapping and non-overlapping DMRs behaved similarly for G3 and G5 (but not G1), with stressed samples clustering in one group and control and untreated progeny in another. This indicated that overlapping and non-overlapping DMRs carried a similar hyperosmotic stress signature (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), but the two DMR classes differed in their association with adjacent annotated genes (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In particular, HS-DMRs that did not overlap with spontaneous MA-DMRs were enriched near genes with functions related to metabolic responses and ion transport (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). These data thus suggest that exposure to hyperosmotic stress targets discrete, epigenetically labile regions of the genome."

Most HS-DMRs (81%) in G3 and G5 were hypermethylated in the hyperosmotic-treated P0 samples, whereas G1 plants had similar number of hyper- and hypo-methylated DMRs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Further, in progenies of stress-treated plants, the CHG and CHH methylation changes were gradually lost and reverted to the control states, as seen in the P1 and P2 progeny grown in the absence of stress (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Hyper- and hypo-methylated HS-DMRs mapped to different genomic regions, with methylation gain after hyperosmotic stress frequently found within or proximal to TEs, but methylation loss occurring more frequently near genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Hyper-methylated HS-DMRs were significantly enriched near <i>Helitrons</i> (unpaired Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test; **p&lt;0.01) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), a TE family known to be targeted by RdDM (<a href=\"#bib65\">Nuthikattu et al., 2013</a>), and near genes involved in RNA-directed DNA polymerase and reverse transcription activities (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In contrast, hypo-methylated DMRs were found proximal to <i>Copia, HAT</i>, and <i>Line L1</i> TEs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). These transposon families are targeted by DNA demethylases and are associated with gene expression response to environmental stress (<a href=\"#bib51\">Le et al., 2014</a>). By contract, an increase in non-CG hyper-methylation is indicative of RdDM activity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</a>). To test whether RdDM was responsible for some of the HS-DMRs, we exposed <i>drm1/drm2</i> double mutants to hyperosmotic stress over two consecutive generations. In contrast to wild-type, <i>drm1/drm2</i> plants did not show hyper-methylation in non-CG contexts (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, when we analysed public datasets for known siRNA loci (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fahlgren et al., 2010</a>), we could not detect a correlation between methylation status and the presence of active siRNA production (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

We found that enhanced tolerance to hyperosmotic stress conditions was primarily conferred through the female germline (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). As the epigenetic reprogramming of male gametes is mediated to a large extent by DEMETER (DME) DNA glycosylase activity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Calarco et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ibarra et al., 2012</a>), we investigated whether hyperosmotic priming could be passed on through the male germline if DME-dependent reprogramming was disrupted. We stressed <i>dme</i>-6 plants for two generations and tested the offspring for tolerance to hyperosmotic stress. The progeny of <i>dme</i>-6 stressed plants were even more tolerant to hyperosmotic stress (Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test, p&lt;0.001) than that of stressed control plants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), thus implicating DME\u2019s involvement in resetting stress-directed methylation marks in the male germline. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed reciprocal crosses between unstressed wild-type and stressed heterozygous <i>dme</i>-6 plants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The differential responses observed confirmed that DME diminishes the paternal transmission of hyperosmotic priming responses."

Unlike in somatic tissue, hyperosmotic stress induced very few methylation changes in SC and VN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) such that only three DMRs became hypomethylated upon hyperosmotic treatment. This strikingly contrasted with the13,776 DMRs that distinguished SCs from VNs (SV-DMRs) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Most of the SV-DMRs predominantly localized next to TEs and were particularly enriched in adjacent regions of coding sequences (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Significantly, over three quarters of the HS-DMRs (76%) overlapped with SV-DMRs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and half of them with MA-DMRs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Further, when compared with somatic tissues, CHG methylation in SC was elevated in pericentromeric regions, while methylation in VN was depleted in all sequence contexts and reduced to the central centromeric region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Because siRNAs produced in the vegetative nuclei can silence transposons in sperm cells in a DME-dependent process (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ibarra et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Martinez et al., 2016</a>), we assessed the methylation state of HS-DMRs in <i>dme</i> mutants. Most HS-DMRs were hyper-methylated in <i>dme</i>-6 sperm cells but hypo-methylated in <i>dme-</i>6 vegetative nuclei (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplemental 2</a>). However, we observed similar methylation differences at non-DMR coordinates (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplemental 2</a>), indicating that HS-DMRs are only a subset of loci that are under the control of DME."

The <i>CNI1</i> HS-DMR, which also overlapped a TE, had reduced DNA methylation in the P1 progeny of stressed plants, and remained hypomethylated in P2 progeny. Hyperosmotic stress strongly reduced <i>CNI1</i> expression in progeny of untreated plants, and to a lesser extent in progeny of plants exposed to hyperosmotic stress (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We also analysed four additional genes with adjacent HS-DMR and found similar modes of epigenetic regulation and inheritance (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Independent of growth condition or priming, the expression of <i>MYB20, CNI1</i> and four other genes with associated HS-DMRs was altered in <i>rdd</i> demethylation mutants, and the transcriptional stress response in P1 progeny of stressed plants was impaired in RdDM mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We then assessed the transcriptional response of genes encoding components of the DNA methylation and demethylation pathways and found that many of them were sensitive to hyperosmotic salt treatment (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

We hypothesised that this HS-DMR may act as a long-distance regulatory element. We therefore analysed the effects of two independent mutant alleles, in which T-DNAs were inserted between the <i>CNI1</i> transcription unit and the downstream HS-DMR, possibly impeding communication between the HS-DMR and the <i>CNI1</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). As expected, <i>CNI1</i> sense transcription in both insertion alleles was misregulated in response to stress (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). To demonstrate the functional relevance of the sequence targeted epigenetically after hyperosmotic-stress, we generated a deletion line (<i>\u0394</i>cni1-<i>DMR</i>) using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing (<a href=\"#bib41\">Jinek et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Deletion of the HS-DMR sequence reduced downregulation of sense <i>CNI1</i> transcripts in response to hyperosmotic stress (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), indicating that this HS-DMR acts as a distant regulatory element. Finally, to demonstrate directly that the methylation status of this element determines its activity, we introduced an inverted repeat (IR) hairpin (<a href=\"#bib60\">Matzke et al., 2002</a>) that directs DNA methylation to the <i>CNI1</i> HS-DMR by RdDM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). McrBC assays and bisulfite sequencing confirmed that methylation in IR hairpin transgenic lines remained even under hyperosmotic stress (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Levels of <i>CNI1</i> sense transcript in response to stress were no longer reduced in these plants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), thus strengthening the argument that the <i>CNI1</i> HS-DMR acts as an epigenetically sensitive regulatory element."

By contrast, hyperosmotic stress reduced expression of this lncRNA in progeny of plants exposed to hyperosmotic stress (<i>p</i>-value 0.015; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). That this was linked to differential methylation was indicated by the hyperosmotic responsiveness of <i>CNI1-AS1</i> being impaired in progeny of <i>rdd</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). In the two insertion alleles and in the deletion line, the stress-mediated transcriptional response was similarly altered (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). These data support a model in which the HS-DMR downstream of <i>CNI1</i> acts as an epigenetic sensor that controls <i>CNI1</i> expression by modulating the expression of an antisense lncRNA. Our finding that lncRNA expression was insensitive to hyperosmotic stress in IR hairpin lines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) adds further weight to this model."

Unlike animals, plants present a fascinating model to examine this problem because their sessile nature makes it likely that parent and offspring will be exposed to similarly stressful conditions. Here, we have used a systematic approach to assess transgenerational stress adaptation in Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Our main conclusion is that intergenerational priming responses to hyperosmotic stress are triggered by recurrent exposure to stimuli, but that this response is rapidly lost in the absence of stress. Whether stress memory is less transient in perennial plants, which are rooted in place over consecutive years, needs to be determined."

In mammals such adaptation is usually associated with changes in DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib74\">Radford et al., 2014</a>). In plants, environmentally-directed heritable traits have also been proposed to be associated with whole-scale changes in global DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Boyko et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dowen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Jiang et al., 2014</a>). Bycontrast, using our highly controlled and replicated syste, and a strict method for detecting methylated regions, we found no clear evidence for such indiscriminate changes. Instead, we found that hyperosmotic stress directs DNA methylation changes primarily to discrete genome regions that are rich in TE-related sequences (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). The dynamic DNA methylation changes are of functional consequence because the adaptive response is impaired in mutants defective in DNA methylation pathways (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), which are also known to regulate TE activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kim and Zilberman, 2014</a>). Mutants defective in DNA methylation and demethylation pathways displayed similar adaptive stress memory abilities, thus indicating that adaptive memory is controlled by complex processes that may not strictly rely on DNA methylation changes alone (<a href=\"#bib19\">Crisp et al., 2016</a>)."

This finding confirms that distinct regions of the plant epigenome are particularly labile, and it suggests that such acquired epimutations could modulate the ability of plants to respond to stress. Importantly, in our system, enhanced stress responses were only passed on after two consecutive generations of stress exposure, but not when plants were exposed to hyperosmotic stress for only one episode, which may be the reason why previous studies often failed to find clear evidence for inheritance of stress-induced epigenetic changes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Eichten and Springer, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Secco et al., 2015</a>). One explanation for repeated stress exposure being required for induction of transiently heritable stress resistance may reside in the importance of poised epigenetic states for environmental priming (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jaskiewicz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Sani et al., 2013</a>), which in turn may facilitate the establishment of new epigenetic marks at discrete genomic regions that are sensitive to stress. This view is supported by the substantial overlap (&gt;30%) between HS-DMRs established in recurrently stressed generations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and dynamic chromatin occupancy directed by hyperosmosis (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Intriguingly, recurrent exposure to hyperosmotic stress did not significantly increase the number of newly acquired epimutations, suggesting that the extent of epigenetic plasticity elicited by the environment is limited to a few key genomic regions that may be under purifying selection (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</a>). It is likely that certain genomic regions are epigenetically targeted, depending on the type of stress because the DNA methylation changes induced by hyperosmotic stress did not overlap with methylation changes reported for other abiotic stresses (<a href=\"#bib83\">Seymour et al., 2014</a>). A direct comparison of the latter study to this study is however difficult to make due to inconsistencies in experimental methodology, as <a href=\"#bib83\">Seymour and colleagues (2014)</a> did not investigate methylation changes in subsequent generations grown in the absence of stress."

Our analyses revealed that hyperosmotic priming responses were transmitted primarily through the maternal germline (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We attribute this difference to differences in the meiotic transmission of newly acquired DNA methylation marks. In support of this hypothesis, most of the stress-associated methylation changes in leaves were largely absent in mature male gametes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), indicating that environmentally directed epigenetic marks are more efficiently reset in male rather\u00a0than in female gametes. Indeed, not only do male gametes undergo an active reprogramming of DNA methylation at transposon sequences by the DNA glycosylase DME (<a href=\"#bib9\">Borges et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ibarra et al., 2012</a>), but also at stress-dependent DNA methylation sites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Moreover, the enhanced tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in progeny of stressed <i>dme</i>-6 plants implicates DNA demethylation both in the active reprogramming of TEs and in the resetting of environmentally-directed epigenetic changes in male gametes. The male transmission of stress-associated adaptive responses is under the strict control of DME (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Although the precise mechanism of DME in resetting HS-DMRs is unknown, it may be linked to the movement of RNA to sperm cells from the surrounding vegetative cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Martinez et al., 2016</a>). Why male and female gametes should differ in their ability to reset newly acquired epigenetic marks remains an enigma. One explanation is that female gametes reside on the mother plant where they are eventually fertilised by sperm from pollen that may have travelled a great distance from its male progenitor to produce seed. Given that seed dispersal usually occurs at a short distance from the mother, a solely maternal transmission of the newly acquired epigenetic marks would be an efficient way of retaining only the most relevant parental stress-associated adaptive responses in the progeny."

Previous studies have focused on these pathways because they mediate global stress responses (<a href=\"#bib103\">Zhu, 2009</a>). We now provide compelling evidence that stress can specifically alter methylation at the adjacent sequences of several key stress-response regulators (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>), a process that is mediated by the RdDM and DNA demethylation pathways (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Targeted studies have revealed that some TEs proximal to upstream regions and sensitive to methylation changes directed by hyperosmotic stress have regulatory roles (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baek et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Xu et al., 2015</a>) and are associated with quantitative traits and adaptive behaviour (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baxter et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Busoms et al., 2015</a>). Notably, both DNA methylation and demethylation activities are also tightly regulated by the action of adjacent upstream TEs that act as an epigenetic sensors (<a href=\"#bib52\">Lei et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Williams et al., 2015</a>). The epigenetic regulation of HS-DMRs is not always associated with upstream regulatory sequences and sense transcription; instead we found that they are preferentially associated with the transcription of antisense lncRNAs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Although the functions of these HS-DMR-associated non-coding transcripts are largely unknown, antisense lncRNAs have been implicated in directing chromatin changes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ariel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Heo and Sung, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Swiezewski et al., 2009</a>), and thereby in influencing transcription, splicing and transcript stability (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bardou et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Borsani et al., 2005</a>). In\u00a0this\u00a0study,antisense lncRNAs were shown to be regulated by epigenetically labile control elements sensitive to stress (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

Because conditions in many natural environments are highly stochastic, an adaptive bet-hedging strategy (<a href=\"#bib86\">Simons, 2011</a>) that is mediated by increased epigenetic variation could be advantageous. Under our controlled stress conditions, the contribution of adaptive epigenetic variation shows parental effects (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), which may be favoured over bet-hedging in relatively stable environments (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kuijper and Johnstone, 2016</a>).

Regions that showed statistically significant methylation differences between at least two sets of strains were identified as DMRs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hagmann et al., 2015</a>). In brief, segmentations across the genomes of every sample served to set breakpoints of start and end coordinates of all predicted MRs. Each combination of coordinates in this set defined a segment to perform the test for differential methylation in all pairwise comparisons of the strains, if at least one strain was in a high methylation state throughout this whole segment (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hagmann et al., 2015</a>). Per pairwise comparison, between 30,000 and 50,000 segments were tested (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hagmann et al., 2015</a>). For tests within generations, we grouped P0 control, P1 control and P2 control samples as 'non-stressed'; P0 salt-treated samples as 'stressed'; P1 samples derived from salt-treated P0 plants as 'stressed-P1'; and P2 samples derived from salt-treated P0 plants as 'stressed-P2'. Tests for DMRs were then carried out between these four groups. In addition we separately tested without the respective remaining groups for 'non-stressed' vs. 'stressed', 'stressed' vs. 'stressed P1', 'stressed' vs. 'stressed P2', and 'stressed P1' vs 'stressed P2'.

The role of epigenetic information in mediating such forms of 'soft inheritance' is of great general interest, though relatively few clear examples have been discovered so far in plants. Indeed, although several recent reports concluded that there is epigenome-mediated transgenerational memory of stress in plants, many of these studies were not rigorous in terms of design or analysis, or focused on effects at complex transgenic loci, the applicability of which to endogenous genes is unclear. By contrast, this study is carefully designed and analyzed. Detailed genetic experiments at the CNI locus support take home messages from the whole genome experiments. Overall, this is an impressive paper but certain key aspects need further clarification and/or experiments."

The implication is that the action of DME in the VN is responsible for erasing acquired methylation marks in wild type plants. Ideally this would be supported by data showing increased methylation at HS-DMR regions in the sperm cells of stressed <i>dme</i> plants. In the absence of these data the authors should compare the HS-DMRs with <i>dme</i> DMRs defined by Ibarra et al. Is there significant overlap?"

This could potentially be explained by reduced ROS1 activity in RdDM mutants, but ROS1 expression is not reduced in <i>cmt3</i>.

This section was quite hard to follow and to extract the 'take home message'. Statements like 'small but noticeable effect' and 'discovered our DMR regions were present.\u2026 but they were below our statistical cut-off' do not give the reader confidence. Surely, the point of a cut-off is that regions below that should not be considered? Is it worth reporting such effects, which seem more or less anecdotal? The complexity of this section is compounded by the fact that stochastic methylation change is observed between generations, as reported by the Weigel and Ecker labs. However, the authors do a good job of disentangling these effects from those caused by the stress. Gain of non-CG methylation at DMRs is the strongest effect caused by the salt stress, so that should be stated more clearly and earlier. The DMP analysis does not seem that relevant, as there is very little evidence that single methylation polymorphisms are biologically meaningful, and thus could be deleted from the manuscript."

Surely, the point of a cut-off is that regions below that should not be considered? Is it worth reporting such effects, which seem more or less anecdotal? The complexity of this section is compounded by the fact that stochastic methylation change is observed between generations, as reported by the Weigel and Ecker labs. However, the authors do a good job of disentangling these effects from those caused by the stress.
