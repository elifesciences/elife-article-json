Previous studies identified <i>ectodysplasin (EDA)</i> gene as the major locus controlling recurrent plate loss in freshwater fish, though the causative DNA alterations were not known. Here we show that freshwater <i>EDA</i> alleles have <i>cis</i>-acting regulatory changes that reduce expression in developing plates and spines. An identical T-&gt;G base pair change is found in <i>EDA</i> enhancers of divergent low-plated fish. Recreation of the T-&gt;G change in a marine enhancer strongly reduces expression in posterior armor plates. Bead implantation and cell culture experiments show that Wnt signaling strongly activates the marine <i>EDA</i> enhancer, and the freshwater T-&gt;G change reduces Wnt responsiveness. Thus parallel evolution of low-plated sticklebacks has occurred through a shared DNA regulatory change, which reduces the sensitivity of an <i>EDA</i> enhancer to Wnt signaling, and alters expression in developing armor plates while preserving expression in other tissues."
