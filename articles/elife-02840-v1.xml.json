However, few new antibiotics have been developed over the past two decades (<a href=\"#bib1\">Chief Medical Officer\u2019s report, 2011</a>). The situation is further complicated by the fact that many current antibiotics have severe side effects, particularly if they are used for a long time. There is, therefore, an urgent need for novel drugs. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Richard Ebright and colleagues from Rutgers University, the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, and Naicons Srl\u2014including Yu Zhang, David Degen, and Mary Ho as joint first authors\u2014use a combination of genetic, biochemical and structural approaches to characterise how a recently discovered compound, with very promising properties, works (<a href=\"#bib9\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>)."

In effect, these drugs \u2018throw a spanner in the works\u2019 of the bacterial cell. One set of prime targets for antibiotics are enzymes called multisubunit RNA polymerases (RNAPs), which transcribe the cellular genomes of all life on Earth (<a href=\"#bib7\">Werner and Grohmann, 2011</a>)."

Mutations that stop antibiotics inhibiting bacterial RNAP emerge randomly regardless of the environment the bacteria grow in. In most cases these changes will also make the bacterium less fit. Therefore, if the bacteria are not exposed to antibiotics, the number of resistant bacteria remains low compared to the number that are sensitive to the antibiotic (<a href=\"#bib3\">Comas et al., 2012</a>). However, if antibiotics are then targeted at these bacteria, the selective pressure of the drug treatment may increase the proportion of drug-resistant mutants in the overall population, and thus a drug resistant strain of bacteria will emerge over time. In addition, the initial loss of fitness associated with the drug-resistant mutations is often compensated for by additional mutations, and so a new and more dangerous pathogen can evolve (<a href=\"#bib3\">Comas et al., 2012</a>)."

Rif works in a similar way: as this antibiotic\u2019s binding site is close to, but offset from GE\u2019s, Rif allows the formation of di-and tri-nucleotides but prevents the synthesis of longer RNA chains. GE also interferes with the binding of a magnesium ion in the RNAP active site that is critical for enzyme catalysis."

GE and Rif (as well as several other antibiotics) target the same region of the enzyme: the RNAP catalytic centre (highlighted with a red dashed circle). Zhang et al. found that the binding sites of GE and Rif are distinct, yet close to each other; this explains why the two drugs inhibit RNAP catalysis in subtly different ways. In both cases the antibiotic does not interfere with the first steps of transcription initiation, and the RNAP can still load a DNA template (teal). Instead, each antibiotic interferes with the next step: the bonding together of nucleotides to form an RNA chain. A saturation mutagenesis of a volume within 30 \u00c5 of the active site identified just 6 mutations that could give rise to GE antibiotic resistance, compared with 71 that produce Rif-resistance. (<b>B</b>) The RNAP active site. The GE (blue stick diagram) target site (green) identified by Zhang et al. is much smaller than Rif\u2019s (yellow stick diagram) target site (red; image taken from Figure 6 of <a href=\"#bib9\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>)."

This generates all the possible mutations at a specific site, in this case within 30 \u00c5 of the catalytic centre of <i>E. coli</i> RNAP. The analysis revealed a very small target-based resistance spectrum, as only a very few mutations could produce RNAPs that are both resistant to GE and still catalytically active. The GE target site is also roughly 10-fold smaller than that of Rif and is therefore superior as it presents fewer possible sites of mutation."

As the \u2018icing on the cake\u2019 of their work, Ebright and colleagues joined together GE and Rif to generate a novel two-part (bipartite) compound, Rifa-GE. While Rifa-GE is as potent as GE or Rif, it also effectively inhibits RNAP variants that are resistant to either."
