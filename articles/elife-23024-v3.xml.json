A prerequisite for faithful signal transmission is the positioning and clustering of AMPARs at postsynaptic sites. The mechanisms underlying this positioning have largely been ascribed to the receptor cytoplasmic C-termini and to AMPAR-associated auxiliary subunits, both interacting with the postsynaptic scaffold. Here, using mouse organotypic hippocampal slices, we show that the extracellular AMPAR N-terminal domain (NTD), which projects midway into the synaptic cleft, plays a fundamental role in this process. This highly sequence-diverse domain mediates synaptic anchoring in a subunit-selective manner.

Previous research has shown that in order to bind glutamate effectively, these receptors need to be trapped and anchored at the correct location at the synapse. This trapping mechanism controls the number of receptors present, which strengthens the synapse, and ultimately mediates learning and memory. However, it is still not clear how AMPA receptor trapping is achieved."

The experiments show that an external segment of the AMPA receptor called the N-terminal domain (or NTD for short) is a key element for receptor anchoring at the postsynapse. The AMPA receptor is made out of four different subunits; when the NTD portion was removed from one specific subunit, fewer receptors were anchored correctly at the postsynapse. When the NTD was removed from another subunit, it completely prevented the synapse from learning. Therefore, the NTD brings about subunit-selective anchoring of the AMPA receptor, which affects the ability of the synapse to transmit signals."

Their activation drives propagation of presynaptic impulses through depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane (<a href=\"#bib71\">Traynelis et al., 2010</a>). As AMPARs have low apparent glutamate affinity, and rapidly diffuse in the plane of the membrane, they require trapping at synaptic sites in order to effectively contribute to\u00a0signal transmission (<a href=\"#bib12\">Choquet and Triller, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Heine et al., 2008</a>). Synapse strengthening, as occurs during learning, results from the recruitment of additional AMPARs and their enrichment at synapses (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chater and Goda, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kessels and Malinow, 2009</a>).

To study the role of this domain at synapses we expressed AMPAR subunits in organotypic hippocampal slices using single-cell electroporation of plasmid DNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Exogenously expressed AMPARs mostly form homomers (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shi et al., 2001</a>), and when unedited at the Q/R site give rise to a rectifying current/voltage (I/V) relationship, resulting from intracellular polyamine block (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bowie and Mayer, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kamboj et al., 1995</a>). Homomeric GluA1, and GluA2 unedited at the Q/R RNA editing site (denoted GluA2Q), are selectively blocked at positive membrane potentials, permitting electrophysiological detection of exogenous AMPARs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hayashi et al., 2000</a>). Untransfected neurons exhibit a linear I/V response resulting from endogenous heteromers containing the edited GluA2 subunit (GluA2R), and therefore the ratio of currents at positive and negative membrane potentials, the rectification index (RI), can be used to assay the synaptic receptor content. We have characterized synaptic responses from untransfected and transfected cells using two parameters: excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitude, which is directly proportional to the number of synaptic receptors, and the RI, which provides a readout of the proportion of exogenous to endogenous receptors contributing to the response."

To compare GluA2 wild-type (WT) to a mutant lacking the NTD, we first tested the surface trafficking capacity of GluA2 constructs bearing an NTD deletion, a modification that does not impair AMPAR function (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pasternack et al., 2002</a>). Deletion of amino acids 1\u2013377 of the mature polypeptide resulted in optimal surface expression in HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B2</a>) and was used throughout this study (designated GluA2Q \u0394NTD). When expressed in CA1 pyramidal neurons, this GluA2Q \u0394NTD construct produced inwardly rectifying responses in somatic outside-out patches, matching the responses from neurons expressing full-length GluA2Q (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). As the functional properties of neuronal AMPARs and their expression at synapses are modulated by auxiliary subunits, most prominently by TARPs, we determined whether exogenous GluA2 was still TARP-associated. A signature of TARP action is an increased efficacy of the partial agonist kainic acid (KA) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Tomita et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Turetsky et al., 2005</a>), and the ratio of kainate and glutamate response amplitudes (KA/Glu ratio) is a measure of AMPAR/TARP stoichiometry (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shi et al., 2009</a>). The KA/Glu ratio suggests full TARP occupancy for both GluA2Q and GluA2Q \u0394NTD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D1</a>), implying that TARPs are not limiting in our system and NTD deletion does not affect TARP association. Amplitudes of glutamate-evoked currents from GluA2Q and GluA2Q \u0394NTD-expressing somatic patches were similar, further confirming that expression levels are comparable, and were approximately double that of untransfected neurons\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D2</a>), which can be explained by the greater single channel conductance of (unedited) GluA2Q homomers than native receptors (see below; <a href=\"#bib68\">Swanson et al., 1997</a>)."

However, while EPSC amplitudes were elevated in neurons expressing GluA2Q relative to paired untransfected cells (166 \u00b1 13%), EPSCs were significantly reduced in GluA2Q \u0394NTD neurons (58 \u00b1 5%; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B1\u20132</a> versus <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C1\u20132</a>).

The synaptic AMPAR single-channel conductance was significantly increased in both groups of transfected cells, as expected from the expression of Q/R-unedited receptors (<a href=\"#bib68\">Swanson et al., 1997</a>). However, there was no difference between GluA2Q and GluA2Q \u0394NTD that could explain the substantial drop in synaptic AMPAR current amplitudes in GluA2Q \u0394NTD-expressing neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Based on this accumulated evidence, a change in the number of receptors at the synapse most feasibly explains the observed effect on EPSC amplitude, whereby significantly less GluA2Q \u0394NTD receptors are present at the synapse than GluA2Q. Since AMPARs have a relatively low affinity for L-glutamate (e.g.\u00a0<a href=\"#bib32\">Jonas, 2000</a>), the NTD may stabilize and cluster the receptor in proximity to presynaptic release sites to enable optimal receptor activation."

In sharp contrast, recovery of SEP-GluA2 \u0394NTD was rapid (\u03c4<sub>rec</sub>= 65 s) and the immobile fraction at 600 s was reduced to just 7%. Thus, NTD-deleted receptors are poorly confined in spines when compared to full-length GluA2Q. Interestingly, this difference was specific to spine fluorescence: in extra-synaptic (dendritic) regions, SEP-GluA2 exhibited rapid (\u03c4<sub>rec</sub> = 98 s) and almost complete recovery (immobile fraction\u00a0=\u00a018%), which was not significantly different to that of SEP-GluA2 \u0394NTD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Moreover, diffusion in dendrites resembled the behavior of spine localized SEP-GluA2 \u0394NTD.

Both mutants readily trafficked to the cell surface and altered the RI in somatic patches similar to the WT subunits (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Transplanting the GluA2 NTD onto GluA1 (GluA1\u00a0+A2NTD) enhanced synaptic inward rectification (RI 0.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A1</a>) and increased response amplitudes relative to GluA1 WT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A2 and A3</a>), further demonstrating that the GluA2 NTD is able to promote AMPAR incorporation into synapses. In line with this, in neurons expressing GluA2Q\u00a0+A1NTD (i.e. the GluA2 NTD swapped for that of GluA1) response amplitudes were reduced relative to WT GluA2Q, approaching values obtained with GluA1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B2 and B3</a>). Therefore, the NTD of GluA2 appears to confer a unique \u2018synapto-sticky\u2019 phenotype that efficiently drives the receptor into synapses."

Our data are most compatible with an NTD-anchoring mechanism that is subunit-selective, mediated by this diversity, and supports some of the previous work on subunit-specific AMPAR trafficking (<a href=\"#bib43\">Malinow et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shi et al., 2001</a>). In line with these studies, we show that GluA2 integrates into synapses more efficiently than GluA1, an observation that is supported by previous AMPAR knockout data. In a conditional GluA2/3 knockout, GluA1 homomers are unable to maintain full synaptic transmission, despite providing a complete extrasynaptic pool of receptors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lu et al., 2009</a>), a deficit that is alleviated with GluA2 also present. As we show that replacement of the GluA1 NTD with that of GluA2 facilitates more robust incorporation into the synapse, N-terminal domain interactions appear to effectuate this subunit-specific anchoring. We also demonstrate that the GluA2 CTD facilitates synapse targeting, but alone, it is unable to stably position the receptor in the absence of the NTD. The depression in basal transmission seen in GluA2Q \u0394NTD expressing cells presumably occurs through sequestration of critical, subunit-specific interactors from native receptors, as this can be alleviated through CTD exchange with GluA1 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Interestingly, the GluA1 CTD is insufficient to deliver GluA1 to synapses and this subunit strictly depends on its NTD for targeting and anchoring."

While we observe that tCaMKII expression appears to drive synaptic incorporation of GluA1 \u0394NTD, without the AMPAR NTD, potentiation does not occur. Interestingly, potentiation cannot be achieved by native receptors in these cells, indicating a possible sequestration of important CTD interactors by GluA1 \u0394NTD in a similar manner to GluA2 under basal conditions, which is reminiscent of the conclusions of <a href=\"#bib61\">Shi et al. (2001)</a>. It is clear from somatic patch recordings that exogenously expressed receptors comprise the vast majority of the extrasynaptic pool. When LTP is induced in GluA1 \u0394NTD-expressing cells, rapid short-term potentiation is observed, yet this potentiation cannot be maintained. The transient short-term potentiation most likely requires NTD-independent AMPAR trafficking mechanisms, such as TARP phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Opazo et al., 2010</a>), highlighting the fine interplay of interactions that dictates AMPAR delivery to synapses. However, the synaptic rearrangements required for LTP appear critically dependent on the AMPAR NTD. We propose that a key requirement for LTP expression is stable receptor anchorage via the NTD, when the synapse is rearranged to a potentiated state."

The GluA2 NTD\u2019s affinity for the synaptic sites may allow critical control of synaptic signaling. As GluA2 renders AMPARs calcium-impermeable, this interaction has the potential to bias for GluA2-containing receptors, preventing excitotoxicity and controlling the potential signaling of calcium-permeable AMPARs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cull-Candy et al., 2006</a>)."

Whereas GFP-GluA1 is unable to traffic to the synapse without a potentiating stimulus (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hayashi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shi et al., 2001</a>), constitutive synaptic trafficking of GluA1 has been described, with the discrepancy being attributed to the N-terminal GFP tag (<a href=\"#bib21\">Granger et al., 2013</a>, but see <a href=\"#bib46\">Nabavi et al., 2014</a>). This can be explained by the essential requirement for the GluA1 NTD that we describe (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Similarly, we report an increase in AMPAR EPSC amplitude upon expression of GluA2Q (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), likely mediated by the increased channel conductance, which was not seen using N-terminally GFP-tagged GluA2Q (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shi et al., 2001</a>). The authors reported changes in rectification (and hence synaptic delivery of GluA2-GFP) but their construct did not give rise to elevated AMPAR amplitudes. We tested whether the presence of the tag could explain the discrepancy with our data. Indeed, inserting GFP upstream of the GluA2 NTD reduced current amplitudes to levels of untransfected control neurons (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), supporting the hypothesis that the GFP tag interferes with GluA2 synaptic anchoring. This effect has implications for interpretation of our FRAP data, but given the clear functional difference between GFP-GluA2 and GluA2 \u0394NTD, it appears that the GFP tag impairs but does not abolish GluA2 anchorage."

Images were acquired on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope using a 63X objective lens at 30 s intervals. Photobleaching was achieved by repetitive xy scanning of the region of interest at high laser intensity. Fluorescence during bleaching was monitored to ensure steady state complete bleaching was achieved and bleaching parameters were constant for all samples and repetitions. Analysis was conducted using Image J (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>). Photobleaching due to image acquisition was corrected by normalization to non-photobleached spines or dendrites, distant to a bleached spine."

The authors primarily used electrophysiological assays of transfected pyramidal neurons, including an elegant electrophysiological tagging technique to identify the localization and function of recombinant receptors. To study membrane trafficking of the constructs, the authors used pHluorin-tagged receptor constructs and observed their surface recovery with FRAP. Subunit specific effects of the N- and C-terminus of GluA1 and A2 were observed. In particular, the N-terminal domains (NTDs) of the AMPAR GluA1 and GluA2 subunits promote postsynaptic accumulation of AMPARs by reducing AMPAR mobility at postsynaptic sites. Moreover, the NTD of GluA1 is required for LTP."

Overexpression has the advantage that the level of synaptic incorporation can be measured and compared between exogenous AMPAR subunits (and their mutants) by the change in rectification index (RI), caused by replacement of endogenous with exogenous receptors. Mutants with deficits in trafficking, causing them to be less well-disposed than native receptors to anchor at the synapse can be better assayed with overexpression than in a knockout background where, without such competition, deficits will not be clearly exhibited. This approach has been successfully exploited by studies from the Malinow lab (e.g. Shi et al. Cell 2001)."

AMPAR auxiliary subunits are critical mediators of receptor trafficking (most prominently the TARPs), both in receptor delivery to the cell surface, and as a synaptic anchoring mechanism by binding to PSD-95 (see Chen et al. Nature2000; Schnell et al., PNAS2002). Hence, we assayed the level of auxiliary subunit association by recombinant receptors to understand if overexpressed receptors were less associated with auxiliary subunits than native receptors, and secondly, to determine if mutant AMPAR constructs show differential association with auxiliary subunits, which could explain the synaptic phenotypes that we observe."

We have used this assay on excised membrane patches and find that the KA/Glu ratio was no different either between wild-type and \u0394NTD receptors, between GluA subunits or on comparison to native receptors, showing that auxiliary subunit association is comparable in all conditions (revised manuscript <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5B1</a>, reproduced in <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 2</a>). This result confirms that 1) our overexpression does not appear to be at an extreme, or non-physiological level, as full auxiliary subunit association is observed, and 2) reduced auxiliary subunit interactions cannot account for the NTD dependent synaptic anchoring that we describe. These data are also in accordance with an earlier study by Kessels and Malinow (Kessels et al., Nat. Neurosci. 2009), who overexpressed GluA1 and GluA2 virally and demonstrated that TARPs are not limiting for dendritic AMPARs. Our new data are explained in the \u2018Results\u2019 section of the revised manuscript."

Using this approach, we also see a clear dependence of GluA2 on its NTD for synaptic anchoring, deletion of which reduces current rescue by approximately 50% .
