The flagellar shaft of some bacteria, including several human pathogens, is encased in a membranous sheath of unknown function. While it has been hypothesized that the sheath may allow these bacteria to evade host responses to the immunogenic flagellin subunit, this unusual structural feature has remained an enigma. Here we demonstrate that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in both the mutualist <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> promotes release of a potent bacteria-derived immunogen, lipopolysaccharide, found in the flagellar sheath. We further present a new role for the flagellar sheath in triggering, rather than circumventing, host immune responses in the model squid-vibrio symbiosis. Such an observation not only has implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella, but also raises important biophysical questions of sheathed-flagellum function."

The flagellar shaft of some bacteria, including several human pathogens, is encased in a membranous sheath of unknown function. While it has been hypothesized that the sheath may allow these bacteria to evade host responses to the immunogenic flagellin subunit, this unusual structural feature has remained an enigma. Here we demonstrate that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in both the mutualist <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> promotes release of a potent bacteria-derived immunogen, lipopolysaccharide, found in the flagellar sheath. We further present a new role for the flagellar sheath in triggering, rather than circumventing, host immune responses in the model squid-vibrio symbiosis. Such an observation not only has implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella, but also raises important biophysical questions of sheathed-flagellum function."

However, the immune system can detect parts of these flagella and eliminate the pathogen."

The function of this sheath is unclear, although some researchers have suggested that it might prevent the immune system from detecting the proteins in the flagellum. Now, by studying the interactions between the Hawaiian bobtail squid and a marine bacterium, Brennan et al. show that the sheath can actually alert the host that the bacteria are around."

This organ undergoes a number of developmental changes to house the bacteria, and the squid then uses the light from the bacteria to mask its own shadow, which helps it to avoid being detected by predators. Brennan et al. compared how wild-type bacteria and mutant bacteria that either had no flagella, or had flagella that did not rotate, interacted with young squid. Only bacteria with working flagella were able to trigger the normal development of the squid\u2019s light organ, which suggests that the rotating flagella are releasing the signal that tells the squid that the beneficial bacteria are present."

This molecule is known to activate the immune system in animals, and it is one of the bacterial signals that the squid responds to. Moreover, when the flagella of other bacteria with sheaths\u2014such as those that cause cholera\u2014are rotating, there is also an increase in the release of lipopolysaccharide. However, rotation of the flagella of bacteria without sheaths has no such effect. The next challenge will be to test the importance of this release of lipopolysaccharide from rotating flagella on the outcome of bacterial diseases of humans and other animals."

Besides mediating such migration, flagella serve additional functions, such as adherence to or invasion of host cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Young et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hayashi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Giron et al., 2002</a>). However, in most vertebrate models of pathogenesis, it has been difficult to separate the distinct contribution of flagellar motility in bacterial migration from its other roles, such as immune-system activation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Feuillet et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Andersen-Nissen et al., 2007</a>). Bacterial flagella are highly conserved on a molecular level, but display diversity in morphology, number and subcellular localization between species. One such variation is the presence of an outer membrane-derived sheath (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fuerst and Perry, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Geis et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ferooz and Letesson, 2010</a>). While the flagella of most bacteria are unsheathed, such a structure surrounds the filament of several polarly flagellated bacteria, including several with a host-associated lifestyle. The biological function(s) of the sheath remains unknown, but it has been posited to allow these bacteria to evade innate immune recognition of the enclosed flagellins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gewirtz et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yoon and Mekalanos, 2008</a>). This hypothesized role for the flagellar sheath presents a conundrum: what is the effect of coating a rapidly spinning structure with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), another potent immunostimulatory molecule? As the tools with which to study the flagellar sheath are limited, we sought to use the model symbiosis between <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and the Hawaiian bobtail squid, in which the events of initial colonization can be observed in real-time, to probe whether the sheathed flagellum plays a role in inducing a symbiont-specific host response."

                        "text": "<i>V. fischeri</i> is a gram-negative, bioluminescent bacterium that is found both in seawater and as a beneficial symbiont colonizing the light-emitting organs of certain fishes and squids. In the mutualism with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, <i>Euprymna scolopes</i>, symbiosis begins when a newly hatched squid specifically recruits <i>V. fischeri</i> cells from ambient seawater. The bacteria first aggregate on ciliated appendages of the light organ, and then migrate through pores and down ducts, ultimately reaching internal crypts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) where the symbiont population is housed (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 2004</a>). Successful colonization of the crypts ultimately requires flagellar motility, as amotile mutants are unable to colonize the light-organ to luminous levels (<a href=\"#bib18\">Graf et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brennan et al<i>.</i>, 2013</a>). However, the symbionts are sensed by host cells even before they reach the crypts. Indeed, as few as 3\u20135 bacteria interacting with the ciliated cells of the surface appendages signal both organ-wide changes in host transcription and immune-cell (hemocyte) trafficking (<a href=\"#bib22\">Koropatnick et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kremer et al., 2013</a>). Colonizing <i>V. fischeri</i> cells also induce an extensive morphogenesis of the light organ, beginning with the programmed cell death (apoptosis) of the ciliated appendages that begins within 6 hr of initial exposure to the symbiont, and continues until their complete regression (<a href=\"#bib30\">Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Foster et al., 2000</a>)."

Such amotile mutants do not successfully colonize the light-organ deep crypts (<a href=\"#bib18\">Graf et al., 1994</a>). However, as this apoptosis proceeds over the first few days of symbiotic colonization, we assessed this phenotype an early time-point (10 hr post-inoculation) to optimize apoptopic induction by <i>V. fischeri</i> while selecting conditions under which amotile mutants would not yet exhibit a colonization defect. As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib30\">Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1994</a>), squid that were not exposed to <i>V. fischeri</i> (i.e., aposymbiotic, or \u2018apo\u2019) exhibited much lower levels of apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,F</a>) than squid exposed to wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,F</a>). In contrast, exposure to either the <i>motB1</i> or the <i>flrA</i> strain did not induce early-stage apoptosis above the background levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). Because the actual location at which amotile mutants are arrested in symbiotic initiation has not been defined, we confirmed that both the location and number (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>) of bacteria at this early stage were indistinguishable in squid exposed to wild-type, <i>flrA</i> or <i>motB1</i> cells<i>.</i> These data show that flagellar motility plays a role in inducing a specific host immune response that is independent of its later role in migration into the light-organ crypts (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brennan et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that biosynthesis of the flagellum, and its subsequent functions, may mediate multiple aspects of symbiotic initiation."

                        "text": "Reports of flagellar-mediated activation of immunity have thus far been limited to responses to the filament protein, flagellin (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hayashi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Franchi et al., 2006</a>). Despite the flagellar sheath, flagellin monomers are a prevalent component of the secretome of both <i>V. cholerae</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Xicohtencatl-Cortes et al., 2006</a>) and <i>V. fischeri</i> (unpublished data). However, the failure of the fully flagellated <i>motB1</i> mutant to induce normal apoptosis demonstrated that the expression of immunogenic flagellin is insufficient to activate apoptosis in the light organ and, instead, suggests that apoptosis is driven by flagellar rotation itself. Previous work (<a href=\"#bib10\">Foster et al., 2000</a>) has shown that apoptosis of the light-organ ciliated epithelium is induced specifically by the lipid-A component of LPS (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 4 and 5</a>); indeed, LPS is a common activator of innate-immune defenses across the animal kingdom (<a href=\"#bib5\">Choi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Manna and Aggarwal, 1999</a>). However, no effect of flagellar motility on LPS presentation has been reported previously. We posited that, as sheath production and flagellar biogenesis may not be tightly coordinated (<a href=\"#bib37\">Richardson et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Josenhans et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ferooz and Letesson, 2010</a>), a sheathed flagellum might shed LPS due to a rotation-weakened association of the sheath with the spinning flagellar filament. This hypothesis is supported by negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of sheathed flagella, which has revealed vesicle-like structures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), often at the distal tip of the flagellum, and \u223c10\u201380 nm in diameter (<a href=\"#bib13\">Geis et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Millikan and Ruby, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ferooz and Letesson, 2010</a>). Such images are indicative of weaknesses between the flagellar sheath and shaft, which may be analogous to the foci of disassociation between the outer membrane and peptidoglycan required for the formation of cell-derived outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) (<a href=\"#bib26\">McBroom and Kuehn, 2007</a>). Thus, rotation of the flagellum would further destabilize these interactions, likely releasing LPS and activating an LPS-dependent immune response, rather than simply shielding against a host response."

In contrast, a similar analysis of an <i>Escherichia coli</i> mutant unable to rotate its (unsheathed) flagella revealed no alteration in levels of released LPS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), further indicating that this behavior may be specific to bacteria that sheath their flagella.

                        "text": "Using the model squid-vibrio symbiosis as a tool to probe the effect of the enigmatic flagellar sheath on host recognition, we uncover a previously unrecognized role for the rotation of sheathed flagella in mediating the release of the immunogenic molecule LPS in both <i>V. fischeri</i> and its pathogenic congener <i>V. cholerae</i>. The flagellar sheath has proved problematic to study; indeed, to our knowledge, there are no mutations that result in the loss of a sheath in otherwise sheathed flagella. Intriguingly, a few <i>Vibrio</i> species, including the human pathogen <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>, encode two independent flagellar structures: one set producing sheathed, the other unsheathed flagella (<a href=\"#bib27\">McCarter, 1999</a>). However, pleiotropic effects of mutations in these distinct pathways as well as other technical limitations make a direct comparison of unsheathed and sheathed flagella within this species difficult to interpret (L McCarter, personal communication). Thus, the functional role of the sheath, even as it relates to bacterial motility, remains poorly characterized, and observation of this new phenomenon for the flagellar sheath furthers our understanding of this enigmatic structure and its contribution to bacterial virulence. As this behavior is difficult to probe experimentally, novel approaches, such as the modeling of the biophysical properties underlying lipid-membrane behavior at a sub-micron scale, are needed to inform our understanding of the interactions between the sheath and filament along the length of the flagellum, as well as the physical forces at play between a rotating flagellar sheath and the contiguous, but static, cellular outer membrane. While vesicle-like structures have only been reported at the flagellar tip of <i>V. fischeri</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Millikan and Ruby, 2004</a>), another possible region from which LPS may be shed during rotation is the base of the flagellum where the basal body perturbs the outer membrane. Interestingly, cryotomographic imaging has revealed unusual features in the <i>Vibrio</i> flagellar basal body that may help stabilize this interaction (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2011</a>)."

Further, by activating the squid\u2019s developmental program in response to symbiont exposure, the flagellar sheath may serve to promote recognition by the host immune system, suggesting the context-dependent nature (mutualism or pathogenesis) of this behavior. Perhaps masking one immunostimulatory molecule (e.g., flagellin) with another (e.g., LPS) can serve to modulate, rather than simply avoid (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gewirtz et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yoon and Mekalanos, 2008</a>), detection by the host immune system."

This last point emphasizes the microheterogeneous chemical structures of LPS made by bacteria like <i>V. fischeri</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Phillips et al., 2011</a>). This heterogeneity, as well as LPS\u2019s insolubility in aqueous solution and the toxicity of spent medium to juvenile squid, makes directly comparing the chemical concentration or specific activity of LPS between culture and symbiotic settings problematic. In this symbiosis, the LPS is produced by a few non-growing bacterial cells at a tissue interface, in high flow-field conditions that further confound quantification."

Alternatively, LPS released from either the tip or base of the flagellum might form vesicles with a smaller diameter than the cell-derived OMVs, thereby enabling tighter interaction with the host-cell surfaces. Further work will build upon these discoveries and clarify the mechanisms underlying signaling during initiation of the squid-vibrio symbiosis; such work includes characterizing the composition of LPS released by <i>V. fischeri</i> during flagellar rotation, identifying the squid receptors that recognize <i>V. fischeri</i> LPS (<a href=\"#bib16\">Goodson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Krasity et al., 2011</a>), and determining any role flagellin may have in activating host responses."

After 9.5 hr in PGN-FSIO containing the <i>V. fischeri</i> inoculum, animals were exposed to Cell Tracker Orange CMRA (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 min to label host tissue. Squid were then anesthetized in 2% ethanol in FSIO, pithed, and examined by LSCM as described previously (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nyholm et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sycuro et al., 2006</a>). Bacterial localization was determined by the presence of GFP-fluorescing cells, relative to notable features of the juvenile light organ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Data indicate the location of the bacterial aggregate that has progressed the furthest in a single light-organ lobe, for 13\u201315 squid per condition. Thus, the decreased induction of apoptosis by these mutants does not result simply from a differential arrest earlier in migration into the light organ crypts."

These associations include those of important human pathogens like <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. The work uncovered that rotation of the flagella results in release of LPS (endotoxin) from bacterial cells. The LPS serves to stimulate apoptosis in relevant host cells. What I particularly like about the manuscript is that the authors use a special mutualistic association that is very well suited to uncover this novel function of sheathed flagella. They go on to present some limited evidence that this could very well be relevant in the pathogen V. cholerae. I have one single concern of substance and a number of more cosmetic issues."

They also present data showing that these strains have less capacity to induce epithelial apoptosis in the squid, the first step of symbiont-induced morphogenesis.

They also do not establish whether the alleged outer membrane vesicles at the tips of wild type flagella, observed in electron micrographs, require flagellar motility for their production."

It's possible that lipid A is more potent than crude LPS. However, the real difference in these two sets of results is the extent of apoptosis induced by the symbiont, with significantly lower numbers in this manuscript's figure.

For example, rotation of the flagellar shaft at the point of connection with the cellular membrane could enhance release of PGN. The authors should test whether levels of peptidoglycan and/or peptidoglycan monomers are reduced in the supernatant of the flrA, motB, and motX mutants relative to wild type cells. Additionally, the flagellin monomers that the authors state are secreted by wild type <i>V. fischeri</i> may act in conjunction with LPS to stimulate morphogenesis and these may well be reduced in the mutants."

The Koropatnick et al. paper measures apoptosis after 24 h, well into the persistence stage of the symbiosis, and many hours after <i>V. fischeri</i> cells have already colonized the light-organ crypts and undergone substantial proliferation (\u223c100,000-fold). At such post-colonization time points, LPS/lipid A synergizes with TCT to drive apoptosis into its later stages. In contrast, at the 10-h time point examined in this study, LPS/lipid A is the inducing molecule, and TCT has no known synergistic effect. This difference in experimental timing (10 h vs 24 h) also accounts for the higher numbers of apoptotic nuclei reported in that publication (as noted by Reviewer 2)."

The level of peptidoglycan added to the bacteria-free artificial seawater to induce mucus shedding in this experiment would likely negate the effect of any differences in TCT release between the test strains and the aposymbiotic condition at this early time point (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, panels B and F). In fact, the absence of significant apoptosis in the aposymbiotic squid (which were exposed to the added peptidoglycan) confirms that this addition is insufficient to induce acridine-orange staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We have added this point to the figure legend for clarification. Further, unpublished data from a different study that examined another host response during initiation (hemocyte trafficking into the light organ appendages, which is induced by TCT alone) indicates there is no significant difference in this TCT-dependent response between squid exposed to either wild-type or <i>motB1</i> strains of <i>V. fischeri</i>."

As we mention in the Discussion, we expect that the manner in which LPS is presented is an important part of the way it is sensed by the host cells, and that culture supernatants contain LPS released not only by flagellar rotation, but also from other sources like outer membrane vesicles, cell lysis, etc, that have accumulated during growth. In the context of symbiotic initiation, during which there is no <i>V. fischeri</i> proliferation within the timeframe of our experiments, such other sources are less likely to be relevant to the induction of early-stage apoptosis.

As described in an earlier response (combined-review comment #2), the different numbers of apoptotic nuclei reported in the two works is because they are examining the tissues at two different time points during symbiotic colonization. In Koropatnick et al., the authors were examining a later time point (24 h post-inoculation), by which time the symbionts have colonized the light organ\u2019s deep crypts and undergone many rounds of doubling. In the work presented here, we are examining the induction of early-stage apoptosis that occurs when non-growing <i>V. fischeri</i> cells are still initiating the symbiosis (10 h post-inoculation), well before they reach the deep crypts, where subsequent proliferation occurs. While inoculated animals have significantly higher apoptosis levels than uninoculated ones at both 10 and 24 h, this developmental (and experimental) difference accounts for the higher absolute numbers of apoptotic nuclei observed in the Koropatnick et al. study."

For example, rotation of the flagellar shaft at the point of connection with the cellular membrane could enhance release of PGN. The authors should test whether levels of peptidoglycan and/or peptidoglycan monomers are reduced in the supernatant of the flrA, motB, and motX mutants relative to wild type cells.

As for the cellular location of LPS shedding, we completely agree that another possible source of the released LPS could be the interface at the base of the flagellum, between the flagellar sheath and the static outer membrane. Currently, though, there exists no evidence to support this hypothesis. It would clearly be an important next step to ask whether there are additional molecules (such as flagellin) that might be differentially shed between these strains, and what their activity might be (synergistically or otherwise). However, in this manuscript we have described a new role for the rotation of the sheathed flagellum, and believe that testing all other candidate surface components for their presence and possible synergy will take considerable effort, and is beyond the scope of this initial announcement and characterization of an important discovery."

This is not even a specific effect: as a similar blocking of colonization occurs with the addition of an antibody to OmpU, the bacterium\u2019s major outer membrane porin (Aeckersburg et al., 2001)."

Our purpose in mentioning a threshold LPS level is only to suggest that a relatively small difference in LPS release might trigger a significant host response. Because the light organ\u2019s surface epithelium is constantly exposed to seawater, it experiences the low levels of LPS generated by the presence of the naturally occurring bacterioplankton; thus, these host cells must differentiate between an \u2018authentic\u2019 indicator of the presence of the symbiont (\u223c10<sup>3</sup> cells/ml), and this background \u2018noise\u2019 of the normal bacterioplankton (&gt;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml). Such a dilemma suggests that the signaling pathways are finely tuned to the additional LPS presented by the rotating flagella of the 5-10 <i>V. fischeri</i> cells attached directly to the host tissue (Altura et al). Thus, it is hard to estimate the amount of LPS released by individual cells during symbiotic initiation. As previously mentioned, the few <i>V. fischeri</i> cells initiating the response are not growing during the early hours of the association examined here, and the dilution effect of the flow field around the cilia to which they are attached is a mystery; thus, even back-of-the envelope calculations based on LPS release in culture require substantial, unsupported, assumptions be made. In any case, we agree that this is an important point to clarify for the reader, and have added to the text to describe it."

Instead, we feel the most rigorous and quantitative indication of LPS shedding is the measurement of LPS in culture supernatants we performed.
