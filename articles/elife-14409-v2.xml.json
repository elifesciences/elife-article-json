In Hose <i>et al.,</i> we argued that this gene group is enriched for genes subject to one or more modes of dosage compensation, where mRNA abundance is decreased in response to higher dosage of that gene. A recent manuscript by Torres <i>et al.</i> refutes our prior work. Here, we provide a response to Torres <i>et al.</i>, along with additional analysis and controls to support our original conclusions. We maintain that aneuploidy is well tolerated in the wild strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> that we studied and that the group of genes enriched for those subject to dosage compensation show unique evolutionary signatures."

In Hose <i>et al.,</i> we argued that this gene group is enriched for genes subject to one or more modes of dosage compensation, where mRNA abundance is decreased in response to higher dosage of that gene. A recent manuscript by Torres <i>et al.</i> refutes our prior work. Here, we provide a response to Torres <i>et al.</i>, along with additional analysis and controls to support our original conclusions. We maintain that aneuploidy is well tolerated in the wild strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> that we studied and that the group of genes enriched for those subject to dosage compensation show unique evolutionary signatures."

We argued that this group is enriched for genes whose expression is regulated by one or more modes of gene-dosage compensation, which we validated at several genes. Importantly, the group of genes we identified shows non-random associations, including enrichment for specific functional groups, enrichment for genes that are toxic when over-expressed in the lab strain, and a higher rate of gene copy-number variation (CNV) despite higher constraint on expression variation in wild isolates of yeast.

They take this to reflect heterogeneous populations in which cells in the culture have lost the aneuploidy. However, this is not valid for several reasons. Due to technical biases in Illumina sequencing, it is highly unlikely that the mean value of relative gene copy number across whole chromosomes is a precise integer. Indeed, the plots shown by Torres <i>et al.</i> indicate the expected spread in relative read depth across the amplified chromosomes \u2013 similar to the spread in read counts of the euploid chromosomes \u2013 with mean values very close to the relative DNA abundance we reported. Furthermore, some genes on the chromosomes are not amplified (particularly those near the telomeres [<a href=\"#bib12\">Hose et al., 2015</a>]), which can also slightly reduce the mean value away from a precise integer."

It is true that some chromosome amplifications, namely in sake strains, are variable (appearing or disappearing) across replicates, and thus these chromosomes (Torres <i>et al.</i> Figure 1F and 2F) were not considered as part of this work. The karyotype of these sake strains may indeed be somewhat \u2018unstable\u2019 at the culture level; however, the random appearance of extra chromosomes across replicates again suggests a low fitness cost to aneuploidy and an observable rate of mitotic errors (<a href=\"#bib31\">Zhu et al., 2014</a>).

(In cases where we cited the specific growth rate, we always verified that aneuploidy remained at the end of the experiment by relative qPCR.) Thus, aneuploidy tolerance is not due to unusual adaptation in the lab. In contrast, the tetrasomic W303_Chr12-4n strain \u2013 carrying a chromosome reported to be one of the least toxic in this background (<a href=\"#bib18\">Sheltzer et al., 2012</a>) \u2013 has a 70% reduction in growth rate compared to its isogenic control (Hose <i>et al.</i> Figure 5B). 3) While extra chromosomes can be lost stochastically, it generally took &gt;200 generations of growth to detect significant chromosome loss in the wild-strain cultures we analyzed. W303_Chr12-4n cultures reproducibly lose the extra chromosome in one culture passaging (~20 generations). The extreme fitness defect incurred by the aneuploid W303 strain explains the rapid emergence of cells that lose the extra chromosome, since the euploid W303 grows nearly twice as fast and rapidly takes over the culture. 4) Aneuploid W303 cells show aberrant gene expression and strong activation of the environmental stress response (ESR, [<a href=\"#bib8\">Gasch et al., 2000</a>]), regardless of the chromosome amplified (<a href=\"#bib18\">Sheltzer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Torres et al., 2007</a>).

It is certainly possible that some wild strains will not tolerate aneuploidy, and likely that some chromosome amplifications are more problematic than others, regardless of strain background. The prevalence of aneuploidy in our original study is consistent with other reports of aneuploidy in wild isolates (<a href=\"#bib23\">Tan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Strope et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Sirr et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Muller and McCusker, 2009</a>) and certainly industrial strains (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bakalinsky and Snow, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bond et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Hadfield et al., 1995</a>). Aneuploidy commonly emerges in response to selective pressure (<a href=\"#bib13\">Mulla et al., 2014</a>); interestingly, a recent study by Filteau <i>et al.</i> showed that aneuploidy was relatively frequent in a wild strain, but not a laboratory strain, subjected to the same selection conditions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Filteau et al., 2015</a>). W303 harbors six auxotrophies, several of which affect but do not entirely explain the intolerance of Chr12 amplification (unpublished). Thus, while many nice studies have been done with the W303 laboratory strain, we caution against using it (or any single strain) as the sole representative of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gasch et al., 2016</a>)."

First, we measured mRNA abundance (in biological duplicate) for three aneuploid strains and their isogenic euploids and compared relative mRNA abundance to relative DNA abundance measured in those strain pairs (outlined in more detail below). This identified 163 of 882 genes (or 18% of the total set of genes assessed across these three strains) with lower-than-expected expression in aneuploid cells (Hose <i>et al.</i> Figure 4B and Supplementary File 3). Second, we generated isogenic strain panels for two other naturally aneuploid strains, in which diploid cells carried two, three, or four copies of the amplified chromosome. Using a mixture-of-linear regressions (MLR) model, we defined genes whose relative mRNA abundance did not increase proportionately to relative DNA abundance measured in the aneuploid versus isogenic euploid strains. The MLR analysis identified 172 genes in this class out of 773 genes (or 22% of the genes assessed in these two strain panels, Hose <i>et al</i>., Table 1, Class 3a). We then combined the gene groups from the two analyses of isogenic strain sets for downstream analysis. Because the paired strain analysis was less stringent (in part because only duplicates were analyzed), we required that genes be identified in both Figure 4B (isogenic strain pairs) and Figure 4A (non-isogenic strain pairs). This left 73 genes whose expression was lower-than-expected in <i>four biological measurements</i> from isogenic strain pairs plus the 172 genes identified by the more sensitive MLR analysis from the isogenic strain panels, for a combined total of 245 genes out of 1655 (15%) total genes assessed in the two analyses of isogenic strains. In Hose <i>et al.</i>, we cited that 10\u201330% of genes, depending on strain and chromosome, met our criteria. There was an error in the abstract of the published article that we request to be changed, where '&gt;30%' should have read 'up to 30%' of genes may be subjected to dosage compensation. We regret the error, but point out that the correct values are cited clearly throughout the manuscript."

For each replicate, we measured the relative mRNA abundance for each gene in the aneuploid versus euploid strain, as well as the relative DNA abundance for that gene in the aneuploid versus euploid strain. We then defined a gene-specific threshold to identify genes with lower-than-expected mRNA abundance: we took the relative DNA abundance measured for a given gene, minus one SD of the chromosome-wide mean of relative DNA abundances (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We then identified genes whose relative mRNA abundance in the aneuploid versus euploid strain was lower than the gene-specific cutoff <i>in both biological mRNA replicates.</i> Comparing measured mRNA ratios to measured DNA ratios (as opposed to theoretical DNA ratios) is critical to capture systematic and stochastic variation in the measurements. Our thresholding method allowed us to account for gene-specific biases in sequencing counts while incorporating measurement noise (and minimizing sequencing costs). Importantly, to meet our criteria for downstream analysis, a gene must have also met these criteria in the comparable analysis of non-isogenic strain pairs (Hose <i>et al.</i> Figure 4A). Thus, each gene had to be expressed below the threshold in <i>four biological replicates</i>. We note that it would be inappropriate to analyze the mean gene-level values from small numbers of replicates, which was not done in our analyses. In attempt to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR), we performed random permutations on the data (see Methods). We estimate the FDR for this analysis to be below 15%."

However, we did not use abundance values, but rather <i>relative</i> abundance across isogenic strains, and thus the SD of RPKM values across all transcripts is not relevant to our analysis. What is relevant is the SD of <i>replicate</i> mRNA abundance ratios compared to the SD of the relative DNA values used to define the threshold applied to replicates. The average SD of the replicate mRNA ratios for each gene ranged from 0.12\u20130.3, for amplified genes and for unamplified genes. This was the same range as the SDs of the relative DNA abundance ratios (0.17\u20130.24) used to define the gene-specific thresholds (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), which were applied to four biological measurements of relative mRNA abundance. Torres <i>et al.</i> attempt to estimate the false discovery rate of our method on permuted data; while their methods are not entirely clear, they identify hundreds more genes on randomized data than we did on real data, and the SD values cited in their Table 2 are not close to our values, suggesting critical differences in methods."

In fitting the MLR model, we did not average the replicates to reduce data to three points in a scatterplot per gene \u2013 such an approach could be adversely affected by outliers. Instead, we used all replicate measurements on all genes simultaneously, contrary to the assertion in Torres <i>et al.</i> The model takes into account variation in the replicate mRNA measurements (see Hose <i>et al.</i> for details). For simplicity, we classified genes based on their maximum posterior probability, and no cutoff on the magnitude of the expression effect was used \u2013 indeed, we showed in the paper that many genes have only partially reduced expression (Hose <i>et al.</i> Figure 4 and 6). Though it was not a focus of the original report, the MLR mixture model allows for a conditional FDR assessment, following the approach in <a href=\"#bib15\">Newton et al. (2004)</a>.

Under normal theory, the likelihood ratio test statistic has a chi-squared distribution on 2 degrees of freedom. An estimate of the proportion of null genes comes by processing the collection of chi-square p-values through Storey's q-value calculator (<a href=\"#bib21\">Storey, 2003</a>). For both strain panels, these null proportion estimates are remarkably close to the Class 1 proportion estimates from MLR (in the YPS1009 panel: 14% by q-value and 15% by MLR; in the NCYC110 panel: 7% by q-value and 8% by MLR, both among the set of genes showing linear relationships on the log scale mRNA versus DNA). The likelihood ratio approach does not offer a direct classification of non-null genes, in contrast to the favored MLR approach used in Hose <i>et al.</i>, but does provide a check on inferences about the breath of putative-dosage compensation effects. In summary, the two methods we used to identify genes expressed lower-than-expected in isogenic aneuploid versus euploid strains identified 245 genes for downstream analysis. This amounts to 10 to 30% of genes depending on the strain and affected chromosome, or 15% of all genes assessed, at an FDR between 5\u00a0and\u00a017%."

Nonetheless, as we describe in Hose <i>et al.</i>, the two tails of the distribution are enriched for different functional groups: whereas amplified genes with lower-than-expected expression are enriched for particular functional groups (see below) and for genes that are toxic when over-expressed in the lab strain, the set of amplified genes with higher-than-expected expression is enriched for genes encoding membrane and cell-surface proteins. As we cited, the higher-than-expected expression of amplified genes (and of\u00a0genes on unamplified chromosomes) is likely an indirect response to the known influence that ploidy has on cell size/shape and flocculence (<a href=\"#bib30\">Wu et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, we do not believe that the distribution across all genes can be used to select individual genes subject to dosage compensation, nor did we focus on global averages or correlations.

Such non-random associations are unlikely to occur if the gene selection was truly random and driven by noisy data.

However, it is true that a subset of the genes we identified could be responding transcriptionally to the particular chromosome amplified, rather than the gene\u2019s copy number <i>per se</i>. We attempted to minimize these effects in our original downstream analysis by pooling amplified genes from five aneuploid strains and across three amplified chromosomes.

For simplicity, the buffering score plotted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> represents the number of 103 strains with CNV divided by the expression constraint score V<sub>g</sub>/V<sub>m</sub> (see Hose <i>et al.</i> for details). We performed a variety of other controls, ensuring that trends were the same when each chromosome was held out separately, when genes belonging to any functional group were held out, and using different cutoffs for CNV. The trends were consistent in all cases (although not always statistically significant owing to small datasets in some cases)."

Their argumentation in the chapter \"Unique features of selected genes....\" is a prime example of scientific tautology: genes are dosage compensated because it is disadvantageous for the cells to overexpress them. Accordingly, for these genes a propensity to CNV is observed. They do not observe propensity to CNV for genes from these categories when they are present in normal copy numbers \u2013 but this is most likely because they are not overexpressed and therefore there is no need to select against them!

The important points from this section are: 1) the most accurate method of <i>Sz. pombe</i> spike-in normalization gives comparable normalization to the more robust RPKM (aside of one strain, for which the spike-in normalization was clearly off, for reasons we describe in the text); 2) the center of the distributions for RPKM-normalized mRNA ratios was very similar to the center of distributions for RPKM-normalized DNA ratios; 3) the SDs used for thresholding are significantly higher than any difference in data mean centers. Thus, there is no evidence that misnormalization of the data has dramatically affected our results. The point raised by this reviewer about capturing technical biases in Illumina data is the precise reason why we compare relative mRNA abundance measured in each strain pair to relative DNA abundance measured in the same way (see more below). We again highlight that the significant enrichment for functionally related genes among the selected group strongly suggests that we have not selected random genes, but rather enriched for functionally related groups."

I do think that this suggests that the strains could indeed be unstable. However, I also noted that we need to be sure that sequencing biases are not involved. I suggested a few relatively easy experiments to verify whether the populations are homogeneous and whether they show the expected aneuploidies. It seems easy enough to measure the copy number of a few key regions in a few key strains using qPCR, and to do this on a few different (small) colonies of the same culture. This would close the discussion.</i>"

For five of the strains we worked with, we have done a similar analysis, first at the culture level and finally on individual colonies from a passaged culture, that shows that in most cases the aneuploidies are quite stable (but can be lost stochastically, see text for details). Therefore, we have opted not to add more of these comparisons at this time."

Even if some GO enrichment is found in this set, it is not clear to me that the number is high enough to call this \"widespread\". My best guess is that strains become aneuploid and the relatively quickly acquire mutations that normalize the expression of a few key genes for which changes in expression are not tolerated. Whether this is special for wild yeasts and should be called \"dosage compensation\" is a difficult question (obviously, the dosage is compensated, but using the name also suggests a general, dedicated mechanism, and this may very well be lacking</i>\u2026)"

Indeed, we do not believe that dosage compensation functions at most yeast genes. Our main interest in this manuscript was to show that genes potentially subject to dosage compensation display unique evolutionary patterns. We agree that there is unlikely a single or universal mode of dosage compensation analogous to the silencing of sex chromosomes, for example, and we did not indent to claim that in our original manuscript. With regard to the acquisition of rapid mutations that down-regulate genes: this was the main motivation for deriving the isogenic strain panels, since heritable polymorphisms that down-regulate genes as part of an adaptive response would be detected in our analysis. It is certainly possible that this occurs at some of the genes with heritably reduced expression that we identified in Hose et al., but it cannot explain the reduced expression per gene copy in our isogenic strain groups."

Gasch (in Hose and Gasch) seek to take a gene specific view that accounts for gene-to-gene variability. This is noble and philosophically sound, but fraught with problems they don't address \u2013 namely that they have way too small a sample size to *really* do this (as also noted by both other reviewers). The Amon approach is to take a more distribution-based approach \u2013 which is, in principle, better in low sample sizes \u2013 but as Gasch correctly points out (and was a major criticism of the Torres manuscript) \u2013 the Torres methods are so poorly described as to be impossible to assess. Even if you think the Gasch method has merit, in the end they do back peddle on the number of dosage compensated genes (in Gasch compared to Hose) leading one to suspect we are talking about something that is either a small class or even non-existent.</i>"

In this regard, both our groups agree that there is no evidence for a chromosome-wide mechanism of dosage compensation. We do believe that we have statistical power to identify genes subject to dosage compensation, and the fact that the gene groups we identified are enriched for myriad features of interest reveals that our results simply cannot be explained away as noise. Our more stringent analysis in this work presents a restricted gene set, which while on the lower end of the range we cited in Hose et al. remains consistent with our original claims. Fundamentally important to us are the evolutionary signatures and functional enrichments among the gene set we identified \u2013 while the numbers may appear small depending on perspective, it is the impact on evolution that we center on."
