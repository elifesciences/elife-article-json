While Ngn1 substantially suppresses the activation of the astrogliogenic Jak-Stat pathway, the underlying molecular mechanism was unknown. Here, by employing <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> approaches, we report that Ngn1 binds to the promoter of a brain-enriched microRNA, miR-9, and activates its expression during neurogenesis. Subsequently, our <i>in vitro</i> study showed that miR-9 directly targets mRNAs of <i>Lifr-beta</i>, <i>Il6st (gp130)</i>, and <i>Jak1</i> to down-regulate these critical upstream components of the Jak-Stat pathway, achieving inhibition of Stat phosphorylation and consequently, suppression of astrogliogenesis. This study revealed Ngn1 modulated non-coding RNA epigenetic regulation during cell fate specifications."
