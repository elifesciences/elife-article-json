Here, we study dormancy in different eukaryotic organisms and find it to be associated with a significant decrease in the mobility of organelles and foreign tracer particles. We show that this reduced mobility is caused by an influx of protons and a marked acidification of the cytoplasm, which leads to widespread macromolecular assembly of proteins and triggers a transition of the cytoplasm to a solid-like state with increased mechanical stability. We further demonstrate that this transition is required for cellular survival under conditions of starvation. Our findings have broad implications for understanding alternative physiological states, such as quiescence and dormancy, and create a new view of the cytoplasm as an adaptable fluid that can reversibly transition into a protective solid-like state."

Here, we study dormancy in different eukaryotic organisms and find it to be associated with a significant decrease in the mobility of organelles and foreign tracer particles. We show that this reduced mobility is caused by an influx of protons and a marked acidification of the cytoplasm, which leads to widespread macromolecular assembly of proteins and triggers a transition of the cytoplasm to a solid-like state with increased mechanical stability. We further demonstrate that this transition is required for cellular survival under conditions of starvation. Our findings have broad implications for understanding alternative physiological states, such as quiescence and dormancy, and create a new view of the cytoplasm as an adaptable fluid that can reversibly transition into a protective solid-like state."

It is very crowded and contains many molecules and compartments called organelles that carry out a variety of vital processes. The cytoplasm has long been considered to be fluid-like in nature, but recent evidence suggests that in bacterial cells it can solidify to resemble a soft glass-type material under certain conditions. When cells become dormant they stop dividing and reorganise their cytoplasm in several ways; for example, the water content drops and many essential proteins form storage compartments. However, it was not clear how cells regulate the structure of the cytoplasm to enter into or exit from dormancy."

The experiments show that when yeast cells are deprived of energy \u2013 as happens during dormancy \u2013 the cytoplasm becomes more acidic than normal. This limits the ability of molecules and organelles to move around the cytoplasm. Similar results were also seen in other types of fungi and an amoeba. Munder et al. found that this increase in acidity during dormancy causes many proteins to interact with each other and form large clumps or filament structures that result in the cytoplasm becoming stiffer."

Together, the findings of the studies suggest that the interior of cells can undergo a transition from a fluid-like to a more solid-like state to protect the cells from damage when energy is in short supply. The next challenge is to understand the molecular mechanisms that cause the physical properties of the cytoplasm to change under different conditions."

However, organisms typically live in unpredictable environments and frequently experience conditions that are not optimal for growth and reproduction.

It often involves execution of a developmental program, which culminates in the formation of specialized cell types such as spores, seeds, or cysts. These cell types can endure long periods of nutrient starvation, low temperatures, and even desiccation. Dormancy is also accompanied by extensive changes in cellular architecture, some of which are drastic. For instance, dormant cells have a very low water content, their cytoplasm is densely packed, and they show strongly diminished intracellular dynamics (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ablett et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cowan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dijksterhuis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Parry et al., 2014</a>).

Findings made in such dilute regimes have been extrapolated to the cellular interior. In recent years awareness has been increasing that the cellular environment is very different from such dilute regimes. One reason for this is that the cytoplasm is densely packed with macromolecules. The overall concentration of macromolecules in the cytoplasm is estimated to be around 200\u2013350 mg/ml (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ellis, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Zimmerman and Trach, 1991</a>), which amounts to a volume fraction of up to 40%. This dense packing of macromolecules is referred to as macromolecular crowding. How macromolecules remain soluble at such high concentrations inside a cell is unknown, but it presumably involves a fine balance of attractive and repulsive interactions between the different cytoplasmic components."

Based on these findings, proposals have been made about the physical nature of the cytoplasm, which has either been described as a hydrogel (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fels et al., 2009</a>) or, more recently, as a liquid at the transition to a glass-like state (<a href=\"#bib56\">Parry et al., 2014</a>). Because many metabolic reactions and signaling processes take place in the cytoplasm, changes in its physicochemical properties should have far-reaching effects on cellular function and survival."

These structures may constitute storage depots for proteins and RNAs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Daignan-Fornier and Sagot, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Laporte et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sagot et al., 2006</a>). Indeed, several metabolic enzymes assemble into filamentous structures in response to starvation, and the formation of these filaments leads to enzymatic inactivation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Petrovska et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, the enzymes contained in these filaments can be reused, when cells escape from dormancy. This suggests that cells may regulate the structure of the cytoplasm to enter into and exit from a metabolically inactive state."

We show that this transition arrests the movement of organelles and foreign tracer particles. We provide further evidence that this state of reduced intracellular mobility is required for survival of energy depletion stress. Thus, we propose that organisms have global control mechanisms in place to fine-tune the material properties of the cytoplasm, allowing them to enter into a protective solid-like state, when challenged by extreme environmental conditions."

Induction of a dormant state was achieved by treating yeast cells with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, an inhibitor of glycolysis) and antimycin A (an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration), a treatment that decreases cellular ATP levels by more than 95% (<a href=\"#bib68\">Serrano, 1977</a>).

Therefore, foreign tracer particles are better suited as probes of the subcellular environment. However, direct injection methods of foreign particles, as they have been developed for mammalian cells, are not feasible for yeast cells because of their small size. We therefore adopted a technique that relies on a genetically encoded viral capsid protein (\u00b5NS), which has been used successfully in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib56\">Parry et al., 2014</a>). We could show that GFP-\u00b5NS self-assembles into distinct particles in the yeast cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

Using GFP-\u00b5NS particles and SPT, we found that energy depletion caused a similar reduction in the mobility of these foreign particles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, we conclude that upon energy depletion, the cytoplasm of budding yeast transitions into a state with strongly reduced dynamics."

These effects are predominantly driven by motor proteins, which are linked to the cytoskeleton. However, in contrast to mammalian cells, yeast cells have a cell wall, and thus only a rudimentary cytoskeleton, which is primarily based on actin. Importantly, the actin cytoskeleton of yeast disassembles upon starvation (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sagot et al., 2006</a>), suggesting that this event may be responsible for the reduced particle mobility by removing tracks for motor-based mixing. To test this, we depolymerized the actin cytoskeleton by adding the drug latrunculin A (LatA) to dividing yeast cells. Indeed, GFP-\u00b5NS particle mobility was reduced, but the effect was much less pronounced than under conditions of energy depletion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Next, we treated yeast cells with the drug nocodazole to inhibit microtubule-based motor movements. Again, we only observed marginal effects on particle mobility (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This indicates that a lack of active motor-driven movements can only partially explain the reduced particle mobility."

However, the cytosolic pH is kept in the neutral range by proton-translocating ATPases such as Pma1, which use a large amount of energy to continuously pump protons out of the cell, thus preventing cytosolic acidification (<a href=\"#bib51\">Orij et al., 2011</a>). In agreement with this, previous studies have reported that energy depletion leads to a drop in cytosolic pH (pHc) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dechant et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Orij et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, using a ratiometric, pH-sensitive variant of GFP (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mahon, 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we observed a significant pHc\u00a0decrease from around 7.3 to around 5.8 in yeast cells that were energy-depleted in normal growth medium of pH 5.5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). If this drop in pHc was responsible for the reduced particle mobility, it should be possible to prevent particle immobilization by keeping the pHc in the neutral range. Indeed, when yeast cells were energy-depleted in growth medium of neutral pH, cytosolic acidification could be prevented (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and the reduction in particle mobility was much less pronounced (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Thus, we conclude that strong energy depletion leads to a rapid drop in cytosolic pH, which in turn causes reduced particle mobility."

The protonophore DNP rapidly carries protons across the cell membrane and effectively equilibrates the intracellular with the extracellular pH (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dechant et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Petrovska et al., 2014</a>). This allowed us to manipulate the intracellular pH by keeping cells in DNP-containing buffers of different pH (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, left panel). Cells exposed to DNP-containing buffers generally showed a reduced particle mobility, when compared to cells growing in medium (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), most likely because of direct effects of DNP on metabolism. However, the particle mobility was much more strongly reduced at pHc 6 and 5.5 than at pH 7.0 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, right panel). To exclude possible secondary effects of DNP, we also used a mild membrane-permeable acid (sorbic acid) to alter pHc (<a href=\"#bib52\">Orij et al., 2009</a>) and found that it had a similar effect on cytosolic pH (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, left panel) and on particle mobility (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, right panel). These experiments were performed in the presence of glucose as an energy source, suggesting that the pHc change acts downstream of ATP depletion."

                                "text": "Our findings so far show that the mobility of particles is reduced upon energy depletion and acidification of the cytoplasm. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, we show the MSDs and their subdiffusive scaling for different experimental conditions. Particles of all sizes were included in the analysis. We see a dramatic decrease in particle mobility for energy depleted and acidified cells. To gain more insight into the rheological properties of the cytoplasm, which might explain this behavior, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the particle trajectories. From a rheological point of view, the cytoplasm can be considered as an active viscoelastic material (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mizuno et al., 2007</a>). The motion of an inert tracer particle in the cytoplasm results from the balance between stochastic driving forces and opposing material forces. Due to a possible non-thermal origin of stochastic forces in living cells, in general, a combination of passive and active microrheology experiments is required to quantify the material properties of the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mizuno et al., 2007</a>). However, active microrheology experiments in yeast are challenging, because of its small size and stiff outer cell wall. Nonetheless, a detailed analysis of particle trajectories in the passive microrheology approach provides first pointers towards changes in the physical properties of the cytoplasm. One example is the power spectral density (PSD) of particle displacements, which is related to the power spectrum of stochastic forces and the material properties (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 2014</a>). The PSD can be calculated as a Fourier transform of the MSD and can, for our data in all conditions, be well approximated by a power law dependence <math id=\"inf5\"><mi>P</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>\u221d</mo><msup><mi>\u03c9</mi><mrow><mo>\u2212</mo><mi>\u03b3</mi></mrow></msup></math> (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We find that the exponent <math id=\"inf6\"><mi>\u03b3</mi></math> is smaller for acidified and energy-depleted cells. For a viscoelastic material driven by thermal fluctuations, a decrease in <math id=\"inf7\"><mi>\u03b3</mi></math> would correspond to a transition from a fluid to a more solid-like state (<a href=\"#bib72\">Squires and Mason, 2010</a>). Although we demonstrate that active cytoskeleton-dependent forces do not strongly affect mobility of particles, and we expect no active motion to occur in energy-depleted cells, the thermal nature of driving forces remains an assumption and therefore limits our interpretation of the PSD data. To obtain further insight into particle diffusion, we turn to the analysis of the displacement data on the level of individual trajectories and suggest a statistical model for the observed particle motion."

In contrast to ordinary Brownian motion, the displacements in fBm are correlated in time. Positively correlated displacements lead to superdiffusion, whereas negative correlations lead to subdiffusion. As for ordinary Brownian motion, the distribution of displacements of individual particles performing subdiffusive fBm is Gaussian, but the width of the distribution increases with the lag time sub-linearly <math id=\"inf42\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c3</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><msup><mrow></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>d</mi><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><msup><mi>t</mi><mtext>\u03b1</mtext></msup></mrow></math> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hofling and Franosch, 2013</a>).

The subscripts <math id=\"inf46\"><mi>i</mi></math> indicate the diffusivities of individual particle trajectories. We show that our displacement data are consistent with the model of fBm: For sufficiently long individual trajectories, the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of displacements are well described by CDFs of the corresponding Gaussian distributions (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Also consistent with the model of fBm, the combined (ensemble) distributions of all particle displacements measured for different lag times collapse onto each other after rescaling the displacements as <math id=\"inf47\"><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>/</mo><msup><mi>t</mi><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The value of <math id=\"inf48\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math> is read out from the scaling of the MSD for the corresponding experimental condition (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Remarkably, the shape of this distribution is not Gaussian. However, if we additionally rescale the displacements of each trajectory by its corresponding generalized diffusivity <math id=\"inf49\"><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>, the combined distributions collapse onto a Gaussian distribution with unit variance (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This collapse shows that the non-Gaussian shape of the combined distribution is a result of the variation in individual particle diffusivities (see materials and methods for details). The variability of generalized diffusivities could be due to differences in particle sizes, but it could also reflect variations in the properties of the particles\u2019 microenvironments. Indeed, we find that even for particles of similar sizes the diffusivities vary strongly for all size groups (see <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that the heterogeneity of the particle microenvironment has a strong impact on particle mobility."

Negative displacement correlations are the origin of subdiffusive fBm. Indeed, we found that subsequent particle displacements were negatively correlated (see <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and material and methods for the definition of the correlation function). Interestingly, such negative correlations are a hallmark of particle motion in an elastic environment; particles surrounded by elastic structures tend to be pushed back to their original position. The further the particle is initially displaced, the stronger are the forces pushing it back in the subsequent time interval, which results in stronger negative correlations. Indeed, we find on average that the restoring motion is opposite to the initial step and is linearly proportional to the initial displacement length (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In general, the slope of this linear dependence changes from 0 for viscous fluid to -1/2 for an elastic material (<a href=\"#bib84\">Weeks and Weitz, 2002</a>). In our data, the magnitude of the slope <i>b</i> increases from <math id=\"inf50\"><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2248</mo><mn>0.15</mn></mrow></math> to <math id=\"inf51\"><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2248</mo><mn>0.34</mn></mrow></math> upon energy depletion and acidification (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>).

To experimentally address this question, we mechanically phenotyped budding yeast cells. This required enzymatic removal of the rigid cell wall, which provides mechanical stability to yeast cells, by a process known as spheroplasting. Spheroplasted budding yeast cells were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM, [<a href=\"#bib60\">Radmacher, 2007</a>]), the standard in cell mechanical characterization, and real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC, [<a href=\"#bib54\">Otto et al., 2015</a>]), a novel microfluidic technique with 100000 times higher throughput. The AFM-based indentation experiments, performed with 10 \u00b5m-sized spherical probes to test whole cell mechanics, revealed that acidified cells were about 2.5 times as stiff as control cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, the apparent elastic modulus we measured for spheroplasted cells was three orders of magnitude lower than for yeast cells surrounded by a cell wall (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), thus clearly showing that the cell wall had been completely removed. However, cells are usually viscoelastic, and the apparent elastic modulus, as extracted using the Hertz model, reflects their combined elastic and viscous response. To test whether the observed 2.5-fold increase in the apparent elastic modulus of spheroplasts at low pH could also be caused by a strong increase in the viscous resistance to deformation, we extracted the viscosity of the cells from the AFM indentation-retraction curves similar to a recently published method (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rebelo et al., 2013</a>; for details see Methods section). We found that the viscosity even decreased from pH 7.4 to pH 6.0 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Together, the analysis of apparent elastic modulus and viscosity unambiguously demonstrates that the cell body transitions from a compliant, more viscous material to a stiffer, more elastic material at low pH."

                                "text": "To investigate which scenario might apply, we performed a series of experiments with budding and fission yeast. First, we determined the volume of budding yeast cells using an image-based approach (see materials and methods for details). We found that the cell volume was reduced in a pH-dependent manner. After 30 min at pH 5.5, the cell volume was reduced by ~7% (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Cell volume changes can also be induced by altering the osmotic strength of the growth medium with sorbitol (<a href=\"#bib44\">Miermont et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we exposed yeast to different sorbitol concentrations to determine the concentration at which the cell volume was similar to that of acidified yeast. We found that at a sorbitol concentration of 0.8\u2009M the cell volume decrease was of the same magnitude (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). As a next step, we compared the particle mobility of osmotically compressed and acidified yeast showing a similar decrease in cell volume. We found that under both conditions particle motion was strongly reduced (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). However, in osmotically compressed cells particles of all sizes still performed small movements. These movements could also be detected when yeast cells were exposed to a sorbitol concentration of 1\u2009M, which triggers an even more pronounced cell volume reduction of ~30%. In contrast, particle motion was abolished in acidified yeast (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This suggests that a regulatory cell volume decrease cannot fully explain the reduced particle dynamics of acidified yeast. To further investigate this, we compared the diffusivity of a mCherry-GFP fusion protein (54\u2009kDa) in energy-depleted, acidified and sorbitol-treated cells. The diffusion of mCherry-GFP was not affected in acidified or energy-depleted yeast (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), but strongly decreased in cells subjected to high levels of osmotic compression. This indicates the presence of a fluid phase that allows unimpaired diffusion of small macromolecules such as mCherry-GFP in cells exposed to low pH or energy depletion conditions. Thus, cytosolic acidification and osmotic compression seem to induce qualitatively different states of the cytoplasm."

However, when the cell wall is removed, fission yeast cells rapidly round up into a spherical shape (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kelly and Nurse, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sipiczki et al., 1985</a>). This process requires the cytoplasm to be in a fluid-like state, and it is most likely driven by the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm and by the passive tendency of the cell to minimize its surface to volume ratio. Remarkably, when we spheroplasted energy-depleted yeast cells, they did not relax into spheres, but maintained their initial rod-like shape (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). This effect was not due to incomplete removal of the cell wall (<a href=\"#fig5s6\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s7\">7</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s8\">8</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Importantly, for wall-free cells, maintenance of the rod-like shape was pH-dependent and could also be induced by reducing the cytosolic pH\u00a0with DNP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>)."

However, the spheroplasts maintained their elongated shape for several hours and did not show signs of rounding up (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>). Given this remarkable cellular phenotype, we tested whether the cells are still alive and get softer when energy is provided and the internal pH rebounds to neutral values. Indeed, when acidified yeast cells were re-exposed to medium, the cells quickly became spherical and started to enter the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig5s9\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 9</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). Importantly, this rounding up process occurred in the presence of 1\u2009M sorbitol, which was used to osmotically stabilize the cells. Under these conditions, yeast cells experience a substantial reduction in cell volume (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that an increase in molecular crowding alone does not generate enough mechanical stability to keep the cells in a rod-like shape. Rather, these findings support our idea that cellular stiffening may involve the formation of rigid cytoplasmic structures, which dissolve when energy-depleted yeast re-adjust their cytosolic pH to neutral values. Thus, we conclude that the cytoplasm of energy-depleted cells undergoes a pH-dependent transition from a fluid- to a solid-like state, which may be accompanied by the formation of structures that significantly increase the mechanical stability of cells."

A large number of in vitro studies have shown that the solubility of proteins drops precipitously, when the pH of the solution approaches their isoelectric points (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tanford and De, 1961</a>). Under these conditions, proteins interact with each other to form higher-order assemblies, which macroscopically manifest as structures with solid-like properties (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boye et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Matsudomi et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Parker et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Renard and Lefebvre, 1992</a>).

In agreement with previous work (<a href=\"#bib85\">Weiller et al., 2004</a>), we found that the isoelectric points of yeast proteins are largely excluded from the neutral pH range and cluster into two peaks, one in the acidic and one in the basic range (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Importantly, the acidic peak overlaps with the pH that cells experience under starvation conditions. This suggests that many proteins have a reduced net charge in energy-depleted cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chan et al., 2006</a>) and thus become less soluble. This is in agreement with previous results, where it was shown that starvation triggers the assembly of many proteins into higher-order structures (<a href=\"#bib47\">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Noree et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Petrovska et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, protein complexes remain intact in energy-depleted cells, as shown by the fact that the different proteins in a hetero-complex colocalize in the same structures (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that the proteins assemble into structures in a native-like state, ensuring that this step is readily reversible. To investigate whether protein assembly and reduced particle mobility are temporally linked, we exposed yeast cells to pH manipulations in a microfluidic chamber and followed assembly and particle movement by fluorescence microscopy. Indeed, we found that these two events coincided (<a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>), suggesting a causal relationship."

To investigate this possibility, we tested a set of 70 proteins that had previously been shown to assemble into higher-order structures upon starvation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Noree et al., 2010</a>). We found that the majority of these proteins formed structures upon acidification, whereas such structures were less abundant or absent at neutral pH (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and C</a>) or in 1\u2009M sorbitol (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Similar structures were observed in dormant yeast spores (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), which reportedly have a pH in the acidic range (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aon and Cortassa, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barton et al., 1980</a>).

Thus, changes in the physical or chemical properties of the cytoplasm will have far-reaching consequences for cellular metabolism and survival. Here, we demonstrate that adaptive changes in the cytosolic pH alter the material properties of the cytoplasm and arrest the diffusion of cellular organelles and foreign tracer particles (see schematic in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). We further show that pH-controlled macromolecular assembly drives a transition of the cytoplasm to a solid-like state, which provides protection and increased mechanical stability."

In eukaryotic cells, ATP-driven motor proteins carry organelles and other cargo along cytoskeletal tracks to specific subcellular locations, thus regulating the distribution of cytoplasmic components (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hirokawa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Roberts et al., 2013</a>). Recent findings also indicate that the movements of motor proteins generate random fluctuating forces, which drive diffusive-like non-thermal motion (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brangwynne et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 2014</a>). These non-thermal force fluctuations facilitate the mixing of the cytoplasm and thus are important for cellular function. As a consequence, energy depletion in mammalian cells causes a cessation of motor movements and thus a strong impairment of intracellular motion, with a significant impact on the distribution of macromolecules in the cytoplasm."

Studies so far have largely focused on the driving forces of particle motion, and most prominently those that are dependent on ATP (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brangwynne et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Parry et al., 2014</a>). However, we now show that changes in the material properties of the cytoplasm can also significantly affect particle motion. These changes occur in an energy-dependent manner, indicating that energy not only regulates motor-driven diffusive processes, but also has an impact on the organization of the cytoplasm. In the organisms we investigate, these changes are largely independent of the cytoskeleton, but reflect the collective effects of many cytosolic proteins that assemble into higher-order structures."

For example, it is a well-known fact that changes in the salt concentration can have a strong impact on protein solubility. One parameter with particularly strong effects on protein solubility is the pH. When the pH of a solution approaches a protein\u2019s isoelectric point, the solubility of the protein drops to a minimum (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tanford and De, 1961</a>). The reason is that under these conditions proteins attain a low net charge and thus are subject to weaker repulsive interactions. As a consequence, attractive interactions dominate, which\u2014provided that the protein is present at a high enough concentration\u2014can trigger the assembly of proteins into higher-order structures."

Thus, on the macroscopic level, protein assembly can exhibit signs of a phase transition. Although this tendency of proteins to form higher-order structures is well known, this knowledge has not yet been applied to the understanding of living organisms. One reason may be the widespread but misleading assumption that the physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm are invariant. However, in recent years, an increasing number of reports have shown that key physical and chemical parameters of the cytoplasm can fluctuate, especially under conditions of stress. In the case of cytosolic proton concentrations, these fluctuations can span almost two orders of magnitude (our study and <a href=\"#bib33\">Imai and Ohno, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Orij et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Valli et al., 2005</a>). Given that the cytoplasm is highly crowded with proteins, it is not surprising that pH changes of this scale have strong effects on the physical properties and the dynamics of the cytoplasm."

These studies found that only few proteins have isoelectric points in the neutral pH range and that most proteins only become electrically neutral when the pH shifts to the acidic or basic range. Importantly, proteins become more insoluble when their net charge decreases. Thus, to maintain maximum proteome solubility, cells have to keep the cytosolic pH in the neutral range. However, when the pH of the cytosol becomes more acidic, as during starvation, a large fraction of the proteome will become less soluble. Consistent with this, we could previously show that cytosolic acidification triggers the assembly of a group of metabolic enzymes into higher-order structures and that assembly inactivates their enzymatic activities (<a href=\"#bib57\">Petrovska et al., 2014</a>). Here, we provide evidence that many more proteins assemble into microscopically visible structures upon acidification (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and C</a>), and we propose that assembly of these and probably many other proteins promotes a transition of the cytoplasm to a more solid-like state. Importantly, pH-dependent assembly of proteins does not seem to go along with protein denaturation, as the proteins in these assemblies retain their native structure (<a href=\"#bib57\">Petrovska et al., 2014</a>) and oligomeric states (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This ensures that assembly formation can readily be reversed and that the cytoplasm can rapidly recover from pH-induced alterations, thus allowing swift reentry into the cell cycle. Most importantly, protein assembly and the solid-like state of the cytoplasm protect cells from the adverse effects of energy depletion stress (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We do not yet know why these processes are protective, but we favor a combination of different explanations, such as energy conservation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>), regulation of metabolism (<a href=\"#bib57\">Petrovska et al., 2014</a>), and potentially protection of macromolecules from damage."

Although we do not determine the water content of energy-depleted and acidified cells, we find that acidification goes along with a significant reduction of the cellular volume, which is consistent with a loss of water. Previous studies have shown that protein assembly leads to the exclusion of water (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cameron et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cameron and Fullerton, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fullerton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Thirumalai et al., 2012</a>). The released water becomes osmotically available and can be lost to the surrounding environment, inducing a compaction of the cytoplasm and a change in cell volume. Thus, we propose that the observed cellular shrinkage is to a large degree caused by the formation of cytoplasmic structures and a subsequent release of water."

The authors of this study found that the cytoplasm of mammalian cells behaves like a hydrogel, which can swell and shrink depending on its water content. Importantly, changes in the cytosolic pH could modulate swelling and shrinking (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fels et al., 2009</a>). This suggests that the cytoplasm with its many macromolecular components is inherently pH sensitive, a property, which may have been exploited repeatedly during evolution as a strategy for adaptation or survival. In fact, the germination of spores goes along with a drastic increase in water content (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cowan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dijksterhuis et al., 2007</a>) and spores consistently have a pH in the acidic range (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aon and Cortassa, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barton et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Busa and Crowe, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Setlow and Setlow, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">van Beilen and Brul, 2013</a>). However, what is still unclear is how water is released from forming spores and re-enters into spores upon germination. Given our findings, we propose that the dehydration/rehydration cycle of spores is at least partially driven by changes in the cytosolic pH. A regulatory cell volume decrease with increased macromolecular crowding may also contribute to the water loss in dormant cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mour\u00e3o et al., 2014</a>). Dissection of this important problem will require the use of sophisticated biophysical, biochemical, and genetic approaches."

This transition was evident for the cytoplasm (as determined by particle tracking) and on the level of the entire cell (as determined by cellular deformability assays). This is, to our knowledge, the first viscous and elastic characterization of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> spheroplasts by AFM-indentation. The elastic modulus (on the order of 1 kPa) is several orders of magnitude lower than what has been reported for intact yeast cells surrounded by a rigid cell wall (about 500 kPa; [<a href=\"#bib58\">Pillet et al., 2014</a>]). A similar difference in stiffness between spheroplasts and intact cells with a rigid cell wall has previously been found in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sullivan et al., 2007</a>). The increased mechanical stiffness at low pH was independently confirmed by a new microfluidic technique (RT-DC). The transition from a compliant, more viscous cytoplasm to a stiff, elastic cytoplasm in energy-depleted yeast cells is in agreement with a model in which many proteins assemble into a dense network, thus restricting the diffusion of large particles. This network could have the overall physical properties of a glass, as recently proposed for bacteria (<a href=\"#bib56\">Parry et al., 2014</a>). Future studies will have to determine the molecular mechanisms and physical causes promoting the formation of a solid-like cytoplasm."

However, this also means that yeast cells have to alter the material properties of the cytoplasm to restrict diffusion during dormancy. We believe this is achieved by promoting a pH-controlled transition to a solid-like state, which significantly changes the fluidity of the cytoplasm. Acidification of the cellular interior of yeast seems to occur through an influx of protons from the outside, suggesting that this transition is dependent on an acidic environment, which may be generated through the normal metabolic activity of yeast. Thus, we predict that single-celled organisms make extensive use of the pH responsiveness of the cytoplasm in order to protect themselves and regulate their metabolism. However, even multicellular organisms such as marine brine shrimp can enter into a dormant state in a pH-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib10\">Busa and Crowe, 1983</a>). Importantly, in this organism dormancy is induced through protons that are released from intracellular stores (<a href=\"#bib14\">Covi et al., 2005</a>), indicating that dependence on outside pH could be a peculiarity of yeast. Moreover, cytosolic pH changes have also been observed when organisms such as yeast and <i>Dictyostelium</i> are challenged with other types of stresses, such as heat stress or osmotic stress (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pintsch et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Weitzel et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">1987</a>). Thus, global control over the material properties of the cytoplasm through simple physicochemical signals such as the pH could be a frequently used means to regulate cellular function in fluctuating environments."

Tip-less silicone cantilevers (Arrow-TL1, Nanoworld, Switzerland) were equipped with a polystyrene bead of 10 \u00b5m diameter (microParticles GmbH, Germany) and calibrated prior to measurements using the thermal noise method. Cell-Tak (Corning, USA) was used for immobilization of spheroplasts (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gautier et al., 2015</a>). To determine the stiffness of single spheroplasts (<i>S. cerevisiae)</i>, the cantilever was positioned above individual cells and lowered with a speed of 10 \u00b5m/s. Force-distance curves were recorded (maximum force 2 nN) and analyzed using the JPK data processing software (JPK instruments): Force-distance data were corrected for the tip-sample separation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Radmacher, 2007</a>) and fitted with the Hertz model for a spherical indenter (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sneddon, 1965</a>). An effective probe radius was used according to the Hertz model for two spheres. A Poisson ratio of 0.5 was assumed. Experiments were carried out in phosphate buffer (containing 1\u2009M sorbitol and 1% glucose) adjusted to pH 6.0 or pH 7.4 at room temperature both with and without DNP (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements</a>). Reporting an <i>apparent</i> elastic (Young\u2019s) modulus acknowledges the fact that several assumptions of the Hertz model (isotropic, homogeneous, semi-infinite space) are not met; but this still serves well for quantitative comparison of cells in different pH conditions. The Hertz model also assumes an elastic material, but cells are viscoelastic and an observed increase in apparent elastic modulus could also be caused by an increase in viscous resistance to deformation. To directly determine the viscosity <i>\u03b7</i> of spheroplasted cells from the recorded force-distance data, we adapted a method proposed by (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rebelo et al., 2013</a>). Briefly, this method extracts the viscosity <i>\u03b7</i> by comparing the dissipated energy during the indentation process, <i>W</i><sub>diss</sub>, to the viscous work, <i>W</i><sub>v</sub>, which is modeled taking into account the indenter shape and indenter velocity. <i>W</i><sub>diss</sub> corresponds to the area between the approach and retract force-distance curves, <math id=\"inf52\"><msub><mi>W</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>\u222b</mo><mn>0</mn><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></msubsup><mrow><mo>(</mo><msup><mi>F</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>a</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></msup><mo>\u2212</mo><msup><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msup><mo>)</mo></mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>\u03b4</mi></math>, where <i>\u03b4</i> is the tip-sample-separation, or indentation, and the superscripts <i>app</i> and <i>ret</i> indicate the forces recorded during approach and retraction, respectively.

Here, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> spheroplasts were resuspended in PBS-methylcellulose medium adjusted to different pH, containing 1\u2009M sorbitol and 1% glucose. Cells were drawn into a 1\u2009ml syringe and connected to polymer tubing, which had been cleaned using 70% ethanol and 200 nm sterile-filtered (Sigma Aldrich) deionized water. After connecting tubing to the syringe pump and microfluidic chip a flow was stabilized for 1 min. Here, measurements were carried out at a constant flow rate of 0.012\u2009\u03bcl/s. For reference, data are also acquired inside the reservoirs to ensure no deformed cell shape in the absence of mechanical stress (data not shown)."

Cytoplasmic acidification appears sufficient to reduce the motion of large tracer particles.

The authors propose that particle confinement under starvation is caused by the cytoplasm transitioning from a solution to a gel-like state. The topic is important and has large implications to our understanding of cellular dynamics and dormancy in eukaryotes. While the results are potentially exciting, there are major concerns with some interpretations and conclusions."

If <i>S. pombe</i> cells do indeed maintain their rod shape at low pH even after their cell wall has been removed, it would be an absolutely amazing result. This increases the burden of proof. An alternative and trivial explanation for the result is that the cells still have residual cell wall that contributes to the rod shape maintenance and stiffness of the cell. Perhaps enzymatic digestion of the cell wall is incomplete at low pH, which would not be surprising. To me, the maintenance of the rod shape actually argues that wall-free cells were not generated, casting doubt on the claim of increased stiffness. Complete removal of cell wall must be ascertained. Perhaps (round) spheroplasts could first be generated at neutral pH, and then re-shaped (e.g., to rod-like) by an external force (e.g., their pressure-based microfluidic device might do the trick). The authors could then test whether the new (non-round) shape is maintained after a switch to low pH even when the external force is relieved."

This is a good thing to do if there are truly fundamental characteristics shared between the two analogs. In the SGR case, great care was taken to show the analogy. Other examples in cell mechanics have been published to show in detail the analogy between cellular dynamics and some inanimate physical systems. In the submitted manuscript such a level of care is not taken, and the term \"freezing\" is used without any thought about what are the essential phenomena of freezing, and whether this gelation is anything like true freezing. If the authors believe that what they observe is truly a sol-gel transition associated with assembly of macromolecules in the cytoplasm, they should name the phenomenon accordingly. Their work will be taken more seriously by a broader audience if they let go of this name."

This assumption allows connecting MSDs to material properties. A decent argument is made for this by showing that the depolymerization of actin and microtubules has little effect on their results. I do not know whether this argument is legitimate. Is it really true that no other non-equilibrium or biochemical driving forces can occur in the cytoplasm, other than those driven by the action of ATP on filament bound motors? The work by McIntosh and Schmidt from a few years ago sidestepped this question by comparing active microrheology (manually driven beads with E or B fields) to passive microrheology, and carefully measuring a driving spectrum. The recent paper by Guo and Weitz did something similar. I think this sort of thing would have to be done again here, and the outcome would have to show that the spectrum is indeed thermal, then a thermal analysis could be performed to link MSD to material properties."

They can just say that the MSDs say things are more \"liquid-like\" or \"solid-like\", and then focus on the general phenomena like the dramatic reduction in motion. The supplementary movies show this beautifully. Several years ago many high-profile papers were published that flippantly linked particle MSDs to material properties, which ultimately damaged the reputations of the authors. I think it is imperative that care is taken to prevent the same thing from occurring, for the sake of the authors and the broader research community."

They would also have to show that this could not be attributed to membrane tension, since a balloon filled with water will seem like a solid when indented from the outside.

But if they want to show this, the authors should validate that this does not reflect localization error (imperfect localization of a static object will always give this correlation plot). The time scale of the negative correlation should be robust over experiments of different frame rates.

(2010) paper talks about a wide genetic screen identifying metabolic proteins that form 4 distinct filaments, with some being induced by energy depletion, but others being unaffected or even reduced upon energy depletion. The Narayanaswamy et al. (2009) paper and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> here show mostly puncta forming, but puncta (compact aggregates) do not form gels.

Perhaps enzymatic digestion of the cell wall is incomplete at low pH, which would not be surprising. To me, the maintenance of the rod shape actually argues that wall-free cells were not generated, casting doubt on the claim of increased stiffness. Complete removal of cell wall must be ascertained. Perhaps (round) spheroplasts could first be generated at neutral pH, and then re-shaped (e.g., to rod-like) by an external force (e.g., their pressure-based microfluidic device might do the trick). The authors could then test whether the new (non-round) shape is maintained after a switch to low pH even when the external force is relieved. Similarly, the authors need to rule out that the increased stiffness observed in energy-depleted/acidified budding yeast cells is not due to the presence of residual cell wall. Stiffness measurements could be performed on spheroplasts created under normal (log phase, neutral pH conditions when the cell wall is known to be completely digested) and then switched to energy-depleted or acidic conditions for stiffness measurements.</i> "

We therefore assume that energy depletion causes a passive adjustment of the cytosolic pH to the pH of the external medium, as also observed by us in budding yeast. This is in agreement with previous observations that <i>Dictyostelium</i> and <i>S. pombe</i> undergo cytosolic pH fluctuations of a similar magnitude (Gross et al., 1983; Karagiannis and Young, 2001). Furthermore, these organisms preferably live in acidic environments and presumably spend a lot of energy to maintain their cytosolic pH via ATP-dependent proton pumps. Unfortunately, our molecular understanding of these organisms is very limited, and further work is required to learn more about the link between energy depletion and cytosolic pH. However, we would like to point out that acidification through outside protons may not be the only mechanism of acidifying the cytosol. In fact, a previous paper, which reported intracellular pH fluctuations in dormant marine brine shrimp, implicated intracellular stores as proton source (Covi et al., 2005).

We consistently saw a difference between the first condition and the latter two conditions, and we can only speculate about the causes. First, both treatments slightly change the cytosolic pH and may also change the concentrations of other ions, which could already have an effect on particle mobility. Second, DNP equilibrates proton gradients over all membranes in the cell. It may therefore perturb the proton gradient over the inner mitochondrial membrane (this is what DNP is normally used for), thus inhibiting mitochondrial ATP production. Thus, cells treated with DNP or low amounts of sorbic acid could already experience some form of energy depletion, which could lead to the partial reduction in MSD that we observe.

Is it really true that no other non-equilibrium or biochemical driving forces can occur in the cytoplasm, other than those driven by the action of ATP on filament bound motors?

There is not only no 2.5-fold increase in viscosity, which could otherwise account for the increase in apparent elastic modulus previously reported, the viscosity is actually decreasing. This also means that the actual elastic modulus increases by more than a factor of 2.5 from pH 7.4 to pH 6.0."

We are hesitant to report these phase angle values in the manuscript, as they contain very crude assumptions. However, the reduction in viscosity, together with the increase in elasticity necessitates a reduction in phase angle and clearly demonstrates that the cells transition from a compliant, more viscous material to a stiffer, more elastic material at lower pH. We have added this new additional analysis to the main manuscript, which now further strengthens our main message."

However, it is unlikely that all of the increase in stiffness comes from an increase in membrane tension. In fact, other evidence presented in the manuscript suggests a strong contribution from intracellular elastic elements, as evident by the strong increase in elasticity, which we extract from the SPT experiments inside the cytoplasm, and the lack of rounding-up of yeast cells at pH 6.0, when the cell wall is removed (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and 5D</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). In fact, higher membrane tension at low pH should lead to faster rounding up, and not a lack of rounding up. Furthermore, we observed that the cell volume decreases under low pH conditions, which should, if anything, lead to more available membrane and lower membrane tension in acidified yeast. The emerging picture, consistent with all available evidence, is thus more of a balloon filled with a fluid at pH 7.4 and an elastic bulk material at pH 6.0 with membrane tension changes playing a minor role."

First the standard displacement correlation function as a function of the lag time is calculated, and it shows negative correlations (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Next, we look at the strength of correlations between two consecutive steps. For that we calculate the average projection of the second step on the direction of the initial step and plot it as a function of the initial displacement length (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). This allows us to test if a large initial fluctuation in a particle\u2019s position is followed by a proportionally larger displacement in the opposing direction at the next instant of time. The (negative) slope of the linear dependence connecting the strength of negative correlation to the length of the initial step varies from 0 (viscous material) to -1/2 (elastic material). For our data we can see that the negative slopes larger in magnitude correspond to energy-depleted or acidified cells. We also make sure that this result does not change, if we vary the lag time for which the displacements are calculated."

We provide such a plot below and show that the negative correlations do not disappear even for very long lag times.
