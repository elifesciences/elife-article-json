While previous pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated promising proofs-of-concept (Serruya et al., 2002; Simeral et al., 2011; Bacher et al., 2015; Nuyujukian et al., 2015; Aflalo et al., 2015; Gilja et al., 2015; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015; Wolpaw et al., 1998; Hwang et al., 2012; Sp\u00fcler et al., 2012; Leuthardt et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2002; Schalk et al., 2008; Moran, 2010; Brunner et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Townsend and Platsko, 2016; Vansteensel et al., 2016; Nuyujukian et al., 2016; Carmena et al., 2003; Musallam et al., 2004; Santhanam et al., 2006; Hochberg et al., 2006; Ganguly et al., 2011; O\u2019Doherty et al., 2011; Gilja et al., 2012), the performance of human clinical BCI systems is not yet high enough to support widespread adoption by people with physical limitations of speech. Here we report a high-performance intracortical BCI (iBCI) for communication, which was tested by three clinical trial participants with paralysis. The system leveraged advances in decoder design developed in prior pre-clinical and clinical studies (Gilja et al., 2015; Kao et al., 2016; Gilja et al., 2012). For all three participants, performance exceeded previous iBCIs (Bacher et al., 2015; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015) as measured by typing rate (by a factor of 1.4\u20134.2) and information throughput (by a factor of 2.2\u20134.0). This high level of performance demonstrates the potential utility of iBCIs as powerful assistive communication devices for people with limited motor function."

While previous pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated promising proofs-of-concept (Serruya et al., 2002; Simeral et al., 2011; Bacher et al., 2015; Nuyujukian et al., 2015; Aflalo et al., 2015; Gilja et al., 2015; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015; Wolpaw et al., 1998; Hwang et al., 2012; Sp\u00fcler et al., 2012; Leuthardt et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2002; Schalk et al., 2008; Moran, 2010; Brunner et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Townsend and Platsko, 2016; Vansteensel et al., 2016; Nuyujukian et al., 2016; Carmena et al., 2003; Musallam et al., 2004; Santhanam et al., 2006; Hochberg et al., 2006; Ganguly et al., 2011; O\u2019Doherty et al., 2011; Gilja et al., 2012), the performance of human clinical BCI systems is not yet high enough to support widespread adoption by people with physical limitations of speech. Here we report a high-performance intracortical BCI (iBCI) for communication, which was tested by three clinical trial participants with paralysis. The system leveraged advances in decoder design developed in prior pre-clinical and clinical studies (Gilja et al., 2015; Kao et al., 2016; Gilja et al., 2012). For all three participants, performance exceeded previous iBCIs (Bacher et al., 2015; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015) as measured by typing rate (by a factor of 1.4\u20134.2) and information throughput (by a factor of 2.2\u20134.0). This high level of performance demonstrates the potential utility of iBCIs as powerful assistive communication devices for people with limited motor function."

However, the ability to communicate is often limited by conditions such as stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or other injuries or neurologic disorders which can cause paralysis by damaging the neural pathways that connect the brain to the rest of the body. BCIs offer a potential solution to restore communication by harnessing intact neural signals. Many candidate BCIs have been developed for this purpose, including those based on electroencephalography (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wolpaw et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hwang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sp\u00fcler et al., 2012</a>), electrocorticography (<a href=\"#bib32\">Leuthardt et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schalk et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Moran, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brunner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2013</a>), and intracortical electrical signals (<a href=\"#bib53\">Serruya et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Taylor et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carmena et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Musallam et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Santhanam et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hochberg et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ganguly et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">O\u2019Doherty et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gilja et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Simeral et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bacher et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nuyujukian et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aflalo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gilja et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jarosiewicz et al., 2015</a>).

In this example, the participant typed 255 characters in\u00a0~9 min, at just over 27 correct characters per minute. One of two audible \u2018beeps\u2019 followed a target selection, corresponding to the two possible selection methods: T6 could select targets using either the Hidden Markov Model-based \u2018click\u2019 selection (high-pitched noises) or by \u2018dwelling\u2019 in the target region for 1 s (low-pitched noises). The plot at the bottom of the video tracks the typing performance (correct characters per minute) with respect to time in the block. Performance was smoothed using a 30 s symmetric Hamming window. The scrolling yellow bar indicates the current time of that frame. During the free typing task, T6 was asked to suppress her hand movements as best as possible. (During the quantitative performance evaluations, T6 was free to make movements as she wished.) This video is from participant T6, Day 621, Block 17. Additional \u2018free typing\u2019 examples for T6 are detailed in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">2</a>."

However, in the human-computer interface literature, typing speeds are measured conventionally not in a free typing task, but rather using a \u2018copy typing\u2019 assessment, in which a subject is asked to type pre-determined phrases (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib34\">MacKenzie and Soukoreff, 2002</a>). We performed such copy typing assessments with three participants, T6, T5 (a man, 63 years old, with tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury), and T7 (a man, 54 years old, also diagnosed with ALS). Each research session followed a rigorous protocol that aimed to measure peak performance rather than robustness (detailed in Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods: Quantitative performance evaluation and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>). Participants were asked to type one of seven sentences (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), which were prompted on the screen. Performance was quantified by the number of correct characters typed within each two-minute evaluation block. T6 and T5\u2019s performance were assessed using the OPTI-II layout described above as well as a conventional QWERTY layout (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,b</a>). For participant T7, who had minimal previous typing experience, the QWERTY keyboard was replaced by an alternative layout (ABCDEF; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>), which had the same geometry but with letters arranged in alphabetical order. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a> shows examples of prompted and typed text for each participant. We performed five days of testing with T6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>; 21 typing evaluation blocks for each keyboard), two days of testing with T5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>; 14 typing evaluation blocks for each keyboard), and two days of testing with T7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>; 5\u20136 typing blocks for each keyboard). Example videos that demonstrate cued typing for all participants are included as <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media7\">7</a>. T6's average performance using the QWERTY keyboard was 23.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.5 correct characters per minute (ccpm; mean \u00b1 s.d.). T6's average performance using the OPTI-II keyboard was 31.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7 ccpm, 1.3 times faster than her performance with the QWERTY layout. Participant T5 averaged 36.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 and 39.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 ccpm for the QWERTY and OPTI-II keyboards, respectively. Participant T7 averaged 13.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9 and 12.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9 ccpm for the ABCDEF and OPTI-II keyboards, respectively. These results represent a 3.4x (T6, OPTI-II), 4.2x (T5, OPTI-II), and 1.4x (T7, ABCDEF) increase over the previous highest performing BCI report that did not include word completion (9.4 ccpm [<a href=\"#bib3\">Bacher et al., 2015</a>]; p&lt;0.01 for all three participants, single-sided Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> tests). Further additions of word completion or prediction should only increase the effective typing rates."

T5 and T7\u2019s protocols were very similar. T6 started with a glove-controlled movement calibration block (112 trials, 100 pixel target diameter, 750 ms hold time). T5 and T7 did not use data s, and instead that calibration block was substituted for a block where the cursor moved automatically while they attempted to move along with the cursor (\u2018open-loop\u2019 calibration). This was followed by HMM click decoder calibration for T6. This was omitted for T7 as no HMM was used for sessions with him, but the cursor decoder was recalibrated at this stage. T5 did not need this either, as the HMM was trained on the same block as the cursor movement decoder. If the output of these two calibration steps resulted in a controllable cursor, then the data blocksets were started. Here, the decoders were recalibrated again based on a closed-loop control block, and data was collected under a strict timing protocol (see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Blocksets were repeated as possible, at the discretion of the participant. Once a blockset was started for a particular research session, starting over with initial calibration was prohibited."

To explicitly quantify the information throughput of the BCI itself (independent of a phrase or keyboard layout), performance was also measured using a cued-target acquisition task (\u2018grid task' [<a href=\"#bib23\">Hochberg et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nuyujukian et al., 2015</a>]), in which square targets were arranged in a 6 \u00d7 6 grid, and a randomly selected target was cued on each trial. Performance was quantified using \u2018achieved bitrate\u2019 (detailed in <a href=\"#bib42\">Nuyujukian et al. (2015)</a> and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods: Achieved bitrate), which is a conservative measure used to quantify the total amount of information conveyed by the BCI. Briefly, the number of bits transmitted is the net number of correct \u2018symbols\u2019 multiplied by log2(N - 1), where N is the total number of targets. The net number of correct symbols is taken as the total number of correct selections minus the total number of incorrect selections, i.e., each incorrect selection requires an additional correct selection to compensate (analogous to having to select a keyboard\u2019s backspace key). For example, on an eight-target task, if the net rate of correct target selections (after compensating for incorrect selections) were one target / s, the achieved bitrate would be 2.8 bits / s."

(2015)</a>; p&lt;0.01 for both participants, single-sided Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> tests). For T6 and T7, who participated in the previous study, performance of the current methods represents a factor of 2.4 (T6) and 2.2 (T7) increase. For T5, the current performance represents a factor of 4.0 increase over the highest performing participant in the previous study. (The previous study measured performance using a free typing task, which includes the cognitive load of word formation [<a href=\"#bib27\">Jarosiewicz et al., 2015</a>]. However, the effects of cognitive load in the current study (i.e., comparing T6\u2019s free typing vs. copy typing) only accounted for a\u00a0~30% performance difference, rather than the 2\u20134x performance difference between studies. Thus, cognitive load is unlikely to account for the differences in performance.) The performance increase over previous work is unlikely to be due to experience with BCI, as participants in the current study had a similar range of experience using the BCI as those in comparable studies (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Example videos that demonstrate the grid task for all participants are included as <a href=\"#media8\">Videos 8</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media11\">11</a>. In addition, comparisons of the HMM\u2019s performance against the previous highest-performing approach for discrete selection are presented in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. We performed additional grid measurements with T5 in which targets were arranged in a denser grid (9 \u00d7 9). This task allows the possibility for higher bitrates than the 6 \u00d7 6 grid used above, with the tradeoff that selecting these smaller targets requires higher control fidelity. Across two days of testing with T5 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>; 8 evaluation blocks), average performance was 4.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39 bps, which was significantly greater than the 6 \u00d7 6 performance (p&lt;0.01, Student\u2019s <i>t</i> test) and represents, to our knowledge, the highest documented BCI communication rate for a person with motor impairment."

Number ranges represent performance measurements across all participants for a given study.

As there are many such algorithms, the current work excluded word prediction or completion to focus on measuring the performance of the underlying system. The most appropriate points of comparison, when available, are bitrates, which are independent of word prediction or completion algorithms. Similarly, information transfer rates are also a meaningful point of comparison, though they are less reflective of practical communication rates than bitrate (which takes into account the need to correct errors; detailed in <a href=\"#bib42\">Nuyujukian et al.

Further research sessions, in which T6 was asked to suppress her natural movements to the best of her abilities, showed similar performance in both copy typing and grid tasks (detailed in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and supplements, which quantify her performance and the degree to which she was able to suppress movements). As might be expected, T6 found that suppressing her natural movement was a challenging, cognitively demanding task. Though she did this to the best of her abilities, the act of imagining finger movement still elicited minute movements, both during \u2018open-loop\u2019 decoder calibration where she was imagining movements, and during closed-loop control of the BCI. While we were unable to record EMG activity (as permission to do so had not previously been sought), we were able to record the movements of her fingers using a commercially-available \u2018dataglove\u2019 sensor system. This was also used for research sessions in which decoder calibration was based on her physical movements. Overall, when T6 actively attempted to suppress movements, her movement was reduced by a factor of 7.2\u201312.6 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Despite this factor of 7.2\u201312.6 in movement suppression, performance was quite similar to performance when T6 moved freely - across all three quantitative evaluation types (Grid, OPTI-II, QWERTY), the performance differences were within 0\u201320% and not significant (p&gt;0.2 in all cases, Student\u2019s <i>t</i> test)."

Participant T6 was capable of dexterous finger movements (as opposed to participants T5 and T7, who retained no functional movements of their limbs). To control for the possibility that physical movements underlie the demonstrated improvement in neural control, we measured T6\u2019s BCI performance during the same quantitative performance evaluation tasks, but asked her to suppress her movements as best as she could. In these sessions, decoders were calibrated based on imagined (rather than attempted) finger movements. (<b>a</b>) During copy typing evaluations with movements suppressed, T6\u2019s average performance using the OPTI-II keyboard was 28.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0 ccpm (mean \u00b1 s.d.), and her average performance using the QWERTY keyboard was 19.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3 ccpm (as discussed in the main text, her performance while moving freely was 31.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7 ccpm and 23.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.5 ccpm for the OPTI-II and QWERTY keyboards, respectively). (<b>b</b>) During grid evaluations with movements suppressed, T6\u2019s achieved bitrate was 2.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17 bps (compared to 2.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 bps while moving freely). We note that using the BCI while suppressing movements is a more difficult and cognitively demanding task - since the participant\u2019s natural, intuitive attempts to move actually generate physical movements, she needed instead to imagine movements, and restrict her motor cortical activity to patterns that do not generate movement. (This is supported by the participants own comment regarding the difficulty in controlling the BCI while imagining movement without actually moving: \u2018It is a learning curve for me to not move while imagining.\u2019) Despite this additional cognitive demand, performance with movements suppressed was quite similar to performance when the participant moved freely (within 0\u201320%) - in all three cases, the differences in performance were not significant (p&gt;0.2 in all cases, Student\u2019s <i>t</i> test). Data are from T6\u2019s trial days 595 and 598."

Here we quantified the degree to which movements were suppressed during those sessions. We first analyzed the participant\u2019s movements during decoder calibration (panels <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>) and then closed-loop BCI control (panel <b>c</b>). For decoder calibration, we compared freely moving sessions and sessions in which movements were suppressed (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods: Quantifying movement suppression). Decoders were calibrated using a center-out-and-back task, with the cursor\u2019s position tied to the measured finger position (freely moving sessions) or with the cursor\u2019s position following pre-programmed movements (i.e., \u2018open-loop\u2019 calibration) and finger movements were imagined (movement suppressed sessions). For each condition (i.e., freely moving vs. suppressed movement), we measured finger position as a function of time (relative to the starting position for each trial), and averaged these positions across all trials for a given target direction (the position of each pair of traces denotes the target\u2019s position relative to the center target). (<b>a</b>) During movement-based decoder calibration (freely moving sessions), thumb movements (red) controlled the vertical axis, while index finger movements (blue) controlled the horizontal axis. Horizontal scale bars represent 200 ms, and the vertical scale bar represents 100 units on the glove sensor scale (arbitrary units). (<b>b</b>) During open-loop decoder calibration (movement suppressed sessions), in which T6 was asked to simply imagine finger movements but avoid moving to the best of her abilities, finger movements were largely suppressed but minute movement was still detectable. Scale bars match the previous panel. Overall, during decoder calibration, movements were greatly reduced (p&lt;0.01, paired Student\u2019s <i>t</i> test), and the median suppression ratio was a factor of 7.2 (index finger) and 12.6 (thumb). (<b>c</b>) We also quantified the amount of movement during closed-loop BCI control (grid task) in sessions in which movements were suppressed. Because individual trials were highly variable (targets appeared in random locations during the grid task), we grouped trials by the target direction (i.e., the angle between the previous target and the prompted target for the current trial). The position of each pair of traces in the circle denotes the target direction. To ensure that any minute movements were captured in the analysis, the absolute value (rather than the signed value) of the finger position was taken prior to averaging across trials. Scale bars match the previous panel. As shown, movement during closed-loop BCI control was comparable to or less than movement during decoder calibration (panel <b>b</b>), which itself was a factor of 7.2\u201312.6 times less than movement during movement-based decoder calibration (panel <b>a</b>)."

In surveying people with ALS, (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huggins et al., 2011</a>) found that 59% of respondents would be satisfied with a communication BCI that achieved 10\u201314 ccpm (2\u20132.8 wpm), while 72% would be satisfied with 15\u201319 ccpm (3\u20133.8 wpm). Thus, the current performance would likely be viewed positively by many people with ALS. Current performance still falls short of typical communication rates for able-bodied subjects using smartphones (12\u201319 wpm [<a href=\"#bib24\">Hoggan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lopez et al., 2009</a>]), touch typing (40\u201360 wpm [<a href=\"#bib34\">MacKenzie and Soukoreff, 2002</a>]), and speaking (90\u2013170 spoken wpm [<a href=\"#bib64\">Venkatagiri, 1999</a>]); continued research is directed toward restoring communication toward rates that match able-bodied subjects."

Inclusion of detailed measurement protocols will help in demonstrating the repeatability (or variability) of various BCI approaches and establish further confidence as BCIs move closer to becoming more broadly available for people who would benefit from assistive communication technologies. The grid task and bit rate assessment described previously and in this manuscript may serve as a valuable task and metric to document further progress in BCI decoding."

Important next steps would be to apply the BCI developed here to a generalized computing interface that includes word completion and prediction algorithms to further boost the effective communication rates of the overall system. Regardless of the assistive platform chosen, all systems would benefit from higher performing BCI algorithms. We also note that the data for participants T6 and T7 was collected 1.5 years after neurosurgical placement of the intracortical recording arrays.

Specifically, we found that activity on T6\u2019s array had the highest neural modulation when attempting or imagining movements of her contralateral thumb and index finger, and further, that these two independent effectors could be merged to provide closed-loop control of a single effector (cursor). We also found that this thumb and index finger-based control modality increased system robustness and yielded decoders that were more resilient to nonstationarities. Finally, we found that a separate behavioral approach, ipsilateral hand squeeze, provided an independent, readily-combined control dimension to support discrete selection. We performed a similar protocol for evaluating behavioral imagery strategies with participant T5 and found his highest neural modulation was elicited when imagining movements of the whole arm. We combined this imagery strategy with ipsilateral hand squeeze (mirroring findings from participant T6) to yield simultaneous high performance continuous control and discrete selection."

To counteract these effects, we introduced a variant of the bias correction method used in <a href=\"#bib27\">Jarosiewicz et al. (2015)</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hochberg et al. (2012)</a> with T7 (detailed in Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), which continuously estimated and corrected biases during closed-loop BCI use and resulted in more stable control. Further, instead of calibrating a new decoder between measurement sets (as was done for T6), we found it was sufficient to keep the decoder constant and simply perform a short target acquisition task to estimate and update the underlying bias estimate. We therefore incorporated this revised protocol (holding decoders constant, and simply updating the underlying bias estimate) for sessions with T5."

However, we note that T6 and T5\u2019s communication rates were substantially better than those of T7. Many factors could have contributed to this difference in performance. Certainly, with any skilled motor task, one expects to see variation in performance across participants, even in able-bodied subjects (e.g. playing sports or musical instruments). As ALS is a disease with a large degree of variance in its effects, participant-specific differences in disease effects or progression may play a role in the differences in performance between T6 and T7. Interestingly, we note that in the center-out-and-back task (where reaction times can be most easily measured), T7 demonstrated increased response latency relative to T6. Specifically, the time between the appearance of a cued target and neural modulation corresponding to a movement attempt was more than 100 ms later for T7 relative to T6. It is unclear whether this additional latency was due to variability in the effects of ALS across participants. Differences in the participants\u2019 prior experiences may have also played a role: T6 was much more familiar with computing devices, while T7 rarely used them. This difference in familiarity / comfort with text entry may have contributed to the difference in typing rates."

As described in the Results section, to test the effects of movement generation on BCI control, we performed separate sessions in which T6 suppressed her movement to the best of her ability, and found no measurable effect on BCI performance. This result is consistent with previous studies that have evaluated the effects of movement on BCI control. For example, Gilja*, Nuyujukian* et al. (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gilja et al., 2012</a>) compared BCI performance in non-human primates while their arms were either restrained or able to move freely, and found little difference in performance. Additionally, Ethier et al (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ethier et al., 2012</a>). showed that monkeys whose grasping movements were prevented using a paralytic agent were still able to reliably generate grasping-related cortical activity, which could then be decoded to activate a functional electrical stimulation system that restored grasping ability. Multiple participants with no movement of their limbs have also successfully controlled a computer cursor or other external device through this intracortical BCI (e.g., ref. [<a href=\"#bib23\">Hochberg et al., 2006</a>], participants S1 and S2, and ref. [<a href=\"#bib22\">Hochberg et al., 2012</a>], participant T2). Finally, we recently investigated the effects of movement on cursor control quality in detail with clinical trial participants and found no decrease in performance when movements were suppressed (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gilja et al., 2015</a>)."

All three cases are representative examples of arm and hand movement capabilities of the severely motor impaired population, and, in all three cases, the participants communicated with the BCI at rates that exceeded any previous study of people with motor impairment. Further, there was little if any correspondence between the participants\u2019 movement abilities and BCI performance."

However, he passed away (from causes unrelated to the trial) before we were able to perform those research sessions. As mentioned above, we initially found that neural features with participant T7 exhibited drifts in baseline firing rates over time, which necessitated the integration of strategies to mitigate the effects of these baseline drifts on continuous cursor control. Thus, our plan for data collection was to first develop these strategies and carefully document performance with T7 using continuous cursor control only, and subsequently add the HMM for discrete selection. The first part was successful \u2013 as shown, T7 achieved high quality continuous control, and the resultant communication performance was double that of the previous highest-performing approach. Unfortunately, however, T7 passed away before the HMM sessions could be conducted."

The \u2018point-and-click\u2019 approach demonstrated in the current paper (i.e., continuous control over a cursor\u2019s movement, plus a decoder for discrete selection [<a href=\"#bib57\">Simeral et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bacher et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jarosiewicz et al., 2015</a>]) was investigated instead because it has certain practical advantages over the classification approach. In particular, developing a robust point-and-click controller provides a flexible interface that can be applied to a wide variety of computing devices. A point-and-click controller could be integrated with mobile computing interfaces (i.e., smartphones or tablets) that would dramatically increase what is achievable with the BCI, without the need for the development of custom software for each function (as would be needed for a discrete interface). Finally, and perhaps most fundamentally, as this approach enables both continuous movements and selections, it is more general as long as performance is high (as reported here). Thus, point-and-click interfaces are a key step to creating BCIs that allow flexible, general-purpose computing use."

However, there are multiple technical challenges to the previously demonstrated approaches, and multiple unknowns when translating these approaches to people. From a technical standpoint, one of the primary challenges is that a multi-class discrete classifier may need a specified time window over which to classify neural features into a discrete selection. In the earlier high-performance study with non-human primates (<a href=\"#bib50\">Santhanam et al., 2006</a>), this necessitated a \u2018fixed pace\u2019 design in which the monkeys were prompted to make a sequence of selections at a fixed timing interval. Such an approach may prove more difficult with people typing messages, which requires the flexibility to actively think about what to type and to type at a free pace. A potential approach to enable a \u2018free-paced\u2019 BCI was demonstrated in follow-on studies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Achtman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kemere et al., 2008</a>), which showed in offline analyses that state transitions could be inferred automatically from neural activity, thus automatically detecting the necessary time window for classification. But this has not been demonstrated in closed-loop experiments by our group or, to our knowledge, by other groups. Thus there are multiple technical and scientific challenges to address, and developing these approaches for clinical trial participants is an active area of research."

He also retains some slight residual movement which is inconsistently present in both the upper and lower extremities, mainly seen at ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, wrist, fingers and elbow, more consistently present on the left than on the right. Occasionally, the initial slight voluntary movement triggers involuntary spastic flexion of the limb.

However, as demonstrated in Kovach et al., the magnitude of this phenomenon falls sharply with the distance from the ventral temporal cortical surface. Further, the same study demonstrated that these artifacts are highly correlated across scales less than 1 cm, and that rereferencing on these local scales eliminates the artifacts outside of the immediate ventral temporal cortical surface (Kovach et al., Fig. 9). In our study, data are collected in motor cortical areas which are fairly medial in the precentral gyrus (frontal lobe), and are rereferenced using the common average across the intracortical array (4 mm x 4 mm). Given the large distance between the recording site and the ventral temporal cortical surface, and the common average rereferencing, any minor eye movement-related EMG artifacts are expected to be essentially eliminated."

All calibration data were collected with a center-out-and-back target configuration. For the quantitative evaluations, initial filters were calibrated based on data collected during a center-out-and-back task performed under motor control (T6) or automated open-loop control (all T5 and T7). During motor control tasks, T6 controlled the cursor\u2019s x and y velocities using index finger and thumb movements, respectively, and acquired targets by holding the cursor still over the target (dwell tasks) or squeezing her left hand (ipsilateral to the implanted array) when the cursor was over the target (click tasks). T6\u2019s physical movements were recorded using left- and right-handed datagloves (5DT, Irvine, CA). This was not performed for participants T7 and T5 because they did not have functional use of their arms or hands. During automated open-loop calibration (T5 and T7), the cursor\u2019s movements followed pre-programmed trajectories, and the participants attempted movements to follow the cursor\u2019s movement. In addition, during open-loop calibration, T5 attempted to squeeze his left hand to acquire targets. After initial filter calibration, both continuous control and discrete filters were then recalibrated using closed-loop neural control data. This closed-loop recalibration block closely followed (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gilja et al., 2015</a>), with the addition of a discrete selection for T6 and T5. Because the quality of the initial VKF filter varied from day to day, the recalibration blocks for T6 and T7 also used error attenuation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hochberg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Velliste et al., 2008</a>) to ensure that the participant could reach all targets."

Thus, for the ReFIT-KF decoder, updated cursor velocity estimates were provided every 15 ms for use in the rest of the BMI system. This velocity was integrated to update the cursor position estimate every 1 ms, and therefore the most recent cursor position was sent to the display every 1 ms. The computer monitor was updated every 8.3 ms (i.e., at the 120 Hz frame rate of the monitor) with the most recent estimate of the desired cursor position. The high update rate is important so as to not inadvertently and deleteriously add latency into the BMI which is a closed-loop feedback control system (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cunningham et al., 2011</a>) and which was possible by using a commercially available high-speed monitor. This system design and these timings are consistent with our previous work (Gilja*, Nuyujukian* et al. Nat Neurosci 2012 [<a href=\"#bib18\">Gilja et al., 2012</a>] binned neural data and used the ReFIT-KF to decode every 50 ms; Gilja*, Pandarinath*, et al.

This operates faster and more accurately than a recent report claims is possible with a Kalman filter (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shanechi et al., 2017</a>), and at a higher level of performance than recently reported (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shanechi et al., 2017</a>)."

Each blockset was considered a complete and independent unit, equally weighted, and statistically identical to all other blocksets. Blockset timing structure is defined in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. Each blockset began with a recalibration block, which resulted in new cursor movement and click decoders for participant T6. For participants T5 and T7, the movement decoder was held constant and the recalibration block was simply used to create an updated estimate of the underlying velocity bias. This recalibration protocol was used to maximize the performance of the data collected in the time-locked blocks that followed. Three data blocks were then collected in a randomized fashion, constituting a blockset. Each blockset consisted of one block each of three tasks. The three tasks with participant T6 and T5 were the grid task, the QWERTY task, and the OPTI-II task. With participant T7, the QWERTY task was substituted with the ABCDEF task, since he had minimal experience with the conventional (QWERTY) keyboard layout. The task order in each blockset was randomized subject to the constraint that the two copy typing tasks were always adjacent. This constraint minimized the amount of elapsed time between the copy typing blocks, in order to minimize any confounding effects on measured typing rate. The prompted sentence to copy in both keyboard tasks for a given blockset was identical. Following the completion of a blockset, participants were given as long a break (to request a drink from a caregiver, etc.) as desired before starting the subsequent blockset. Breaks within a blockset were minimized as best as possible."

For T7, who could only select targets by dwelling on them, selection used a strategy called \u2018cumulative dwell time\u2019 \u2013 each target had a separate hold time counter, and the cumulative time spent over a target counted towards the 1.5 s requirement (i.e., it was not required that the 1.5 s be contiguous).

This was used with both participants, with timings and promptings identical to the QWERTY and ABCDEF tasks.

As mentioned earlier, finger movements were measured using a dataglove (5DT, Irvine, CA). For each condition (i.e., freely moving vs. suppressed movement), we measured the finger position as a function of time (relative to the starting position for each trial), and averaged these positions across all trials for a given target direction. To robustly evaluate the degree of suppression between freely moving and suppressed movement, we compared the time epochs spanning 600\u20131200 ms after target onset, which was well after movement was detectable but before movements became more variable across trials (i.e., to perform corrective movements as T6 approached the target). Movement suppression was only estimated for target directions in which movement on a given finger was to be expected to avoid singular values (e.g., as index finger movements were related to control of the horizontal dimension, index finger movements were not compared for the vertical targets where they would be expected to be 0). Data compared are from T6\u2019s trial days 570 (freely moving) and 595 (movements suppressed). We next quantified the degree to which movements were suppressed during closed-loop BCI control (Grid task). Individual trials were grouped by the target direction (i.e., the angle between the previous target and the prompted target for the current trial; eight possible directions) and finger positions were averaged across all trials of a given direction. Trials that lasted less than 1200 ms were excluded from the analysis. To ensure that any minute movements were captured, movements were quantified using the absolute value (rather than the signed value) of the finger position at each time point relative to the starting position for each trial. Analysis includes all Grid task data from T6\u2019s trial days 595 and 598 (movements suppressed). Unfortunately, for freely moving sessions, finger positions were not recorded during closed-loop BCI control, so data are unavailable for the specific comparison of finger movements during closed-loop BCI control for freely moving vs. movement suppressed sessions."

The authors previously published a study with the same participants (Gilja et al., 2015) using the same algorithm for cursor movement control. In the current study this is additionally combined with click selection (via an HMM) for spelling, which in the attached IEEE paper is shown to provide a modest but significant improvement on target selection. However, in one of the 2 subjects in the current study, click selection wasn't used. Thus, it is unclear how important is this addition for the exhibited performance. Relatedly, a recent noninvasive BCI spelling study on healthy subjects (Townsend &amp; Platsko, 2016) appear to exhibit similar performance to the current study (1.73 bps in their \"free spelling\" task, see their table 5). That study should be referred to and the comparison discussed. While the current study appears to exhibit the best spelling accuracy to date as measured on ALS patients using a BCI, another study (McCane et al., 2015) showed that ALS patents and age matched controls exhibit similar performance while using the noninvasive BCI speller used in the Townsend &amp; Platsko study. Thus, that study results arguably apply to ALS patients as well."

If possible, the authors should perform an additional experimental session where EMG signals from head muscles are recorded, or at least eye movements (including micro-saccades) are tracked, and show that the relevant control signals are uncorrelated with the EMG/eye movements."

This issue has not been explored in the current paper, and to my knowledge, in the series of studies on \"typing\" with humans or monkeys (except for Andersen, et al. (2004)). If the authors have done any offline data-analysis to test this idea, it would be very helpful to describe it briefly. Otherwise, why this approach has not yet been explored should be explained."

The main text should be more forthcoming about this, and mention that this is only what the subject was trying to do, however was not measured and quantified. Moreover, as EMG from the arm was not measured, it should be mentioned that an effect of nascent muscle commands (that did not elicit observable movements) on the performance cannot be ruled out. This is especially important, as subject T6 had better results, and her remaining finger movements were used to train her initial decoders. As different patients may or may not have specific residual movements, this makes performance comparisons between them less precise.

While it is unfortunate that the HMM could not be tested with the participant T7 (as described in Essential revisions #4 above), we now replicate the HMM results with an additional participant (T5) and show even higher performance than in the original manuscript."

We chose instead to reserve the raw performance metrics for the results. We believe that the most appropriate place to relate these performance metrics to broader communication methods (e.g., typing by healthy subjects) is the Discussion, and have now moved the text relating to communication rates for healthy subjects to the first paragraph of the Discussion. In sum, we can certainly appreciate how this suggestion makes sense and could help many appreciate this work even more, but in balance we believe that the present approach has some key advantages."

BCI typing speeds will eventually be limited only by the mean time of each cursor trajectory (between each letter selected), and any time used for the selection itself (dwell times, or \"click\"). This difference explains why the texting speeds of able-bodied subjects (which usually use only one finger) are lower that their keyboard typing speeds (which have discretized the alphabet into the 10 fingers). This issue has not been explored in the current paper, and to my knowledge, in the series of studies on \"typing\" with humans or monkeys (except for Andersen, et al. (2004)). If the authors have done any offline data-analysis to test this idea, it would be very helpful to describe it briefly.

The main text should be more forthcoming about this, and mention that this is only what the subject was trying to do, however was not measured and quantified. Moreover, as EMG from the arm was not measured, it should be mentioned that an effect of nascent muscle commands (that did not elicit observable movements) on the performance cannot be ruled out. This is especially important, as subject T6 had better results, and her remaining finger movements were used to train her initial decoders. As different patients may or may not have specific residual movements, this makes performance comparisons between them less precise. This point should also be mentioned, in the paragraph hypothesizing about the reasons for the performance differences between the subjects (main text, fifteenth paragraph).</i> "
