A systematic study of their collective function, however, is lacking and forms the focus of this study. We functionally reconstitute a two-dimensional actin-myosin interface using myosin V and VI precisely patterned on DNA nanostructures, in combination with a model keratocyte actin meshwork. While scaffolds display solely unidirectional movement, their directional flux is modulated by both actin architecture and the structural properties of the myosin lever arm. This directional flux can be finely-tuned by the relative number of myosin V and VI motors on each scaffold. Pairing computation with experimental observations suggests that the ratio of motor stall forces is a key determinant of the observed competitive outcomes. Overall, our study demonstrates an elegant mechanism for sorting of membrane cargo using equally matched antagonistic motors, simply by modulating the relative number of engagement sites for each motor type."

A systematic study of their collective function, however, is lacking and forms the focus of this study. We functionally reconstitute a two-dimensional actin-myosin interface using myosin V and VI precisely patterned on DNA nanostructures, in combination with a model keratocyte actin meshwork. While scaffolds display solely unidirectional movement, their directional flux is modulated by both actin architecture and the structural properties of the myosin lever arm. This directional flux can be finely-tuned by the relative number of myosin V and VI motors on each scaffold. Pairing computation with experimental observations suggests that the ratio of motor stall forces is a key determinant of the observed competitive outcomes. Overall, our study demonstrates an elegant mechanism for sorting of membrane cargo using equally matched antagonistic motors, simply by modulating the relative number of engagement sites for each motor type."

However, traditional reconstituted systems to study membrane traffic do not incorporate the effects of actin-myosin interactions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lee et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Zanetti et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, while unconventional myosins are necessary for timely membrane traffic, their functional role is not apparent in live cell studies (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hasson et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Sahlender et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hartman et al., 2011</a>). The bulk of our knowledge of unconventional myosin function instead stems from single molecule biophysical and structural studies, which demonstrate distinct functional regimes for actin-myosin interactions including bi-directional motion, unidirectional transport, and mechano-sensitive anchoring (<a href=\"#bib38\">Trybus, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Spudich and Sivaramakrishnan, 2010</a>). There remains, however, a considerable gap between the insights gained from single-motor studies and a mechanistic understanding of cargo transport in living cells. Furthermore, membrane trafficking often involves multiple disparate motor types, and their collective function cannot be trivially extrapolated from single molecule studies. In this study, we focus on myosin V and VI, two opposing unconventional myosins that co-reside on membrane vesicles in neuronal growth cones (<a href=\"#bib35\">Suter et al., 2000</a>). Myosin V has been implicated in secretory traffic, whereas myosin VI facilitates timely endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Suter et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kneussel and Wagner, 2013</a>). Individual myosin V and VI molecules within a transport ensemble may coordinate, cooperate, or mechanically impede one another to influence collective movement (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rogers et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Sivaramakrishnan and Spudich, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lu et al., 2012</a>).

In the case of myosin V and VI, they are considered evenly matched antagonistic motors (<a href=\"#bib38\">Trybus, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Spudich and Sivaramakrishnan, 2010</a>). Both motors are thought to bind membrane cargo as dimers; myosin V through a coiled-coil motif following its lever arm that natively homodimerizes it, and myosin VI presumably through dimeric adaptor proteins that link it to cargo (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mehta et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buss and Kendrick-Jones, 2008</a>). Homodimers of either myosin move processively on actin filaments with similar step sizes (V\u201436 nm; VI\u201430 nm), stepping kinetics (V \u201312 s<sup>\u22121</sup>; VI \u20139 s<sup>\u22121</sup>), and stall forces (V \u223c3 pN; VI \u223c2 pN) albeit in opposing directions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mehta et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Rief et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Rock et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Nishikawa et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Yildiz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Altman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Uemura et al., 2004</a>). All myosin levers, with the exception of myosin VI, swing towards the barbed (plus) end of the actin filament. In the case of myosin VI, a unique insert reverses the direction of its lever stroke towards the pointed (minus) end of the actin filament (<a href=\"#bib17\">Liao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Spudich and Sivaramakrishnan, 2010</a>). With the plus-ends of actin networks oriented toward the cell periphery, plus-end directed myosin V thus contributes to exocytosis, whereas minus-end directed myosin VI is critical to endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hartman et al., 2011</a>). Finally, despite their many similarities, myosin V and VI have structurally distinct lever arms. The myosin V lever consists of six light chain binding IQ-motifs wrapped with calmodulin light chains (<a href=\"#bib38\">Trybus, 2008</a>). The myosin VI lever is composed of two calmodulin-binding IQ-motifs followed by a pliable proximal tail domain, and a semi-rigid single \u03b1-helical domain (<a href=\"#bib34\">Spudich and Sivaramakrishnan, 2010</a>)."

(2011)</a> reported that tethering a single myosin V and a single VI homodimer on a quantum dot leads to unidirectional motion on single actin filaments, with myosin V dominating the competition (79% of processive runs towards the plus-end of actin filaments). We recently extended this finding to DNA nanostructures containing two myosin V and two myosin VI molecules interacting with a keratocyte-derived actin network (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>). While we did observe solely unidirectional movement, in contrast to <a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al. (2011)</a>, myosin V and VI were evenly matched in our system (52% of processive runs towards the keratocyte cell periphery). Our previous study focused on trajectory shapes and did not address this observed discrepancy in the outcome of the competition. Further, the generality of these observations for different ratios of myosin V and VI and the mechanisms that control directionality remain unexplored and form the focus of this study."

Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>), we observe solely unidirectional movement regardless of actin architecture or relative myosin number. However, for matched scaffolds we find that the directional flux is dependent on both actin architecture and the structural properties of the myosin lever arm. This directional flux is finely-tuned by the relative number of myosin V and VI motors on each scaffold. By pairing computation and experiment, we identify a single mechanical parameter that defines regimes in any motor ensemble wherein this mechanism is likely to be observed. Overall, our study demonstrates an elegant mechanism for sorting of membrane cargo simply by modulating the relative number of engagement sites for each motor type. For matched, but opposing motors such as myosin V and VI, this mechanism is necessary and sufficient to precisely control sorting of tethered scaffolds."

Precise positioning of myosin V and VI on the origami scaffold was achieved using myosins labeled with single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides complementary to attachment sequences projecting from the scaffold strand (1\u20136 per scaffold; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). DNA nanostructures with varying numbers of myosin are denoted as <i>x</i>V:<i>y</i>VI, where \u2018<i>x</i>\u2019 is the number of myosin V dimers and \u2018<i>y</i>\u2019 is the number of myosin VI dimers per scaffold. For the 2D actin networks, we used detergent-extracted keratocytes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), which have a sufficiently large surface area (\u223c10 \u03bcm \u00d7 \u223c30 \u03bcm) allowing for simultaneous tracking of multiple myosin-labeled scaffolds. Experiments involving 1D actin filaments provide a confined set of actin-myosin interactions, with each myosin having either a forward (red rectangle) or a backward (gray rectangle) binding site available (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The 2D actin networks, on the other hand, provide a more complex energy landscape for the myosins to navigate, as there are multiple binding sites for both forward (red arc) and backward (gray arc) steps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>)."

However, they disagree in the observed outcome of the competition. Myosin V dominates the competition (79%) when it is tethered to myosin VI through a quantum dot (2 total) and the two compete on a single actin filament (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, myosin V and VI are evenly matched (myosin V wins 52%) when two of each motor (4 total) are tethered to a DNA nanostructure and they compete on a two-dimensional cellular actin network. This discrepancy between the observations could stem from either the scaffold type (quantum dot vs DNA nanostructure), the total motor number (2 vs 4), or the actin architecture (single filament vs keratocyte-derived actin network). We first tested the influence of scaffold type by assessing the competition between a single myosin V dimer and a single myosin VI dimer on 1D actin filaments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In positive controls, \u00d8V:2VI scaffolds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) move toward the minus-end of the actin filaments, whereas 2V:\u00d8VI scaffolds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) travel toward the plus-end. Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>), scaffolds with both myosin V and myosin VI (1V:1VI) commit to a single direction on actin filaments (&gt;99%; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) with no directional reversal detected. The movement of 1V:1VI scaffolds on single actin filaments is dominated by plus-end directed movement (\u03a6<sub><i>out</i></sub> = 68 \u00b1 1%; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), which is qualitatively consistent with previous observations using quantum dot scaffolds (79% plus-end directed [<a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al., 2011</a>]). Hence, scaffold type (quantum dot vs DNA nanostructure) is not the key determinant of competitive outcome. We next examined the influence of actin architecture. In contrast to single actin filaments, both plus and minus-end directed movement is equally represented (\u03a6<sub><i>out</i></sub> = 52 \u00b1 1%; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) for 1V:1VI scaffolds moving along 2D keratocyte actin networks. Hence, the discrepancy between previous reports using quantum dots (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al., 2011</a>) and DNA nanostructures (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>) stems primarily from the actin architecture."

Likewise, the speed of nanostructure movement on the keratocyte network decreases as the difference in the number of the two motor types approaches zero (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These reductions in speed with antagonistic motors are in agreement with the previously published experiments involving quantum dots conjugated to one myosin V and one myosin VI (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al., 2011</a>). Based on the reduction in speed for antagonistic ensembles, as compared to groups of one myosin type, we hypothesized that all of the motors can continuously interact with the actin tracks and collectively engage in competition. To test this hypothesis, scaffolds were formed with three myosin V and three myosin VI (3V:3VI), where one of the motor types was attached by photo-cleavable linkers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). Regardless of which motor type is cleaved, removal of one myosin type from the competition increases the speed and results in a single direction of movement (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013F</a>). The directional switch and increase in speed after photo-cleavage indicate that all motors, regardless of type, are able to access the actin tracks and engage in continuous competition. Together, these observations suggest that the collective movement is due to a continuous interaction of both motor types, and not due to detachment of losing motors from the actin track (or scaffold), when overpowered by the winning motor. Lastly, the underlying continuous interaction is also consistent with our previous observation that myosin V changes the trajectory shape of ensembles of myosin V and VI on 2D actin tracks (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>)."

In the model, two opposing motors are coupled mechanically through a linear spring of strength <i>k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Since the motor proteins are the most flexible components of the scaffold\u2013motor complex, <i>k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> is dominated by the flexibility of the myosin motors. Each motor consists of two catalytic heads that are connected by a lever arm with flexural rigidity <i>k</i><sub><i>F</i></sub>. Each motor also has a comparable, albeit mismatched, stall force (1 \u2264 <i>F</i><sub><i>high</i></sub><i>/F</i><sub><i>low</i></sub> \u2264 <i>2</i>), where <i>F</i><sub><i>high</i></sub> and <i>F</i><sub><i>low</i></sub> are the stall forces of the stronger (myosin V) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mehta et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Uemura et al., 2004</a>) and weaker (myosin VI) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Rock et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Nishikawa et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Altman et al., 2004</a>) motors, respectively. Our model assumes that a motor can only perform a forward step if the resulting inter-motor tension (<i>T</i>) is less than its stall force (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). A successful step increases the inter-motor tension by \u2206<i>T = k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>\u2022<i>s</i>, where <i>s</i> is the motor step size. Initially <i>T</i> is set to zero and both motors take forward steps stochastically in opposite directions, increasing <i>T</i> with each step. This sequence of movement proceeds until a forward step increases <i>T</i> beyond the stall force of the stepping motor, which undergoes a conformational change that leads to its preferential back-stepping (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gebhardt et al., 2006</a>) thereby relieving inter-motor tension (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al., 2011</a>)."

(<b>A</b>) TEM image of a keratocyte actin network (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>). (<b>B</b>) To investigate the influence of network structure to the stepping dynamics (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), the TEM image in (<b>A</b>) was first scaled by a factor of 0.5\u20131.25. The image was then skeletonized to derive the position of actin filaments (green lines) as described in <a href=\"#bib31\">Sivaramakrishnan and Spudich (2009)</a>. Every pixel is a possible binding site for a myosin motor head. (<b>C</b>) Next, we calculated the orientation of each actin filament relative to the polarity field vector for each pixel in the digitalized image. A 7 \u00d7 7 box was centered over each pixel, and based on the skeletonized filament in the search box each pixel was fit to a linear function. The local filament direction was then calculated by taking the inverse tangent of this fit. Pixels that fit poorly (<math id=\"inf8\"><mrow><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></math> &lt; 0.25) were excluded (14% of the detected pixels in [<b>B</b>]) from the simulation. The energy for each binding site was calculated from these filament directions (see <b>L</b>). For our model, the myosin pair consisted of either two identical myosin dimers with lever arm stiffness <i>k</i><sub><i>F</i></sub>. Each myosin dimer has two motor domains (gray sandals), and each myosin pair is linked through their centers of mass by a linear spring <i>k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>. Finally, in each myosin a leading (\u2460 or \u2461) and a trailing head is indicated. (<b>D</b>) Motor 1's trailing head is placed randomly on an actin filament. (<b>E</b>\u2013<b>H</b>) The position of the leading head (<b>E</b>) and the second myosin (<b>F</b>\u2013<b>H</b>) are randomly assigned with only two restrictions. First the inter-motor distance between myosin heads must be 36 \u00b1 7.2 nm (gray arc; [<b>E</b> and <b>H</b>]). Second distance between the centers of mass of a motor pair must be 65 \u00b1 15 nm (red ring; [<b>F</b> and <b>H</b>]). (<b>I</b>) The position of all motor heads, the centers of mass for each myosin dimer, and the center of the two centers of mass are tracked during each simulation step. (<b>J</b>) Myosin V and VI dimers step stochastically on actin filaments with exponentially distributed dwell times. In our simulations, an exponential distribution of mean dwell times based on the cycle rates of myosin V and VI (<a href=\"#bib43\">De La Cruz et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">De La Cruz et al., 2001</a>) was used to derive the dwell times for each motor step. In this example, <i>t</i><sub><i>1</i></sub>&gt; <i>t</i><sub><i>2</i></sub> and myosin 2 moves first. (<b>K</b>) For a motor to step, the trailing head of motor (motor 2) pivots about the lead head and its binding site is determined by the following criteria: (a) The binding site must be 36 \u00b1 7.2 nm pixel from the leading head (gray arc). (b) The new center of mass for stepping motor (motor 2) must be within 65 \u00b1 15 nm (red ring) from the center of mass of the non-stepping motor (myosin 1). (c) The stepping myosin must proceed in a forward direction determined by the actin network polarity. (<b>L</b>) For each pixel meeting these requirements (<i>i</i>), the energy <i>G</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> and Boltzmann probability <i>P</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> are calculated. (<b>M</b>) A binding site for each new leading head is then stochastically choosen based on the calculated Boltzmann probabilities calculated in (<b>L</b>). (<b>N</b>) The change in inter-motor tension is then calculated (\u2206<i>T</i> = \u2206<i>T</i><sub><i>post</i></sub> \u2212 \u2206<i>T</i><sub><i>pre</i></sub>). The simulation was repeated for \u2265400 times. The tension change \u2206<i>T</i> was quantified and presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 2, 3</a>."

Parallel simulations on digitized keratocyte actin networks, however, incorporate an additional parameter, namely flexural rigidity of the myosin lever arm <i>k</i><sub><i>F</i></sub> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), to account for the misalignment of the lever arm relative to the local actin filament where the myosin head is bound (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1L</a>). Simulations on these networks show that the mean inter-motor tension per step (<i>\u2206T</i>) can be significantly influenced by relative torsional stiffness (<i>k</i><sub><i>F</i></sub><i>/k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>), regardless of network mesh size or inter-motor stiffness (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133</a>). On a 2D network, the higher the <i>k</i><sub><i>F</i></sub><i>/k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> of a motor, the greater the <i>\u2206T</i> when it steps forward. Thus one can model movement along a 2D network with a similar simulation on a 1D track by redefining <i>\u2206T</i> such that different <i>\u2206T</i> values are accrued in each step based on which motor steps forward (<i>\u2206T</i><sub><i>high</i></sub> and <i>\u2206T</i><sub><i>low</i></sub> for rigid and flexible motors respectively). For such simulations on 2D networks, linking a rigid motor (<i>k</i><sub><i>F</i></sub><i>/k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> &gt;&gt; 1; <i>\u2206T</i><sub><i>high</i></sub>) to a more flexible one (<i>k</i><sub><i>F</i></sub><i>/k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> &lt;&lt; 1; <i>\u2206T</i><sub><i>low</i></sub>) is sufficient to systematically bias the competition in favor of the flexible motor (\u2193\u03a6<sub><i>out</i></sub> with \u2191<i>\u2206T</i><sub><i>high</i></sub><i>/\u2206T</i><sub><i>low</i></sub>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>).

Based on this measurement, the simulations estimate a <i>\u2206T</i><sub><i>high</i></sub><i>/\u2206T</i><sub><i>low</i></sub> = 1.20 \u00b1 0.05 (\u2295; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) that is consistent with a higher flexural rigidity for myosin V (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Therefore, our simulations reveal that the greater flexural rigidity of myosin V compared to myosin VI is sufficient to equalize the competition on 2D networks."

Myosin V is implicated in secretory traffic, whereas myosin VI is important for timely endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Suter et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Sahlender et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kneussel and Wagner, 2013</a>). While previous studies have examined the competition between myosin V and VI (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>), a systematic measurement of their collective behavior is unexplored and formed the focus of this study. We report that while antagonistic motor ensembles display solely unidirectional movement, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>), their directional sorting can be linearly tuned by the relative number of the two motor types. Further, this directional sorting can be modulated independently by the myosin lever arm and the actin architecture. These observations support a simple generalizable model, wherein competitive outcome is dependent on the ratio of the stall forces of the antagonistic motor types. Taken together, our findings provide an elegant mechanism for regulating vesicle sorting mediated by unconventional myosins, without the need to either segregate motor subtypes to distinct cargo (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hartman et al., 2011</a>) or engage regulatory proteins that preferentially modulate the accessibility or activity of one of the motor types (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fu and Holzbaur, 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "One model for the observed unidirectional transport is that only a single myosin on the DNA scaffold interacts with the actin network at any given time. Under these conditions, the probability of movement towards the cell center or periphery is proportional to the relative number of myosin VI or V, respectively. However, this mechanism for the observed sorting is refuted by four distinct observations. First, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>), scaffold run length linearly increases with motor number (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), suggesting that multiple motors on the same scaffold are capable of interacting with the actin network. Second, scaffold speed changes substantially with varying number and type of myosin motors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). For scaffolds with a given number of myosins, those with a single subtype move faster than those with both myosin V and VI. The reduction in speed with both myosin subtypes is consistent with the trailing myosin interacting with the actin network, despite the unidirectional movement of the scaffold. This interpretation is consistent with the coordinated back-stepping of the trailing motor observed by <a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al. (2007)</a>. Third, for scaffolds with both subtypes the speed decreases as the numbers of myosin V and VI are more evenly matched. This systematic reduction in speed alone argues for progressive engagement of additional antagonistic motors with the actin network. Fourth, experiments with photo-cleavable myosin-scaffold linkages further show that removal of the antagonistic myosin leads to either an increase in speed (release trailing motor) or a reversal in direction (release leading motor) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Altogether, given these observations we propose an alternate model that emphasizes inter-motor interactions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

For ensembles with mismatched motors (<i>r</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> &gt; 2), the model predicts unidirectional movement led solely by the stronger motor. However, for motors of similar strength (1 &lt; <i>r</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> &lt; 2), the model predicts that either motor may lead the unidirectional motion, with the directional flux of scaffolds dependent on <i>r</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>. These predictions are consistent with the unidirectional movement observed here, and in a previous report based on experiments using a single myosin V and a single myosin VI attached to a quantum dot (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al., 2011</a>). Further, the model is in agreement with a recent report of unidirectional trajectories for DNA scaffolds linked to both kinesins and dyneins on 1D microtubules (<a href=\"#bib8\">Derr et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Roberts et al., 2014</a>). However, it differs from the bi-directional movement of isolated endosomes that are driven by a combination of native kinesin and dynein motors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Soppina et al., 2009</a>). We speculate, though, that bi-directional movement stems from the influence of additional regulatory elements on native endosomes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kunwar et al., 2011</a>). Lastly, our model explains the differences in sorting observed in actin filaments vs 2D networks, and the role of the myosin lever arm in regulating sorting. In essence, motors with greater intra-motor torsional strain (rigid lever) experience a larger inter-motor tension per step and hence lose their competitive edge on 2D networks."

Our study, however, suggests a broader regulatory role for the lever arm in membrane trafficking. We find that the structural properties of the myosin lever arm control the directional flux of scaffolds on our model cellular actin network, thus having implications on sorting of vesicular cargo. Beyond this observation, structural elements in myosins have been shown to influence motility on actin networks. For instance, an extension of the myosin X lever arm is necessary for its preferential processive movement on parallel actin bundles, but not on single actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brawley and Rock, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Nagy and Rock, 2010</a>). Myosin VI, on the other hand, has a unique three-helix bundle in its lever arm, which can unfold to alter the motor's structural properties (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mukherjea et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, for groups of myosin V and VI, the flexibility of the lever arm controls trajectory shapes on 2D actin networks (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>). In addition to myosin structure, actin architecture also influences myosin function. For example, single myosin V and VI have different stepping dynamics at actin filament intersections (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al., 2007</a>) then on actin bundles (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ali et al., 2013</a>). An in situ motility assay using detergent-extracted cells also reported that individual myosin V, VI, and X dimers show preferential motility on different actin architectures (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brawley and Rock, 2009</a>). Together, these studies suggest a subtler regulation of cellular processes that emerges from unique structural features in myosins that modulate either individual or collective actin-myosin interactions."

Single-stranded M13mp18 DNA (NEB) were mixed with fourfold excess of short stable strands (IDT, Coralville, IA), followed by 2 hr annealing as previously described (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rothemund, 2006</a>). Intact scaffolds were separated from excess staple strands using Amicon Ultra 100K cutoff spin columns (EMD Millipore). Purified scaffolds were mixed with excess labeled myosin, a mixture of 42-nt oligos with randomized sequences (blocking oligos), and 1\u20135 \u00b5M calmodulin in 1\u00d7 AB.BSA. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, excess streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (NEB) were added and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 10 min. The beads were washed with AB.BSA.CAM. Finally, the beads were incubated in AB.BSA.CAM containing an imaging solution of 2 mM ATP, 1 mM phosphocreatine, 0.1 mg/ml creatine-phosphokinase, 45 \u00b5g/ml catalase, 25 \u00b5g/ml glucose oxidase, 1\u20132% glucose, and excess elution strand for strand displacement of origami from streptavidin magnetic beads."

Motility assays were performed using plasma-cleaned rectangular capillary tubes (EMS, 75 mm \u00d7 50 \u03bcm \u00d7 1 \u03bcm). First, biotinylated, 488Alexa-phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments were immobilized to the inner surface of the capillary tube by BSA-biotin-neutravidin-linkages. Unbound actin filaments were washed with AB.BSA. Purified myosin-scaffold complexes in AB.BSA.CAM + imaging reagents (2 mM ATP, 1 mM phosphocreatine, 0.1 mg/ml creatine-phospho-kinase, 25 \u00b5g/ml glucose-oxidase, 45 \u00b5g/ml catalase, 1% glucose, 1 \u00b5M random library 42-nt ssDNA) were added to the capillary chamber.

A 2D-gaussian fit was used to estimate scaffold position with sub-pixel resolution. Intensity of scaffold was used to exclude scaffold dimers. Directional flux analysis was automated with custom-code in Mathematica (available at <a href=\"https://github.com/rizalhariadi/DirectionalAnalysis\">https://github.com/rizalhariadi/DirectionalAnalysis</a>). Analysis of directional scaffold movement was performed only to scaffold-myosin complexes that moved for more than 6 continuous frames (3 s) and covered a distance of more than 8 pixels (860 nm). For experiments on keratocytes, the directional trajectory was determined as follow. First, a local actin polarity vector was calculated for each trajectory (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hariadi et al., 2014</a>). Then, the movement direction for each trajectory was the calculated by comparing two Euclidian distances along the actin polarity field vector; (1) distance between starting point and cell periphery, <i>\u2206x</i><sub><i>start</i></sub>, and (2) distance between finish point and cell periphery, <i>\u2206x</i><sub><i>finish</i></sub>.

We sincerely apologize for the confusion, as it is evident that the original submission was unclear in its description of rationale and methodology.
