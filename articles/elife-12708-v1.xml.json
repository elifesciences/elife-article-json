Some journals had special sections for short articles that challenged papers published in the journal, but many of these journals seemed reluctant to publish such challenges (and they took a long time to publish those challenges that were accepted for publication). Over the past decade, however, researchers have turned to other platforms to comment on and criticize papers that have been published in journals. These platforms include blogs and third-party websites such as PubMed Commons and PubPeer. A number of journals also allow readers to post comments at the end of articles."

By neglecting these comments we are missing an opportunity to reduce the time and resources that are spent trying to repeat and build on experiments that are not reproducible (<a href=\"#bib1\">Freedman et al., 2015</a>)."

Three recent scientific controversies\u2014the report that a bacterial DNA sample contains arsenic instead of phosphorous, the report that RNA sequences contain widespread edits/changes from the corresponding DNA sequences, and the report of stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP)\u2014show that post-publication comments offer a fast and efficient method for raising concerns about potential problems in published papers. Criticisms of the arsenic life paper were first raised on blogs shortly after it was published online in <i>Science</i> in December 2010 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Wolfe-Simon et al., 2011</a>), and the journal subsequently published eight Technical Comments expressing concern about the paper in May 2011. Bloggers started to ask questions about the RNA paper, which was published in <i>Science</i> in May 2011 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Li et al., 2011</a>), shortly after publication (<a href=\"#bib8\">Pickrell, 2011</a>), and the journal subsequently published three Technical Comments about the paper in March 2012 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Hayden, 2012</a>). Concerns about the two STAP papers, which were published in <i>Nature</i> in January 2014 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Obokata et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2014b</a>), were raised immediately on PubPeer and blogs (<a href=\"#bib11\">The Niche, 2014</a>), and both papers were retracted in July 2014."

There have also been lengthy and sometimes heated/acrimonious debates on blogs about papers on topics as diverse as network inference/deconvolution algorithms (<a href=\"#bib3\">Kellis, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Pachter, 2014</a>) and stripy nanoparticles (<a href=\"#bib10\">Stirling, 2015</a>). Since these debates are not moderated and do not result in any sort of conclusion, they can be confusing for readers who are not experts in the subject being discussed. As a result, as someone who has developed network inference algorithms, I am often asked for my opinion on post-publication debates in this area. I believe that input from editors would be of great value in such cases."

However, I feel that many of the legitimate concerns about papers that are being raised in blogs and other platforms are being ignored by journals, so there is a clear need to make sure that comments that satisfy some basic criteria (see below) are acted upon by journals. The peer review process, the reproducibility of published results, and the scientific community as a whole stand to benefit tremendously from a more inclusive consideration of post-publication comments. Here I propose how this might work."

Authors and journals alike might be reluctant to commit to spending more time on a paper that has been published, especially if the paper had to be revised a number of times during the peer review process, but both have to take responsibility for the research they publish, and this should extend to dealing with substantive and legitimate questions and concerns. Online post-publication discussions about papers are becoming more frequent, and I believe this trend will continue. Authors and journals must get involved in these discussions for the benefit of all concerned."
