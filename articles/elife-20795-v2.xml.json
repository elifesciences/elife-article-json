AMPK, a key sensor of metabolic stress stabilizes cell-cell junctions and maintains epithelial polarity; its activation by Metformin protects the epithelial barrier against stress and suppresses tumorigenesis. How AMPK protects the epithelium remains unknown. Here, we identify GIV/Girdin as a novel effector of AMPK, whose phosphorylation at a single site is both necessary and sufficient for strengthening mammalian epithelial tight junctions and preserving cell polarity and barrier function in the face of energetic stress. Expression of an oncogenic mutant of GIV (cataloged in TCGA) that cannot be phosphorylated by AMPK increased anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells and helped these cells to evade the tumor-suppressive action of Metformin. This work defines a fundamental homeostatic mechanism by which the AMPK-GIV axis reinforces cell junctions against stress-induced collapse and also provides mechanistic insight into the tumor-suppressive action of Metformin."

AMPK, a key sensor of metabolic stress stabilizes cell-cell junctions and maintains epithelial polarity; its activation by Metformin protects the epithelial barrier against stress and suppresses tumorigenesis. How AMPK protects the epithelium remains unknown. Here, we identify GIV/Girdin as a novel effector of AMPK, whose phosphorylation at a single site is both necessary and sufficient for strengthening mammalian epithelial tight junctions and preserving cell polarity and barrier function in the face of energetic stress. Expression of an oncogenic mutant of GIV (cataloged in TCGA) that cannot be phosphorylated by AMPK increased anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells and helped these cells to evade the tumor-suppressive action of Metformin. This work defines a fundamental homeostatic mechanism by which the AMPK-GIV axis reinforces cell junctions against stress-induced collapse and also provides mechanistic insight into the tumor-suppressive action of Metformin."

                        "text": "Besides the pathways mentioned above, regulation of polarity requires an additional signaling component which is triggered exclusively under conditions of energetic stress. Three studies (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lee et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Zheng and Cantley, 2007</a>) published in 2006\u20132007 simultaneously reported a surprising role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the maintenance of epithelial cell polarity and barrier functions. Discovered in 1984, AMPK is unique in that it is a metabolic sensor protein which is activated during energetic stress and thereby, couples energy sensing to cell polarity by protecting cell junctions against stress-induced collapse. Using the polarized Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cell line (<i>MDCK</i>), it was demonstrated that AMPK is activated during calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)-induced tight junction (TJ) assembly (<a href=\"#bib101\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Zheng and Cantley, 2007</a>). Depletion of the AMPK catalytic \u03b1 subunit or expression of a kinase-dead mutant of AMPK inhibits TJ assembly as indicated by a loss of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER); the latter is a measure of paracellular ion flow which depends on TJ stability. Activation of AMPK with 5-aminoimidizole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) partially protects TJs from disassembly induced by calcium depletion (<a href=\"#bib101\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Zheng and Cantley, 2007</a>). These findings closely followed another major revelation that the tumor suppressor LKB1 (Liver Kinase B1; also known as Serine/Threonine Kinase 11 \u2013 STK11) is a direct activator of AMPK (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hawley et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hong et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Shaw et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Woods et al., 2003</a>), and that polarity defects precede the development of tumors in genetically modified mice with tissue-specific deletion of LKB1 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hezel et al., 2008</a>). Together, these discoveries established the first links between energetic stress, cell polarity and oncogenesis. Since then, multiple studies have reported the protective role of AMPK in maintaining cell-cell junctions across a variety of cell types in diverse tissue types [lung (<a href=\"#bib24\">Garnett et al., 2013</a>), heart (<a href=\"#bib10\">Castanares-Zapatero et al., 2013</a>), the blood-brain barrier (<a href=\"#bib51\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Takata et al., 2013</a>), kidney (<a href=\"#bib76\">Seo-Mayer et al., 2011</a>), intestine (<a href=\"#bib82\">Spruss et al., 2012</a>)] while mounting a pathologic response to a variety of stressors, from bacterial invasion (<a href=\"#bib67\">Patkee et al., 2016</a>) to ischemia (<a href=\"#bib76\">Seo-Mayer et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "Although there is a wide consensus on the role of the LKB1-AMPK axis and in particular AMPK's role in reinforcing TJs and preserving cell polarity during adverse environmental changes, it remains largely unknown how this kinase actually accomplishes this. One study suggested that muscle myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) may be the effector of AMPK during energetic stress in the fly (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lee et al., 2007</a>), but those findings have since come into question (<a href=\"#bib77\">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</a>) because the phosphosites on MRLC do not conform to the optimal AMPK substrate motif found in all other established in vivo AMPK substrates. Furthermore, subsequent studies have demonstrated that the LKB1/AMPK pathway is <i>not required for</i> the maintenance of polarity during energetic stress in either flies (<a href=\"#bib31\">Haack et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mirouse et al., 2013</a>) or fish (<a href=\"#bib90\">van der Velden and Haramis, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">van der Velden et al., 2011</a>). Thus, despite the fact that it has been a decade since the first studies revealed AMPK's ability to preserve the epithelial architecture and function in the setting of energetic stress, effectors of AMPK that orchestrate these functions have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that the multimodular polarity scaffold protein GIV (G-alpha interacting vesicle associated protein, a.k.a.

To investigate if AMPK binds GIV, we used two complementary approaches. First, co-immunoprecipitation assays using Cos7 cells expressing myc-tagged AMPK\u03b12 confirmed that GIV co-immunoprecipitates with AMPK (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Second, GST-pulldown assays confirmed that the N-terminal 440 aa of GIV [which contains the residue S245] is sufficient for binding AMPK\u03b12 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These results demonstrate that GIV binds AMPK\u03b1 both in vitro and in cells\u00a0and that the interaction is mediated via GIV's N-terminus."

Autoradiographs of\u00a0in vitro kinase assays carried out using \u03b3P-<i>32 ATP,</i> recombinant AMPK\u03b12 heterotrimers and bacterially expressed N-terminal fragment (aa 1\u2013440) of GIV showed that AMPK phosphorylates GST-GIV-NT WT (1\u2013440 aa) but not a non-phosphorylatable mutant protein in which the Ser at 245 is mutated to Ala (A) (S245A; henceforth referred to as SA) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Identical results were obtained when in vitro\u00a0kinase assays were carried out as above, except by replacing \u03b3P-<i>32 ATP with</i> non-radioactive ATP and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-pS245-GIV antibody (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). The phospho-specific antibody also showed a high degree of specificity; it did not detect non-phosphorylated GIV-WT or the phosphomimicking mutant in which S245 is mutated to Asp(D) (S245D; henceforth referred to as SD) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). To confirm if AMPK phosphorylates GIV at S245 in cells, we carried out in\u00a0cellulo kinase assays in cells coexpressing both GIV-FLAG (substrate) and myc-AMPK\u03b1 (kinase). Because AMPK is activated by increasing concentrations of AMP during metabolic stress induced by glucose starvation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hardie, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Tzatsos and Tsichlis, 2007</a>), we triggered activation of AMPK by growing the cells in glucose-free medium prior to lysis and by immunoprecipitating GIV and analyzing it for phosphorylation at S245 by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Phosphorylation of GIV at S245 was detected exclusively in the glucose-starved cells expressing GIV-WT, but not in those expressing GIV-SA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). That AMPK is required for phosphorylation of GIV at S245 after energetic stress was further confirmed using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs); such phosphorylation was induced by glucose deprivation in control MEFs, but not in MEFs derived from AMPK-/- mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). These results demonstrate that AMPK phosphorylates GIV at S245 in vitro and in cells. Furthermore, a homology model of GIV's N-terminal sequence bound to the catalytic \u03b1-subunit of AMPK generated using a previously solved crystal structure of CagA in complex with the AMPK-related kinase, MARK2 [PDB: 3IEC (<a href=\"#bib61\">Nesic et al., 2010</a>)], showed that the residues within and flanking S245 and the consensus substrate recognition sequence are compatible with AMPK's ability to bind and phosphorylate GIV at Ser 245 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>)."

We studied this by carrying out immunofluorescence studies on monolayers of Type II MDCK cells which are a widely used cell-based model system to study epithelial cell polarity, junctional integrity and epithelial morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dukes et al., 2011</a>). Type II MDCK cells have been used as the primary model system in the initial studies that revealed the role of AMPK in the stabilization of TJs (<a href=\"#bib100\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Zheng and Cantley, 2007</a>). While GIV was not detected at cell-cell contact sites in fully polarized domed MDCK monolayers at steady-state under basal (normoglycemic) conditions, it localized transiently to cell-cell junctions during energetic stress (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Active AMPK also localized transiently to cell-cell contact sites exclusively after energetic stress at specialized zones of the TJs, called tricellular TJs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). pS245-GIV was not detected at the cell-cell contact sites either in\u00a0isolated single cells or in fully polarized domed MDCK monolayers under normal glucose conditions, but localized to the cell-cell junctions transiently when single cells assembled junctions during the course of their growth into confluent monolayers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Although pS245-GIV was not detected at the junctions of fully polarized domed monolayers, it was prominently detected once the monolayers were subjected to energetic stress with glucose starvation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). pS245-GIV was also readily detected at cell-cell junctions when domed monolayers were exposed to low-calcium states with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator EGTA, indicating that such localization is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent. Both conditions, i.e., low-calcium states (EGTA-induced) and energetic stress states (induced by glucose deprivation) were accompanied by activation of AMPK (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Using cross-sections of Z-stacked images of MDCK cells treated with EGTA, we confirmed that pS245-GIV colocalizes preferentially with Occludin, a marker of tight junctions (TJs), and only occasionally with \u03b2-Catenin, a marker of adherens junctions (AJs) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These results demonstrate that pS245-GIV preferentially localizes to the TJs and that such localization is seen exclusively during TJ turnover; localization is seen both during TJ assembly as cells come in contact to form a monolayer and during TJ-disassembly as monolayers collapse in response to energetic stress or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depletion. These findings raise the possibility that pS245-GIV may serve as one of the effectors of AMPK at the TJs which enables the kinase to enhance junctional stability exclusively during stress-induced junction turnover. That little or no pS245-GIV was observed at cell-cell contact sites in fully polarized domed monolayers at steady-state indicates one of the two possibilities: (i) the AMPK-GIV axis, of which pS245-GIV is a product, may not have a role at the TJs under physiologic conditions, but is required to fortify TJs exclusively under conditions of energetic stress, or (ii) pS245-GIV may be required for the maintenance of TJs, but cannot be detected because of rapid dephosphorylation and a short half-life at the junctions. Finally, that GIV-SA expressing cells have normal TEER at steady-state (no energetic stress, normal calcium, normal serum; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), but fail to 'recover' TEER when they are returned to NCM growth conditions after an initial exposure to LCM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) suggests that in the absence of the AMPK-GIV axis energetic stress and disassembly of junctions triggered by low calcium may set in motion some yet unknown pathways in an irreversible manner, perhaps culminating in detachment and/or apoptosis."

Expression of GIV was significantly reduced (~by 80\u201385%) in Type II MDCK cells, which present 'leakier' junctions compared to Type I MDCK cells (<a href=\"#bib73\">Rothen-Rutishauser et al., 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Such low levels of GIV expression have previously been reported by others [GIV in MDCK II cells could be detected by immunoblotting exclusively after enrichment by immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sasaki et al., 2015</a>)]. Despite multiple attempts at depleting the residual low amounts of GIV by shRNA (lentiviral vectors), we failed to generate cell lines stably and reliably depleted of GIV, suggesting that the already low levels of endogenous GIV may be essential for the survival of MDCK cells in monolayer cultures. As an alternative approach, to study how phosphorylation of GIV at S245 affects cell polarity we generated MDCK II cell lines stably expressing FLAG-tagged full length GIV constructs at levels ~ 2 to 3 -fold above the low levels of the endogenous protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>): GIV-WT (which models the physiologic state allowing cycles of phospho-dephosphorylation at S245); the non-phosphorylatable SA (which models the constitutively dephosphorylated state); the phosphomimicking SD mutants (which models the constitutively phosphorylated state at S245). The functional integrity of TJs, as determined by measuring paracellular permeability of ions assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) across fully polarized domed monolayers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) were similar between the parental and various Type II MDCK-GIV stable cell lines at steady-state (normal glucose and calcium); as expected, all of them were significantly 'leakier' than Type I MDCK cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). However, when these cells were exposed to low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> media (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) or deprived of glucose (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) the drop in TEER when was significantly more across MDCK-GIV-SA monolayers and significantly less across MDCK-GIV-SD monolayers compared to MDCK-GIV-WT. When normocalcemic conditions were restored, MDCK-GIV-WT and SD cells regained their baseline TEER, whereas MDCK-GIV-SA cells did not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). The MDCK-GIV-SD monolayers also showed a smaller drop in TEER (25%, compared to 50% in MDCK-GIV-WT monolayers) when exposed to EGTA (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), whereas the MDCK-GIV-SA monolayers failed to regain their TEER as efficiently as MDCK-GIV-WT cells after a Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). These findings indicate that although all MDCK-GIV cell lines make stable TJs in normal growth conditions, the MDCK-GIV-SA monolayers are more vulnerable and the MDCK-GIV-SD monolayers are more resilient to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depletion or energetic stress compared to GIV-WT cells."

Under normoglycemic and normocalcemic conditions, MDCK-GIV cell lines were indistinguishable from the parental Type II cells and from each other. They all grew into confluent monolayers of fully polarized cells with intact TJs and AJs, as determined by immunofluorescence studies looking at the localization of Occludin (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), E-Cadherin, ZO-1 or \u03b2-Catenin (data not shown). However, clear differences emerged when the localization of TJ and AJ proteins were analyzed in these cells after exposing them to conditions that trigger disassembly of cell-cell junctions by either depriving them of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (with EGTA; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) or by subjecting them to energetic stress (by glucose starvation; <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Both conditions revealed the early disruption of TJs and AJs and increased vulnerability of MDCK-GIV-SA cells compared to control MDCK parental cells or the MDCK-GIV-WT cells. These cells exhibited increased actin remodeling and formed stress fibers compared to control or GIV-WT cells, indicative of junctional instability, loss of polarity and cell-flattening (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). By contrast, the MDCK-GIV-SD cells were more resilient, in that junctional markers localized to cell-cell junctions despite prolonged exposure to conditions that disrupt junctions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4s5\">5</a>). These findings indicate that an interruption in the AMPK-GIV axis during energetic stress, as modeled in the MDCK-GIV-SA cells in which AMPK cannot phosphorylate S245 on GIV, made junctions more vulnerable, leakier, and triggered loss of cell polarity. Under the same set of conditions hyperactivation of the AMPK-GIV axis, as modeled in the MDCK-GIV-SD cells which mimics constitutive phosphorylation at S245 on GIV, resisted stress-induced loss of junctional integrity and preserved barrier functions and cell polarity in the face of stress. We conclude that phosphorylation of GIV at S245 by AMPK is largely dispensable under normal growth conditions but essential for TJ integrity exclusively during energetic stress. This single phosphoevent not only resists stress-induced junctional collapse, but also favors their reassembly during recovery."

When cultivated in 3D collagen matrix, which limits the availability of glucose, nutrients and oxygen by diffusion only, MDCK cells with intact polarity pathways form cysts comprised of polarized cells lining a single central lumen (<a href=\"#bib65\">O'Brien et al., 2002</a>). When one or more of the polarity pathways are disrupted, cysts display abnormal features, e.g., deformed or multiple lumens, elongated structures, tubules or other abnormal shapes or sizes. MDCK-parental and MDCK-GIV-WT cells morphed into cysts with a single central lumen and infrequently into small tubular structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013J</a>). MDCK-GIV-SD cells formed cysts that were consistently smaller in diameter (by ~30\u201340%) with a smooth edged central lumen (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>), but with a notable absence of tubular structures. By contrast, MDCK-GIV-SA cells morphed into larger cysts invariably featuring multiple lumens and abundant complex branched tubular structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,J</a>). These data indicate that phosphorylation on GIV S245 is a key determinant of normal epithelial morphogenesis-- phosphorylation favors polarized normal cysts, whereas absence of phosphorylation favors branching tubules and multi-lumen structures that are associated with loss of cell polarity."

We used these modulators of AMPK on the MDCK-GIV stable cell lines to investigate if the previously observed role of AMPK in the protection of epithelial TJs is mediated via its ability to phosphorylate GIV at S245. If such phosphorylation is essential, we expected that pre-treatment of monolayers with AMPK agonists AICAR or Metformin would not protect TJs formed by MDCK-GIV-SA cells no matter how efficiently AMPK is activated. Conversely, we expected that treatment of monolayers with the AMPK inhibitor Compound C would not disrupt TJs assembled by MDCK-GIV-SD cells, in which the need for AMPK has been bypassed by expression of a mutant that mimics constitutive activation of the pathway. We found such is indeed the case because compared to MDCK-GIV-WT cells, the loss of functional integrity of TJs (as determined by a drop in TEER) after short (2\u00a0hr) exposures to Compound C was significantly less in MDCK-GIV-SD cells and greater in MDCK-GIV-SA cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). As anticipated, the protective actions of Metformin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) or AICAR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) on TJs of cells exposed to low Ca<sup>2+</sup> media was seen in MDCK-GIV-WT, but not in MDCK-GIV-SA cells. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that the increased susceptibility and resilience of GIV-SA and GIV-SD cells, respectively, to the AMPK inhibitor Compound C correlate with the early and late loss of structural integrity of TJs and AJs, as determined by the loss of localization of junctional proteins from cell-cell contact sites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Prolonged exposure of monlayers to Compound C showed that MDCK-GIV-SD cells continue to stay attached as monolayers, long after MDCK-GIV-WT and SA cell lines have detached and floated in clumps of dead cells, indicating that the GIV-SD cell line is relatively insensitive to the AMPK-inhibitor Compound C (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The findings in the MDCK-GIV-SA cells indicate that phosphorylation of GIV at S245 is required for the protective actions of AMPK activators on TJ integrity. The findings in the MDCK-GIV-SD cells indicate that phosphorylation of GIV at S245 is sufficient for offering protection against and escaping the disruptive actions of AMPK inhibitors on TJs (see schematic and legend; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Because Compound C, the only available cell permeable effective inhibitor of AMPK can also inhibit other kinases besides AMPK (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bain et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Vogt et al., 2011</a>), there is a possibility that GIV may interplay with kinases other than AMPK to maintain TJ integrity. We conclude that pS245-GIV, which is generated only when the AMPK-GIV axis is intact, is both necessary and sufficient to fortify TJs, avoid junctional collapse and preserve cell polarity in the face of energetic stress. We further conclude that a significant part of the junction-stabilizing effects of AMPK agonists AICAR and Metformin during energetic stress (<a href=\"#bib101\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Zheng and Cantley, 2007</a>) are mediated by AMPK via its downstream effector, pS245-GIV."

First, we ruled out a significant impact of phosphorylation at S245 on GIV's ability to homodimerize (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Then, we focused on the impact of such phosphorylation on GIV's ability to associate with microtubules. 3D reconstruction of deconvolved confocal images showed that pS245-GIV colocalized with and followed the bundles of polymerized microtubule tracks at the cell-cell borders (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). More importantly, pS245-GIV exclusively laced those microtubule tracks that ran along cell-cell junctions (arrowheads; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and not those that were found on the free-borders of the cells (arrows; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). RGB plot analyses revealed two distinct patterns: (1) pS245-GIV overlaying individual microtubule tracks (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>); and (2) pS245-GIV in the middle of two parallel microtubule tracks ('linker' pattern; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>). These findings indicate that pS245-GIV colocalizes with junction-associated microtubules and raise the possibility that the phosphoevent may impact GIV's ability to bind \u03b1- and/or \u03b2-tubulin heterodimers."

                                "text": "The structure of microtubules shows that the last \u223c100 amino acids of \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin project from the surface of the MT primarily as two helices (<a href=\"#bib63\">Nogales et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Nogales et al., 1998</a>). We hypothesized that GIV might engage the free C-termini of tubulin monomers, as has been previously demonstrated in the case of the AMPK-substrate CLIP-170 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Mishima et al., 2007</a>). We prepared recombinant GST fusion proteins representing the C-terminal ~100 amino acids of \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) and used them in GST pulldown assays. These assays revealed that full length GIV preferentially bound the C-terminus of \u03b1-, but not \u03b2-Tubulin, and that this interaction is increased during energetic stress (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using bacterially expressed N-terminal GIV constructs (aa 1\u2013440) that were phosphorylated in vitro with AMPK, we confirmed that the GIV\u25cfTubulin interaction has two key properties: (i) it occurs between GIV's N-terminus and prefers the C-terminus of \u03b1-Tubulin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>); (ii) it requires GIV to be phosphorylated at S245 by AMPK (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B</a>). Tubulin co-sedimentation assays further confirmed that energetic stress favors the association of GIV with polymerized, sedimentable microtubules (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D</a>), and that phosphorylation at S245 (mimicked by the GIV-SD mutation) is sufficient to enhance such association (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013F</a>). These findings demonstrate that phosphorylation at S245 by AMPK impacts GIV's ability to bind \u03b1-tubulin and associate with polymerized microtubules. Taken together with our findings by confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), we conclude that energetic stress triggers pS245-GIV to specifically bind the junction-associated microtubule tracks. Because AMPK regulates post-translational modifications on the C-terminus of \u03b1-Tubulin during energetic stress (<a href=\"#bib36\">Herms et al., 2015</a>) and because it is capable of stimulating microtubule polymerization specifically at the cell periphery [via phosphorylation of the plus end protein, CLIP-170 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Nakano et al., 2010</a>)], it is possible that either or both of those phenomena play a role in restricting pS245-GIV to associate exclusively with the junction-associated microtubule tracks. Although further experiments will be needed to shed light on these mechanisms, the results presented in this work and the published literature to date support the following model (see legend <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>): Energetic stress triggers AMPK signaling and phosphorylation of GIV at S245, pS245-GIV localizes to TJs, the N-terminus of GIV binds \u03b1-tubulin and junction-associated microtubule tracks. It is here that GIV may subsequently impact cell polarity and junctional integrity by assembling various functional complexes with its C-terminus, i.e., by (i) binding the Par3/Par6/aPKC polarity complex (<a href=\"#bib66\">Ohara et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Sasaki et al., 2015</a>); (ii) binding and modulating the endocytic trafficking of E-cadherin (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ichimiya et al., 2015</a>); (iii) linking cadherin-catenin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib41\">Houssin et al., 2015</a>); and finally, (iv) binding and activating G protein, G\u03b1i via its GEF motif and maintaining epithelial polarity through the Par polarity complex (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sasaki et al., 2015</a>). Each of these functional associations of GIV have been implicated in the generation of cell polarity."

Exposure of epithelial cells to conditions that induce energetic stress result in depletion of cellular ATP stores and accumulation of AMP (step 1); the latter activates AMPK kinase (step 2). Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates GIV at S245 (step 3) triggering its localization to the cell-cell junction (TJs) via increased ability to bind TJ-associated microtubules (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lee et al., 2007</a>) (step 4). Once localized to the cell-cell junctions, GIV has been shown (<a href=\"#bib41\">Houssin et al., 2015</a>) to bind AJ-localized protein complexes, e.g., \u03b1- and \u03b2-Catenins and E-cadherin and links the catenin-cadherin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton (steps 5 and 8).

                                "text": "Next, we asked how the AMPK-GIV stress-polarity pathway impacts cancer cell growth. Most cancers are epithelial in origin, and the loss of cell polarity is a critical step that fuels both malignant transformation and metastatic progression (<a href=\"#bib17\">Forcet and Billaud, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mirouse and Billaud, 2011</a>). While activation of AMPK may allow healthy cells to tide over short periods of energetic stress by preserving cell polarity and temporarily restraining energy consumption and growth, tumor cells are known to establish mechanisms to survive prolonged periods of energetic stress by down-regulating AMPK signaling and escaping its restraining influences on growth. To dissect the role of the AMPK-GIV axis, and specifically, pS245-GIV on growth properties of cancer cells, we queried the comprehensive catalogs of genetic mutations identified by genome sequencing, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) databases. A search of both databases revealed that the sequence within and flanking the AMPK-consensus site is frequently mutated (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While many of those mutations were predicted by computational modeling to have various degrees of impact on the GIV-AMPK\u03b1 interaction (see legend, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we chose to characterize one recurrent mutation, L249P (four residues downstream from S245) which was found in two different colorectal tumors. The residue L249 is a key part of the consensus sequence (FxR/KxxS/Txxx<b>L</b>) that is recognized by AMPK\u03b1 and likely makes a large contribution to the binding energy because it is predicted to be buried in a hydrophobic pocket on AMPK\u03b1. Computational modeling analyses predicted that when L249 is substituted with a Proline (P) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) a H-bond between L249 and S184 on AMPK will be lost, the Pro will not be able to sit within the hydrophobic pocket where L249 lies, and instead poses a steric clash (see legend; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Thus, the L249P mutation (henceforth referred to as LP) was predicted to abolish AMPK\u03b1's ability to recognize GIV as a substrate. As predicted, AMPK failed to phosphorylate the GIV-LP mutant as efficiently as GIV-WT either in vitro (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) or in cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), much like the SA mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). When expressed in MDCK cells, this mutant recapitulated the key phenotypes we observed previously with the non-phosphorylatable GIV-SA mutant, i.e., defective restoration of TJ integrity after Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch, as determined by measurement of TEER (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>) and defective epithelial morphogenesis, as determined by the formation of abnormal multi-luminal large cysts and abundant tubules in 3D cystogenesis assays (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). These results demonstrate that the L249P mutant of GIV found in colorectal tumors is not phosphorylatable by AMPK, and its expression in MDCK cells is associated with leakier TJs, disruption of cell polarity and abnormal epithelial morphogenesis."

                                "text": "We hypothesized that GIV-LP may represent a mechanism present in tumor cells that specifically disrupts the AMPK-GIV axis, uncouples energy sensing from cell polarity pathways and thereby, evades the growth restraining effects of AMPK. To test this hypothesis, we generated DLD1 colorectal carcinoma cell lines stably expressing GIV-WT, LP, or the various mutants used in this study and assessed their ability to grow into colonies in a three-dimensional (3D) spatial conformation within soft agar matrix. We chose this cell line because the LP mutant was found in colorectal cancers. The 3D colony-formation assay recreates in culture the typical 3D architecture of the tumor tissue and heterogeneously exposes cancer cells to diffusion-limited glucose, oxygen and nutrients and to other physical and chemical stresses (<a href=\"#bib96\">Weiswald et al., 2015</a>) at the tumor core during the early periods of avascular growth. We found that compared to parental DLD1 and DLD1-GIV-WT cells, colony formation was enhanced in those expressing the non-phosphorylatable SA or LP mutants but suppressed in the DLD1-GIV-SD cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F\u2013G</a>). These growth patterns were reversed when tumor cells are homogeneously exposed to unlimited oxygen, nutrients, metabolites, and signaling molecules in 2D anchorage-dependent colony growth assays (<a href=\"#bib96\">Weiswald et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H\u2013I</a>); compared to DLD1-GIV-WT cells, DLD1-GIV-SA and LP cells lost the growth advantage previously seen in 3D and showed reduced 2D growth, whereas the DLD-GIV-SD cells overcame the growth suppressive effects previously seen in 3D and showed enhanced 2D growth. These findings indicate that the growth-enhancing effect of GIV-SA or GIV-LP and the growth-suppressive effect of GIV-SD are restricted to conditions mimicked by anchorage-independent growth in 3D. Those effects were also seen in 3D growth of Ras-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8J</a>), indicating that the AMPK-GIV axis may in part be responsible for mediating the previously observed growth suppressive action of AMPK in this model system (<a href=\"#bib62\">Ng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Phoenix et al., 2012</a>). These results indicate that disruption of the AMPK-GIV signaling axis (mimicked by GIV-SA or LP) favors anchorage-independent 3D growth, whereas constitutive activation of the pathway (mimicked by GIV-SD) prevents such growth. We conclude that AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of GIV at S245 restricts epithelial cell growth to anchorage-dependent conditions via its ability to protect the epithelium from stress-induced junctional collapse, but fails to grow without anchorage, presumably because of death (anoikis) when anchorage is lost. Tumor cells expressing GIV mutants that cannot be phosphorylated by AMPK evade this protective mechanism."

We asked if the growth suppressive action of AMPK agonists requires an intact AMPK-GIV signaling axis. Anchorage-independent growth assays were carried out using various DLD1-GIV cell lines in the presence of increasing doses of AICAR or Metformin. As expected, both AMPK agonists effectively suppressed the growth of parental DLD1 and DLD1-GIV-WT cells in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013B</a>), whereas the growth of DLD1-GIV-SA and LP cells was only mildly suppressed and only at higher doses. These findings indicate that phosphorylation of GIV at S245 by AMPK is essential for the growth suppressive actions of AMPK agonists. We conclude that anti-proliferative actions of AMPK agonists like Metformin is mediated at least in part via the AMPK-GIV signaling axis. These findings, along with the findings in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig8\">8</a> support the following model: In normal epithelial cells in which the AMPK-GIV axis is intact (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>) pS245-GIV serves as a major effector of AMPK at the TJs, inhibits stress-induced junctional collapse, preserves cell polarity, and the epithelial barrier functions to tide over stress events. Under these conditions, AMPK agonists restrict epithelial cell growth to anchorage-dependent conditions. In\u00a0tumor cells in which the AMPK-GIV axis is disrupted (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>) TJs are vulnerable to stress-induced collapse, cells lose polarity and overcome the need for anchorage for growth. Under these conditions, anchorage-independent growth is favored, which initiates and sustains cancer growth, and AMPK agonists are rendered ineffective."

                                "text": "Findings showcased in this work help draw three major conclusions. The first conclusion is that the polarity scaffold protein GIV is a direct target and an effector of the energy-sensing kinase AMPK; phosphorylation of GIV at a single site is necessary and sufficient to mediate the junction-stabilizing functions of AMPK in the normal epithelium. In doing so, this work has revealed an elusive link between the stress-sensing components and the cell polarity pathways (see legend, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>), and improved our understanding of molecular mechanisms of how epithelial monolayers are protected despite being constantly bombarded by energetic stressors by fortifying cell-cell junctions against stress-induced collapse. Because GIV serves as a junctional scaffold in both epithelial (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sasaki et al., 2015</a>) and endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ichimiya et al., 2015</a>), it is possible that the stress-triggered mechanisms outlined here also account for the protective role of AMPK on cell junctions observed consistently in a variety of tissue and cell types, in both epithelial (<a href=\"#bib24\">Garnett et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Patkee et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Seo-Mayer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Spruss et al., 2012</a>) and endothelial (<a href=\"#bib10\">Castanares-Zapatero et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Takata et al., 2013</a>) cells, in the face of diverse chemical, bacterial and metabolic stressors. Given the overlapping substrate specificity of AMPK and its related kinases [reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib77\">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</a>)], it seems likely that AMPK-related family members such as the MARKs, may phosphorylate S245 on GIV under other conditions or in specific tissues. Because GIV is a GEF for trimeric G proteins (<a href=\"#bib21\">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</a>), and because GIV's ability to trigger G\u03b1i signaling is essential for cell polarity (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sasaki et al., 2015</a>), it is possible that localized GIV-dependent G-protein signaling at the cell-cell junctions triggered by energetic stress may modulate cellular stress response via G-protein intermediates."

The clusters of functional associations shown here are meant to be specific and meaningful, i.e. proteins jointly contribute to a shared function; this does not necessarily mean they are physically binding each other. The interaction network shows that GIV (CCDC88A) functions as a key polarity-determinant scaffold which links major components that sense cellular energy (STK11, LKB1; PRKA, AMPK) and determine cellular growth and survival responses (on the left) and signaling pathways, e.g., Wnt (top; light blue) and growth factor and integrin pathways (purple; bottom) that dictate anchorage-dependent vs independent growth in normal and transformed cells, respectively, to cell-cell junctions (both tight and adherens; on the right). The microtubule stability determinants (upper left; dark blue) are likely to synergize with the AMPK-GIV axis for protecting junctions against stress-induced collapse. Two previously defined functional interactions of PRKA (AMPK) studied in different contexts stand out as key links: (1) Phosphorylation of the microtubule plus end protein CLIP-170 (CLIP1; deep blue) by AMPK enhances the speed of microtubule polymerization (<a href=\"#bib60\">Nakano et al., 2010</a>); and (2) Phosphorylation of the TJ- protein cingulin (CGN; green) by <i>AMPK</i> increases the association of plus ends of microtubules with TJs (<a href=\"#bib99\">Yano et al., 2013</a>). Key at the lower left corner indicates how each functional interaction within this network was color-coded."

These conclusions are in keeping with prior observations that polarity defects precede the onset of tumorigenesis when the LKB1-AMPK pathway is inhibited (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hezel et\u00a0al., 2008</a>), fueling the speculation that polarity defects may be one of the major mechanisms for tumor initiation when the energy sensing pathway is dysregulated (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hezel and Bardeesy, 2008</a>). Multiple studies on GIV have demonstrated its role as a bona\u00a0fide metastasis-related protein across a variety of cancers, primarily via its ability to initiate and amplify tyrosine-based G protein signals (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aznar et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ghosh, 2016</a>) and couple it to actin cytoskeletal remodeling at the leading edge of migrating cells predominantly via interactions mediated by its C\u00a0terminus [reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ghosh, 2015</a>)]. This study is the first of its kind that reveals the protective role of GIV's N\u00a0terminus. Because loss of cell polarity is known to impact both early and later steps of oncogenic progression (<a href=\"#bib97\">Wodarz and Nathke, 2007</a>), it is possible that loss of cell polarity due to the disruption of the AMPK-GIV axis impacts not just the early phases of transformation and cancer growth, but also fuels cancer invasion into adjacent tissues and the formation of metastases."

Metformin (Glucophage), the most widely used type II diabetes drug in the world, reduces blood glucose by activating the LKB1-AMPK pathway (<a href=\"#bib79\">Shaw et al., 2005</a>) and inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis [reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib77\">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</a>)]. Besides its ability to lower blood glucose, Metformin also exerts two other effects in an AMPK-dependent manner: (i) it stabilizes cell-cell junctions and protects barrier functions of both epithelial and endothelial monolayers in the setting of a variety of pathologic stressors; and (ii) it suppresses the growth of a variety of tumor cells and embryonic stem cells in culture and tumor xenografts in mice [reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib77\">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</a>)]. By demonstrating that phosphorylation of GIV by AMPK is required for Metformin to exert both these effects efficiently, this work unravels that activation of AMPK, and more specifically, the AMPK-GIV signaling axis as an important mechanism of action of Metformin. It is noteworthy that although multiple retrospective clinical trials have generally concluded that prolonged use of Metformin reduces the incidence of cancer, others have reported conflicting results, and several prospective clinical trials are underway to identify which target populations may specifically benefit from this drug [reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kourelis and Siegel, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Pryor and Cabreiro, 2015</a>)]. Given the widespread long-term use of metformin as a prescription drug and its potential utility both in chemoprevention as well as chemotherapy, further studies are warranted to investigate if the GIV-expression status in tumors [e.g., its expression as a spliced isoform lacking the C\u00a0terminus (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ghosh et al., 2010</a>) or mutants that prevent phosphorylation by AMPK (current work), or its overexpression as full length (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ghosh et al., 2016</a>)] may help identify which patients may benefit from the tumor suppressive actions of the Metformin."

Whenever such energetic stress was used in various assays, activation of AMPK was confirmed by immunoblotting in each instance. Besides glucose deprivation, we also eliminated growth factors/serum in these assays.

Images were sequentially recorded with excitation wavelengths 405, 488 and 561 with the corresponding dichroic mirror. Z-stacks were acquired 0.2\u2009mm spacing, according to Nyquist with a size of 1024 x 1024 pixels. Images were processed using the 3D deconvolution and 3D reconstructions tools of the Olympus cellSens (version Dimension Desktop 1.15) software. Co-localization analysis was performed using single stack or maximum projection images with the use of public domain Java image processing program ImageJ (version 1.49v, http//imagej.nih.gov/ij). Crop images were further sharpened in ImageJ."

Briefly, microtubules were polymerized from whole-cell lysates of Cos7 cells transfected or not with WT-GIV, S245D-GIV or S245A-GIV. Cells were scraped off the tissue culture plates, and washed with chilled PBS. Of the cell pellet,\u00a010% were used for Triton-X lysis to monitor total amounts of protein evaluated (inputs). The pellet was then washed again in chilled PEM buffer (0.1\u2009M PIPES, 1\u2009mM EGTA, 1\u2009mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, pH 6.6) and lysed by Dounce homogenization in hypotonic buffer (1\u2009mM EGTA, 1\u2009mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, pH 6.6) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, DTT and Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>. After lysis, 0.1\u2009M PIPES (pH 6.6) was added and lysates were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min at 20,000X g. The supernatant was separated from the cell pellet and was then clarified by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 60\u2009min at 130,000X g. The supernatant was then incubated with 25 \u00b5M Docetaxel at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min in the presence of 1\u2009mM GTP to allow microtubules to polymerize. Microtubules were separated from soluble tubulin by centrifugation at room temperature for 30\u2009min at 17,000X g. The supernatant, containing soluble tubulin, was collected and supplemented with 5X sample buffer. The pellet, which contained polymerized microtubules, was gently washed with PEM buffer and resuspended in 4X sample buffer in PEM. Protein in the supernatant (S), input (I) and pellet (P) were analyzed by immunoblotting."

The genes and a subset of their neighbors were then extracted from the databases and reconstructed as an interaction network to highlight the major links between energy-sensing components, the junctional complex-associated genes, and the genes that provide input signals (growth factors, integrins and the Wnt pathway) for the assembly and disassembly of junctions. All splice isoforms, information regarding whether an interaction is stimulatory or inhibitory, or post-translational modifications are collapsed, i.e., each node represents all the proteins produced by a single, protein-coding gene locus, and each link represents some form of functional association."

It has previously been shown that activation of the AMPK kinase both facilitates tight junction assembly and stabilizes tight junctions, enhancing their resistance to factors such as energy deprivation that ordinarily lead to tight junction dissolution. The authors provide evidence indicating that GIV/Girdin is a substrate for AMPK activity. Using antibodies directed against GIV/Girdin and phosphoGIV/Girdin they show that GIV/Girdin and phosphoGIV/Girdin are not present at tight junctions at steady state. Under conditions that produce energy stress or that destabilize junctions, however, phosphoGIV/Girdin accumulates at sites of cell-cell contact. They further report that overexpression of phosphomimetic GIV/Girdin maintains junction integrity and TEER in the face of juncetion-perturbing stimuli, whereas this effect is not seen with overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable GIV/Girdin. The authors suggest that AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of GIV/Girdin constitutes the mechanism through which AMPK mediates its effects on junction stability. They find that phosphoGIV/Girdin is associated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner with microtubules that are organized along cell contact sites, and suggest that this microtubule association may play a role in the effects of GIV/Girdin on junction stability. Some tumors express a mutant form of GIV/Girdin that lacks the AMPK phosphorylation site. The authors suggest that AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of GIV/Girdin may act to link the regulation of cell growth to cell junction stability and that expression of this mutant form of GIV/Girdin might allow tumor cells to grow in an anchorage-independent fashion. They find that expression of phosphomimetic GIV/Girdin prevents anchorage independent growth, whereas expression of non-phosphorylatable GIV/Girdin does not prevent anchorage-independent growth. The data are generally strong and well presented. The figures are clear and well presented. There are, however, several points that should be addressed and questions that need to be answered."

We agree and have included in this revised submission the experiments suggested (see Responses #1 and #2 below) to implicate endogenous AMPK phosphorylates endogenous GIV under energetic stress, and that endogenous AMPK localizes to the TJs. As for our need to use of exogenously expressed GIV mutants in MDCK cell lines at levels equal amounts of WT endogenous GIV, we had addressed this technical limitation in detail in the subsection \u201cPhosphorylation of GIV at S245 is essential for junctional integrity and epithelial morphogenesis\u201d explaining why this was done, how we validated the cell lines to confirm that such expression did not affect the functional and structural integrity of junctions at steady-state."

We found that (phospho)-AMPK was not detected in fully polarized domed monolayers at steady-state grown in the presence of glucose (no energetic stress); however, when domed monolayers are subjected to 6 h of energetic stress [induced by glucose starvation] active AMPK was detected exclusively at the TJs of tricellular contact (tTJs), as determined by colocalization with Occludin where 3 or more cells come in contact. With prolonged energetic stress (i.e., 12 h of glucose starvation) tTJs were the first to disassemble and were associated with a blush of active AMPK. Longer duration of glucose starvation was associated with a loss of any specific signal for active AMPK.

We had compared and contrasted the two modes of growth [in 3D vs. 2D] precisely because one, i.e., 3D growth, but not 2D growth assay is known to recreate in culture the typical 3D architecture of the tumor tissue and heterogeneously exposes cancer cells to diffusion-limited glucose, oxygen and nutrients and to other physical and chemical stresses at the tumor core during the early periods of avascular growth. When we induced further energetic stress [by glucose starvation] of DLD1 cells in 3D growth, this led to complete growth arrest of all GIV-expressing stable cell lines tested, making it impossible to assess differences. This is not unexpected given the fact that these tumor cells, like all others, are chronically energy [ATP] depleted despite ~10-15 fold higher glucose consumption [i.e., Warburg effect]. Therefore, it is not surprising that glucose deprivation was incompatible with growth. We would like to point out that we have indeed carried out the experiment that is proposed here, but using a slightly different approach. Instead of glucose deprivation as a way to activate AMPK in these anchorage-independent growth assays, we activated AMPK with AICAR or Metformin, and those results were showcased in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> (panels 9A and 9B). It is certainly possible that we have misinterpreted the question, and if so, we are willing to explain/respond with further feasible experimentation."

This was the primary reason we invested in generating and validating a phosphospecific GIV antibody that can specifically detect the specialized pool of GIV at the TJs. We have confirmed that both SA and SD mutant GIV cannot be detected with anti-pS245GIV antibody [see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>], and hence, we did not use this antibody in the IF assays characterizing the role of phosphorylation of GIV at TJs using the various cell lines [<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5D</a>]; instead we just followed the disassembly of junctions using occludin and E-cadherin as markers of TJs and AJs, respectively."

We too have been perplexed by this observation. We believe that the prolonged delay in [almost lack of] recovery could be because the cells expressing the non-phosphorylatable GIV-SA mutant is expected to be defective in two conditions where we showed that the AMPK-GIV pathway is triggered: 1) when single cells come in contact and assemble TJs [see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, top two panels]; and 2) specifically at TJs subjected to Calcium or glucose deprivation [see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, lower three panels]. So, after the junctions are disassembled in GIV-SA cells [drop in TEER in low-calcium state] single cells must come together in normal calcium medium. However, because these cells are unable to phosphorylate GIV at S245 as single cells come together during the reformation of the monolayer, we believe that some of these cells just detach and die during the prolonged assay period [as seen in IF assays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) and by light microscopy (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>]. We speculate that energetic stress or disassembly of junctions due to low calcium may set in motion some yet unknown pathways in an irreversible manner after junctions are disassembled in the absence of the AMPK-GIV axis [in GIV-SA cells]."

He/she also rightly points out that in panel 5Dthe effect of Compound C on the structural integrity of TJs and AJs [as determined by IF] looks similar, i.e., in both cases junctional proteins are lost from cell-cell contact sites by 6h after treatment with Compound C. We would like to point out that TEER measurements had to be carried out with shorter periods of incubation [2 h], whereas IF assays were carried out with longer incubation [3, 6, 10 and 20 h]. Shorter incubations were necessary to see the early impairment in functional integrity [TEER] and tease out the differential sensitivity of WT and SA cells. Longer incubations in IF assays that were designed to look at structural integrity of TJs/AJs were more helpful to appreciate the resistance of GIV-SD cells, but were not sensitive enough to see early losses in functional integrity. In order to make sure that readers notice the difference of incubation times [which we mention in the labels for each Figure panel], we have now reinforced the short and prolonged exposures in the subsection \u201cStabilization of tight junctions by AMPK requires phosphorylation of GIV at S245\u201d, just so that readers understand that the data is consistent overall."
