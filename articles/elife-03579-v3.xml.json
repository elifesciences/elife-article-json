Detailed structures of antiporters with bound substrate ions are essential for understanding how they work. We have resolved the substrate ion in the dimeric, electroneutral sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP from <i>Pyrococcus abyssi</i> at 3.2 \u00c5, and have determined its structure in two different conformations at pH 8 and pH 4. The ion is coordinated by three acidic sidechains, a water molecule, a serine and a main-chain carbonyl in the unwound stretch of trans-membrane helix 5 at the deepest point of a negatively charged cytoplasmic funnel. A second narrow polar channel may facilitate proton uptake from the cytoplasm. Transport activity of PaNhaP is cooperative at pH 6 but not at pH 5. Cooperativity is due to pH-dependent allosteric coupling of protomers through two histidines at the dimer interface. Combined with comprehensive transport studies, the structures of PaNhaP offer unique new insights into the transport mechanism of sodium/proton antiporters."

Detailed structures of antiporters with bound substrate ions are essential for understanding how they work. We have resolved the substrate ion in the dimeric, electroneutral sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP from <i>Pyrococcus abyssi</i> at 3.2 \u00c5, and have determined its structure in two different conformations at pH 8 and pH 4. The ion is coordinated by three acidic sidechains, a water molecule, a serine and a main-chain carbonyl in the unwound stretch of trans-membrane helix 5 at the deepest point of a negatively charged cytoplasmic funnel. A second narrow polar channel may facilitate proton uptake from the cytoplasm. Transport activity of PaNhaP is cooperative at pH 6 but not at pH 5. Cooperativity is due to pH-dependent allosteric coupling of protomers through two histidines at the dimer interface. Combined with comprehensive transport studies, the structures of PaNhaP offer unique new insights into the transport mechanism of sodium/proton antiporters."

The structures the protein takes on in different functional states were then deduced from these crystals using a technique called X-ray crystallography. Using heavy thallium ions instead of sodium ions, which are less visible to X-rays, W\u00f6hlert et al. found the site in the antiporter where the transported ion binds as it moves through the membrane."

PaNhaP is a functional homologue of the human Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE1, which controls intracellular pH and Na<sup>+</sup> concentration. NHE1 is an important drug target (<a href=\"#bib26\">Karmazyn et al., 1999</a>), but its structure and detailed mode of action are unknown. Transport mechanisms of eukaryotic membrane proteins are conserved in the more robust prokaryotic transporters from thermophilic bacteria and archaea (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yamashita et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Boudker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2013</a>). High-resolution structures of such homologues are of great value for understanding the mechanisms of cation/proton antiport, provided that (i) the transported substrate ions are resolved, (ii) structures of the same transporter are available in different conformations, and (iii) kinetic data of substrate binding and transport are available. In this paper we report the structure of the electroneutral Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter PaNhaP from the hyperthermophilic archaeon <i>P. abyssi</i> in two different conformations at pH 4 and pH 8, with the substrate ion resolved at pH 8. We show that, like NHE1, transport by PaNhaP is cooperative in a pH-dependent manner, indicating a pH-dependent allosteric interaction of protomers in the dimer."

The 6 \u00c5 map of EcNhaA resolved 12 trans-membrane helices (TMH) in the protomer, arranged in a 6-helix bundle, plus a row of six TMHs at the dimer interface (<a href=\"#bib47\">Williams, 2000</a>).

By contrast, EcNhaA and TtNapA from <i>Thermus thermophilus</i>, as well as the eukaryotic NHA1-2 and AtChx1 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brett et al., 2005</a>), belong to the CPA2 subfamily of electrogenic antiporters, which exchange one Na<sup>+</sup> against two protons.

Twelve out of the 14 SeMet positions in the asymmetric unit containing one PaNhaP dimer were identified (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Seen from the cytoplasm, the PaNhaP dimer is roughly rectangular, with a long axis of 90 \u00c5 and a short axis of 53 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Each protomer has 13 TMHs (H1-H13) connected by short loops or helices on the membrane surface. H4-6 and H11-13 form the 6-helix bundle, while H1-3 and H7-10 form the dimer interface. H1-6 and H8-13 are two halves of an inverted 6-helix repeat, connected by H7. Several helices are highly tilted, especially H7 and H8, which include angles of more than 45\u00b0 with the membrane normal while others, in particular H6 and H10, are bent. H5 and H12 in the 6-helix bundle are discontinuous. Their cytoplasmic and extracellular halves (referred to as H5<sub>C</sub>, H5<sub>E</sub> and H12<sub>C</sub>, H12<sub>E</sub> respectively) are each connected by unwound stretches with antiparallel orientation, which cross one another in the centre of the protomer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The membrane surfaces are marked by three short amphipathic helices connecting H3 to H4 on the cytoplasmic side, H6 to H7 and H10 to H11 on the extracellular side. H10 protrudes by 11 \u00c5 on the cytoplasmic surface, and the helix hairpin connecting H12 to H13 protrudes by about 7 \u00c5 on the extracellular side.

Electron density in this cavity indicated bound lipid (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), which was identified by thin-layer chromatography as phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), carried over from the <i>E. coli</i> expression host. The lipid stretches from the 6-helix bundle of one protomer to the interface helices H3 and H10 of the other, providing a hydrophobic link between them. The cavity is large enough to accommodate two lipids, only one of which was resolved in the dimer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The surface potential of the dimer indicates clusters of charged residues on both sides of the membrane (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The cytoplasmic ends of H10 and H7 are positively charged, carrying a total of seven lysine and arginine residues.

The ion-binding site is accessible from the cytoplasm but not from the extracellular side, so that the structure shows the inward-open conformation of PaNhaP (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Like Na<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup>, but unlike K<sup>+</sup>, Tl<sup>+</sup> is a substrate of PaNhaP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The thallium ions and their surroundings provide a unique view of the ion-binding site and substrate ion coordination in sodium-proton antiporters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Three acidic side chains in three different TMHs contribute to substrate ion-binding. The carboxyl groups of Glu73 in H3 and Asp159 in H6 coordinate the substrate ion directly. Asp130 in the unwound stretch of H5 interacts with the ion via a bound water molecule (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The main-chain carbonyl of Thr129, likewise in the unwound stretch of H5, and the hydroxyl side chain of Ser155 in H6 provide two additional ligands, bringing the total up to five. The ion coordination geometry is that of a distorted trigonal bipyramid, with Asp159, Ser155 and the water molecule forming a triangle around the central substrate ion, and the Thr129 main chain carbonyl and Glu73 at the tips of the bipyramid (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>)."

As at pH 8, the ion-binding site is accessible from the cytoplasm via the cytoplasmic funnel, but not from the extracellular side. Both structures therefore show an inward-open state. In contrast to the pH 8 structure, the second narrow polar channel is blocked at pH 4 by rearrangements of the surrounding residues Ile151, Phe355, Gly359. The most conspicuous differences to the pH 8 structure are observed near the dimer interface. At pH 8, the His292 sidechains in H10 of the two protomers form a 15 \u00c5 chain of hydrogen bonds with the Glu233 residues near the cytoplasmic ends of H8 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At pH 4, each of the two histidines moves by 6\u20138 \u00c5, apparently due to electrostatic repulsion upon protonation at acidic pH (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This pH-induced conformational change disrupts the chain of hydrogen bonds linking the two protomers (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Other major pH-induced changes are found in the ion bridges linking the protomers across the dimer interface (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At pH 8, Arg25/Glu228 and Arg26/Asp231 connect the cytoplasmic ends of H8 and H1, while the Glu8/Arg249 bridge links the extracellular ends of these helices. At pH 4, all six ion pairs break, apparently due to partial protonation of the acidic sidechains, so that each protomer tilts away from the dimer interface (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Replacement of both ion-coordinating aspartates (Asp130 and Asp159) by serine abolished transport completely (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), whereas mutation of Glu73 to alanine increased the activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), most likely because the substrate ion is released more readily from the binding site. Changing Ser155 to alanine had no significant effect, but mutation of Thr129 to valine that takes this position in eukaryotic CPA1 transporters (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goswami et al., 2011</a>), reduced the activity significantly. This was surprising, because Thr129 coordinates the substrate ion not by its sidechain but by its main-chain carbonyl. However the Thr129 sidechain is a potential interaction partner of the conserved Asn158 that may control access to the ion-binding site through the narrow polar channel.

Although the ion radius of monovalent Tl<sup>+</sup> (1.5 \u00c5) is similar to that of K<sup>+</sup> (1.44 \u00c5) and larger than that of Na<sup>+</sup> (1.12 \u00c5) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shannon, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cotton and Wilkinson, 1988</a>), Tl<sup>+</sup> is able to replace Na<sup>+</sup> in PaNhaP. The same has been found for the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent aspartate transporter Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boudker et al., 2007</a>), the mammalian glutamate transporter EAAC1 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tao et al., 2008</a>) and fructose-1,6-biphosphatase (<a href=\"#bib45\">Villeret et al., 1995</a>). In Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, Na<sup>+</sup> but not K<sup>+</sup> competes for Tl<sup>+</sup> binding, and Tl<sup>+</sup> inhibits Na<sup>+</sup>-driven aspartate transport (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boudker et al., 2007</a>). Coordination geometry and ligand distances for Tl<sup>+</sup> in PaNhaP are similar to those typically found for protein-bound Na<sup>+</sup> in the PDB (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harding, 2002</a>). The larger ion radius of Tl<sup>+</sup> may account for the lower transport rate in PaNhaP. However, Tl<sup>+</sup> is a much better substrate than K<sup>+</sup>, which is not transported at all (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The selectivity for Na<sup>+</sup> over K<sup>+</sup> is reminiscent of the striking selectivity of sodium channels, which is thought to be related to ion solvation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Roux et al., 2011</a>). Presumably, the same principle applies to the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters. The water molecule between the sidechain of Asp130 and Tl<sup>+</sup> indicates that the bound substrate ion retains part of its hydration shell, as complete dehydration is energetically unfavourable."

The resulting bell-shaped pH profile is explained in terms of the Na<sup>+</sup> affinity of the acidic residues in the substrate-binding pocket. The protonation state of these is likely to affect the affinity of the binding site for Na<sup>+</sup>. At low pH, most if not all of the ion-coordinating carboxyl sidechains (Glu73, Asp130, and Asp159) would be protonated, resulting in reduced affinity for Na<sup>+</sup>, as has been shown for MjNhaP1 by electrophysiological measurements on solid-supported membranes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calinescu et al., 2014</a>). At pH 5\u20137 these carboxyl sidechains would be increasingly deprotonated and able to bind and release Na<sup>+</sup> ions, as is necessary for transport. At pH &gt; 7, the ion-binding site is predominantly deprotonated and negatively charged (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), resulting in an increased Na<sup>+</sup> affinity. As a result, the transport rate would decrease, as the ions are bound more tightly. This is consistent with the increased transport rate of the E73A mutant, which has one less carboxyl in the binding site, hence releases Na<sup>+</sup> more easily (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). In addition, the propagation of the pH-induced conformational changes at the dimer interface via Glu73 or Tyr31 would modulate the binding site by changing the coordination geometry for the ions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Future structure-based molecular dynamics simulations should show how the protonation state of each of these residues influence the affinity of the binding site for Na<sup>+</sup> in a pH-dependent manner."

At the pH 5 activity maximum of PaNhaP, transport is not limited by Na<sup>+</sup> affinity. Under these conditions, substrate binding of the PaNhaP dimer is non-cooperative, but unexpectedly it becomes cooperative at pH 6. Cooperative ion binding is most likely mediated by Glu73 and may be important for controlling the intracellular pH at neutral or basic pH, where a cooperative increase in Na<sup>+</sup> affinity would gradually inhibit substrate release and slow down transport. This may be a safety mechanism to protect the organism against excessive influx of Na<sup>+</sup>, and hence efflux of protons, at rising pH, which may be critical for survival."

The PaNhaP structure thus serves as an excellent model for the membrane part of NHE1.

Protons, probably in the form of hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>), can reach the binding pocket either through the cytoplasmic funnel or through the narrow polar channel (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Only small rearrangements of the residues lining this channel would be required for H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> to pass. Using the second narrow polar channel for proton translocation would physically separate the routes for Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> on the cytoplasmic side, which may be an advantage as the two ion currents flow in opposite directions. It would also explain why residues that line this channel, in particular the Glu154/Arg337 ion bridge and Asn158, which do not participate in ion coordination, are so highly conserved in the family. Molecular dynamics simulations and functional analysis of suitable mutants will be required to differentiate between the two proton paths, which both appear equally likely on the basis of the x-ray structures."

The supernatant was supplemented with 5 mM imidazole, incubated for 2 hr with Talon resin (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) at 4\u00b0C and loaded on a Biorad column. Unspecifically bound proteins were eluted with washing buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole and 0.15 % Cymal-5). PaNhaP was cleaved off the column by incubating the beads in elution buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 0.15 % Cymal-5, 20 \u00b5M inositol-hexaphosphate) for 30 min. The eluted protein was concentrated to 5 mg/ml using a concentrator with 50 kDa cutoff and applied to a Superdex 200 size exclusion column equilibrated with 10 mM Na-Citrate pH 4.0, 300 mM NaCl and 0.15 % Cymal-5. Antiporter-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 5 mg/ml. The concentrated protein solution was diluted 1:4 with the same buffer containing 100 mM NaCl and re-concentrated as above. Selenomethionine (SeMet) labeled protein was expressed in PASM-5052 autoinduction medium (<a href=\"#bib43\">Studier, 2005</a>) and purified as described for the native protein in the presence of 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol throughout all purification steps. \u03b2-mercaptoethanol was exchanged to 1 mM TCEP (Tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine) in the final size-exclusion chromatography step."

Finally, the remaining proton gradient was dissipated by adding 25 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in all experiments as a control. Electrogenic transport was investigated by addition of 100 nM valinomycin to the reaction buffer. The temperature was kept constant in a water bath during each experiment.

Together, these structures represent a significant step forward in our understanding of this exchanger family, especially by visualizing a candidate cation binding site (and it's nice that Tl actually can drive transport, suggesting that this is indeed <i>the</i> cation binding site). Mutations of residues involved in cation binding have dramatic effects on transport activity consistent with the proposed role of the identified site. The crystal structures are very nice and the activity assays seem to have been carefully performed. The work is clearly presented and well written. The following comments should be addressed to improve the paper:"

The authors report that the low pH form of the crystal primarily shows changes at the dimer interface but the actual structural rearrangements seem quite small. More of a concern though is how to interpret these changes in the context of mechanism. The state of the transporter in the low pH crystal is not at all clear-is it still inward facing? Lacking information about the state, we find it hard to conclude that the changes at the dimer interface \u2018relay allosteric changes from the other protomer\u2019. Indeed, the authors' interpretation of the structure implies that the low pH form of the protein should have substantially different Na affinity than the pH 8 form (if indeed they reflect the same overall state), but this prediction is not tested with the experiments shown here. Indeed, the Km for Na of 505 uM at pH 5 seems to shift to \u223c200 mM at pH 6 but the structures are at pH 4 and 8, where activity is substantially different. The structures suggest that actual binding affinities could indeed be measured at pH 4 and 8, which would be essential to support the authors' interpretation.

This extends the range for high-affinity substrate binding by \u223c1 pH unit from acidic towards neutral conditions, as may be necessary for efficient Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange at physiological pH in this particular organism. The pH-dependent binding affinity will be the subject of a future molecular dynamics study that goes well beyond the scope of the present manuscript."
