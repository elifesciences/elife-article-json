                    "text": "In mammals, hepatic lipid catabolism is essential for the newborns to efficiently use milk fat as an energy source. However, it is unclear how this critical trait is acquired and regulated. We demonstrate that under the control of PPAR\u03b1, the genes required for lipid catabolism are transcribed before birth so that the neonatal liver has a prompt capacity to extract energy from milk upon suckling. The mechanism involves a fetal glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-PPAR\u03b1 axis in which GR directly regulates the transcriptional activation of PPAR\u03b1 by binding to its promoter. Certain PPAR\u03b1 target genes such as <i>Fgf21</i> remain repressed in the fetal liver and become PPAR\u03b1 responsive after birth following an epigenetic switch triggered by \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate-mediated inhibition of HDAC3. This study identifies an endocrine developmental axis in which fetal GR primes the activity of PPAR\u03b1 in anticipation of the sudden shifts in postnatal nutrient source and metabolic demands."

                    "text": "In mammals, hepatic lipid catabolism is essential for the newborns to efficiently use milk fat as an energy source. However, it is unclear how this critical trait is acquired and regulated. We demonstrate that under the control of PPAR\u03b1, the genes required for lipid catabolism are transcribed before birth so that the neonatal liver has a prompt capacity to extract energy from milk upon suckling. The mechanism involves a fetal glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-PPAR\u03b1 axis in which GR directly regulates the transcriptional activation of PPAR\u03b1 by binding to its promoter. Certain PPAR\u03b1 target genes such as <i>Fgf21</i> remain repressed in the fetal liver and become PPAR\u03b1 responsive after birth following an epigenetic switch triggered by \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate-mediated inhibition of HDAC3. This study identifies an endocrine developmental axis in which fetal GR primes the activity of PPAR\u03b1 in anticipation of the sudden shifts in postnatal nutrient source and metabolic demands."

However, once they are born they need to breathe for themselves and gain all their nutrients from suckling milk. The placenta provides a sugar-rich diet, while milk is richer in fat. Failing to cope with this change in diet leads to serious complications and sometimes death. Therefore, a better understanding of how the body adapts to these changes may shed light on pathways that are important for good health in later life."

However, little is known about how this protein affects the development of the liver."

Without PPAR\u03b1, the expression levels of its target genes, including <i>Fgf21,</i> do not increase after birth, which promotes the build up of fats in liver cells, a condition known as liver steatosis."

Metabolic fluxes change abruptly at birth when milk, which has a higher lipid but relatively lower glucose content, becomes the exclusive nutrient (<a href=\"#bib23\">Girard et al., 1992</a>). At the first few hours after birth, liver expresses the rate-limiting enzymes responsible for extracting energy from milk (<a href=\"#bib36\">Krahling et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Huyghe et al., 2001</a>). However, whether lipid catabolism at birth is developmentally programmed or an adaptive response requiring an external stimulus remains unknown. Failure to adapt to this catabolic switch results in life-threatening errors of metabolism, with serious energy imbalances that are recapitulated in mouse models of neonatal liver steatosis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ibdah et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cherkaoui-Malki et al., 2012</a>)."

However,the role of PPAR\u03b1 in the perinatal liver is not fully understood. Certain PPAR\u03b1 target genes (e.g., acyl-CoA oxidase 1 [<i>Acox1</i>]) are highly expressed in fetal liver at the end of gestation, whereas the expression of others (e.g., fibroblast growth factor 21 [<i>Fgf21</i>]) strictly depends on postnatal milk uptake (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hondares et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yubero et al., 2004</a>). Based on these contrasting observations, we hypothesized the presence of a PPAR\u03b1-triggering program before birth that does not require milk suckling for activation. Given that fetal liver metabolism mostly relies on glycolysis rather than lipid oxidation, we postulated that the liver phenotype of PPAR\u03b1-deficient fetuses may not be obvious due to the absence of a lipid-rich diet challenge."

However, before birth we could barely detect the expression of certain PPAR\u03b1 target genes such as <i>Fgf21</i>, which is exclusively involved in adaptive metabolism. Therefore, we explored the mechanistic basis for the temporal regulation of PPAR\u03b1 target genes. We found that certain PPAR\u03b1 target genes, including <i>Fgf21</i> and <i>Angptl4</i> (Angiopoietin-like 4), are epigenetically controlled by histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and de-repressed in response to \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, a by-product of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Taken together, our data provide the evidence of a major role of glucocorticoid signaling in direct hepatic regulation of PPAR\u03b1 and indirect HDAC3-mediated regulation of FGF21, which controls important metabolic and thermogenic events in the early days of life (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hondares et al., 2010</a>)."

We previously reported that glucocorticoids stimulate PPAR\u03b1 expression in the adult liver, but the mechanism was not elucidated (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lemberger et al., 1994</a>). Interestingly, the mRNA expression of GR (<i>Nr3c1</i>) in the fetal liver is the highest just before birth (<a href=\"#bib53\">Speirs et al., 2004</a>).Because GR plays a role in the preparation for birth (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cole et al., 1995</a>), we further tested GR implication in the regulation of fetal PPAR\u03b1 expression. We confirmed that <i>Nr3c1</i> mRNA levels in the fetal liver peak at embryonic day E19.5, similar to <i>Ppara</i> mRNA expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Notably, <i>Ppara</i> mRNA levels were low in the liver at E13 and E15, but markedly increased at E17, peaking just before birth at E19.5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This observation coincides with a maximal RNA polymerase 2 (Pol2) recruitment to the PPAR\u03b1 transcriptional start site (TSS) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and enhanced nuclear accumulation of PPAR\u03b1 protein similar to the levels in the postnatal pups (Figure 5A). Interestingly, we also observed a significant reduction in the expression of <i>Nr3c1</i> in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> livers during development when compared with <i>Ppara<sup>+/+</sup> </i>controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), suggesting that PPAR\u03b1 may also reciprocally regulate <i>Nr3c1</i> expression. To investigate the regulation of PPAR\u03b1 expression by GR, we treated E15 fetal liver explants, when <i>Ppara</i> expression is relatively low, with GR agonist dexamethasone, which induced <i>Ppara</i> mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We also examined the expression of <i>Ppara</i> in GR-null fetuses at E17 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), when <i>Ppara</i> mRNA levels just begin to increase in the wild-type fetal liver (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). GR exerted a gene dosage effect on the expression of both <i>Ppara</i> and its target genes, including <i>Cpt1a, Hadha, Hadhb</i>, and <i>Cyp4a14</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>)."

We identified three putative GR response elements (GRE) in the promoter/regulatory region of <i>Ppara</i> and analyzed their occupancy by GR in the fetal liver at E17 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an antibody against GR revealed that the element spanning -1007 to -993 was preferentially occupied while the other two sites were not (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Upon treatment of primary hepatocytes with GR-targeting siRNA, the occupancy of GR at this putative site was significantly decreased as compared to treatment with non-targeting siRNA, thereby indicating the specificity of GR binding to this site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Binding of GR to this putative GRE also followed the ontogenic pattern of <i>Ppara</i> expression in the fetal liver (Compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a> with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

Using antibodies against hepatoblast- and hepatocyte-specific markers (i.e., Delta-Like Homolog 1 (DLK) and cytokeratin 18 (CK18), respectively), we performed flow cytometric analyses on the cells extracted from <i>Ppara</i><sup>+/+</sup> and <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> livers at E19.5. Upon cell sorting, we specifically recovered the DLK<sup>+</sup> and CK18<sup>+</sup> fractions. Firstly, we showed that PPAR\u03b1 deficiency only led to marginal changes in these two hepatic cell populations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Secondly, we determined the mRNA expression of <i>Nr3c1, Ppara</i> and the target genes of PPAR\u03b1 in these cells. Our results indicated that both <i>Ppara</i><sup>+/+</sup> hepatoblasts and hepatocytes similarly contributed to the expression of these genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Notably, we observed a modest but not significant upward trend in the expression of oxidative genes (e.g., <i>Acox1, Acaa2, Acadl</i>, and <i>Acadvl</i>) and a downward trend in the expression of glycolytic genes (e.g., <i>Gck</i> and <i>Hk1</i>) in the <i>Ppara</i><sup>+/+</sup> hepatocytes compared to hepatoblasts, possibly suggesting a more pronounced oxidative program in hepatocytes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In contrast, the expression of these genes was concomitantly down-regulated in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> hepatoblasts and hepatocytes, thereby highlighting the pivotal role of PPAR\u03b1 in glycolytic and oxidative metabolism in both cell types."

                                "text": "Consistent with our gene expression studies, <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> fetal livers had reduced numbers of peroxisomes and mitochondria compared to wild-type littermates at E19.5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). However, only the mitochondria numbers but not the peroxisome numbers varied between the two groups at P2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), underscoring the crucial role of mitochondrial FAO in PPAR\u03b1-mediated lipid catabolism after birth. We next measured mitochondrial membrane potential (\u2206<sub>\u03a8m</sub>) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production levels which are two common parameters used in assessing mitochondria health and functions (<a href=\"#bib56\">Suski et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, we observed a much lower \u2206<sub>\u03a8m</sub> and a markedly increased intracellular ROS level in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> primary hepatocytes at P2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), indicative of mitochondria dysfunction at this stage. However, there was no discernible difference in \u2206<sub>\u03a8m</sub> between <i>Ppara</i><sup>+/+</sup> and <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes at E19.5 despite that a slight increase in the intracellular ROS level was observed in the latter. These findings suggest that an increased ROS production in cells likely precedes the loss of \u2206<sub>\u03a8m</sub> and mitochondria dysfunction, consistent with a previous report of a similar mitochondrial disorder associated with the dysfunctions of the respiratory chain components (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lebiedzinska et al., 2010</a>). Indeed, respiratory chain-mediated ATP production in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes was approximately 35\u201350% of the levels measured in both prenatal and postnatal wild-type livers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Substantiating these findings, a reduction of ~2.3-fold was observed in the basal oxygen consumption rate in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> primary hepatocytes from both E19 and P2 livers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). In the presence of FA (i.e., palmitate), the oxygen consumption rate significantly increased in <i>Ppara</i><sup>+/+</sup> hepatocytes but remained very similar in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes, indicating a deficiency in the activation of FAO in the latter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). The addition of etomoxir, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, resulted in significant inhibition of mitochondrial \u03b2-FAO in <i>Ppara</i><sup>+/+</sup> but not in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes. <i>Ppara</i><sup>+/+</sup> hepatocytes exhibited a robust mitochondrial respiratory capacity of ~40% at both time points (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In contrast, only ~25% and ~11% of the total oxygen consumption rate were attributed to mitochondrial \u03b2-FAO in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes from E19 and P2 livers, respectively. Thus, these results provide evidence that PPAR\u03b1-dependent respiration occurs in the term fetus. The higher expression of FA catabolic genes in fetal liver just before birth may prime the liver for the upcoming postnatal energy demand or point to an unknown role of fetal FAO. Therefore, we investigated whether the above defects in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes contribute to any phenotype in the fetal and neonatal liver."

To test whether the change in food composition that occurs at weaning is responsible for the reduction in the fatty liver phenotype as observed in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i>pups after P5-6, we performed a 10-day high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet challenge starting just before P5 and continuing into the suckling-to-weaning transition period. After the high-fat diet (HFD) challenge, the occurrence of liver steatosis was reenacted at P15 in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice which consistently exhibited significantly higher liver weight, hepatic and serum triglyceride levels (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>). In contrast, liver steatosis was absent in the <i>Ppara<sup>+/+</sup></i> counterparts fed the same diet as well as in mice fed the control diet (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013 H</a>). Furthermore, we also demonstrated in hepatocyte-specific <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (i.e., <i>Ppara<sup>fl/fl</sup>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup></i>) the presence of liver steatosis at P3, thereby confirming that the phenotypes observed in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice is most likely due to the hepatocyte-specific\u00a0effects (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014 figure supplement 1I</a>) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Montagner et al., 2016</a>). Taken together, PPAR\u03b1 deficiency leads to lower mitochondria numbers, defective FA oxidative metabolism, and aberrant mitochondria functions which collectively contribute to the development of liver steatosis and hypoketonemia in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> neonates as a result of their inability to metabolize milk lipids."

                                "text": "An effective hepatic FAO is necessary to support hepatic de novo ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis by providing essential co-factors such as acetyl-CoA and/or NADH (<a href=\"#bib24\">Girard, 1986</a>). This notion is consistent with the presence of hypoketonemia in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> neonates with defective hepatic FAO. Interestingly, we found that <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> pups were able to maintain a body weight increase similar to their <i>Ppara<sup>+/+</sup></i> littermates (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), suggesting that <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> neonates harnessed energy required for normal growth from fuels other than ketone bodies and lipids. Furthermore, we did not detect any differences in the plasma glucose levels between the two genotypes during the suckling period from P2 to P15 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). This was rather surprising since <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> neonates were previously reported to exhibit hypoglycemia at P1 due to impaired gluconeogenesis from glycerol (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cotter et al., 2014</a>). This finding prompted us to check whether the gluconeogenesis pathway is modified in the <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> liver at P2. Based on our microarray data, we found that most of the genes (e.g., <i>Gpt, Pck1</i>, and <i>G6pc</i>) encoding the rate-liming enzymes involved in this pathway were up-regulated in parallel with a down-regulation of the rate-limiting genes involved in glycolysis (e.g., <i>Gck, Hk1</i>, and <i>Gpd2</i>) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). We also detected in the <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> liver a significantly elevated level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which is encoded by <i>Gpt</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). ALT is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of amino groups to form the hepatic metabolite oxaloacetate, an intermediate substrate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)/Krebs cycle, which can be used for gluconeogenesis. Thus, we postulated that an increased anaplerotic oxidation of amino acids may be an alternative pathway engaged to maintain gluconeogenesis and to supply glucose as an energy source for normal growth in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> neonates when the FAO capacity was impeded in the absence of PPAR\u03b1. Indeed, most of the rate-limiting enzymes involved in amino acid oxidation (except for valine, leucine, and isoleucine) were concomitantly up-regulated in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> liver at P2 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). Up-regulation of these genes would\u00a0provide some of the intermediate substrates of the TCA cycle, such as \u03b1-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and oxaloacetate, which could be used for gluconeogenesis (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). Importantly, selective inhibition of ALT by intraperitoneal injection of L-cycloserine led to decoupling of amino acid oxidation from gluconeogenesis and ultimately resulted in stunted postnatal growth and hypoglycemia in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> pups (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2F,G</a>). In short, we conclude that PPAR\u03b1 functions both as a prenatally anticipatory and postnatally adaptive regulator of lipid catabolism, ultimately protecting the postnatal liver against a rapid insurgence of steatosis by promoting the use of milk lipids as an energy source."

For instance, the genes (e.g., <i>Acox1</i>) involved in the anticipatory functions of PPAR\u03b1 (i.e., FAO) are stimulated in the fetus, but the adaptive regulators of lipid catabolism, such as the liver-secreted FGF21, were markedly stimulated by PPAR\u03b1 only after birth (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C</a>,<a href=\"#fig5\">5A</a>). The binding of PPAR\u03b1 to the peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) in the promoter of <i>Acox1</i> and <i>Cyp4a14</i> (both genes are indicators for PPAR\u03b1 activation) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tugwood et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 2002</a>), as well as Pol2 recruitment to their respective TSS, occurs before birth and results in increased expression of these genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). This stimulation correlates with higher <i>Ppara</i> TSS activity and mRNA levels during hepatic ontogenesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>).

At E19.5, we found increased active histone marks (i.e., AcH4 and H3K4me3) near the TSS of <i>Acox1</i> and <i>Cyp4a14</i>, which correlated with a reduced enrichment of repressive histone marks (i.e., H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). At P2, the enrichment of active histone marks at the TSS of <i>Acox1</i> and <i>Cyp4a14</i> decreased with a concomitant increase in repressive histone marks, but this was not observed for <i>Fgf21</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>).

In contrast, we detected negligible levels of HDAC3 recruitment to the <i>Cyp4a14</i> TSS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>).

However, trichostatin A alone, regardless of PPAR\u03b1 activation, led to significantly higher expression of <i>Fgf21</i>, suggesting the involvement of a PPAR\u03b1-independent pathway and other class I or class II HDACs in the regulation of <i>Fgf21</i> expression in addition to PPAR\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In contrast, the activity of AcH4 at the TSS of <i>Cyp4a14</i> and <i>Acox1</i> and the expression of these genes were not influenced by any of the treatments except the PPAR\u03b1 ligand WY-14643, thereby excluding the involvement of HDAC3 or other class I and class II HDACs in the regulation of their transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). These results suggest that milk lipids can affect the epigenetic status of the postnatal liver in which hepatic production of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate acts as an inhibitor of HDAC3 that regulates <i>Fgf21</i>."

In the neonatal liver, however, we show that mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation prevails as the major contributor to the neonatal oxidative capacity and protects against hepatic steatosis when faced with a sudden surge in dietary fat. Our findings are consistent with the notion that mitochondrial FAO represents the dominant metabolic pathway whereas peroxisomal FAO assumes a relatively minor role (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hashimoto et al., 1999</a>). Accordingly, long-chain FAs constitute more than 60% of the total FAs in animals and milk (<a href=\"#bib52\">Smith et al., 1968</a>), and their abundance makes them the only significant source of metabolic fuel for the mitochondrial, but not peroxisomal, \u03b2-oxidation system (<a href=\"#bib46\">Reddy and Mannaerts, 1994</a>). Moreover, decreased mitochondrial FAO has been considered one of the major contributing factors leading to liver steatosis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ockner et al., 1993</a>). Thus, we conclude that the concomitant presence of lipid content of milk, a lower number of mitochondria and overt mitochondrial dysfunctions jointly contributes to the development of liver steatosis in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i>neonates. Notably, mitochondrial dysfunctions were evident in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> hepatocytes due to reduced \u2206<sub>\u03a8M</sub> and increased intracellular ROS levels. We postulate that an increased intracellular ROS level likely precedes the loss of \u2206<sub>\u03a8M</sub> and mitochondria dysfunction. As this oxidative stress condition continues to worsen after birth, perhaps induced by nutritional lipid as previously indicated (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tirosh et al., 2009</a>), reduced \u2206<sub>\u03a8M</sub> and ATP production ultimately ensue. This is in agreement with a previous report of a similar mitochondrial disorder associated with the dysfunctional respiratory chain components (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lebiedzinska et al., 2010</a>). Particularly, the increased intracellular ROS levels observed in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes may be due to the reduced clearance of ROS as evidenced by the down-regulation of genes coding for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and copper chaperone for SOD1 (a metalloprotein responsible for delivering copper as a co-factor to SOD1) before and/or after birth (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). This observation is consistent with the report that PPAR\u03b1 activation by agonist clofibrate stimulates SOD1 and catalase activities as part of the defense mechanisms against oxidative stress in the heart (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ibarra-Lara et al., 2016</a>)."

                        "text": "Many of the PPAR\u03b1-regulated genes involved in FAO have previously been shown to contain a PPRE in their promoter region and hence, recognized as direct PPAR\u03b1 target genes (Rakhshandehroo et al., 2010). This implicates that the reduced oxidative capacity observed in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice was due to the lack of direct PPAR\u03b1-mediated stimulatory effects rather than a cellular-autonomous metabolic adaptation in response to lower mitochondria numbers. As discovered by Semenkovich and<a href=\"#bib45\">Rakhshandehroo et al., 2010</a> co-workers (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chakravarthy et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2009</a>), newly synthesized FA by fatty acid synthase may also regulate glucose, lipid, and cholesterol metabolism by serving as endogenous activators of a distinct physiological pool of PPAR\u03b1 ligands in adult liver. However, we doubt that de novo synthesis of FA plays a predominant role in the regulation of PPAR\u03b1 activity during early postnatal period since insulin/glucagon ratio is low, which promotes FAO rather than de novo synthesis of FA (<a href=\"#bib22\">Girard et al., 1977</a>). Our recent work indicates that PPAR\u03b1 has little impact on the expression of lipogenic genes in normal conditions (<a href=\"#bib40\">Montagner et al., 2016</a>). Moreover, an effective hepatic FAO is essential for the provision of acetyl-CoA and NADH to support hepatic de novo ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Girard, 1986</a>). This notion is consistent with the hypoketonemia and hypoglycemia in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i>neonates reported in this work and by Crawford and co-workers (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cotter et al., 2014</a>). Notably, the hypoglycemic phenotype previously reported in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i>neonates by Cotter et al. happened at P1 due to a decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis from glycerol. However, we did not detect any sign of hypoglycemia in these mice starting from P2. This apparent discrepancy is likely attributable to the rapid (~1 day) and dynamic adaptive functions of <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> </i>neonatal liver in providing glucose as the primary source of energy required for postnatal growth and in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Our finding also supports the work of others indicating a preserved gluconeogenesis from glycerol in adult <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib63\">Xu et al., 2002</a>). We elucidated that this cell-autonomous metabolic adaptation was enhanced in the absence of PPAR\u03b1 and mediated through the up-regulation of hepatic ALT and anaplerotic amino acid oxidation. Thus far, the mechanism behind the increased production and secretion of ALT in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> </i>neonatal liver still remains unclear. It is notable that <i>ALT2</i> expression is up-regulated under metabolic stress and that plasma and tissue ALT levels are elevated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<a href=\"#bib48\">Salgado et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Josekutty et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, defective PPAR\u03b1 signaling has been reported to cause hepatic mitochondrial and ER stress in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis through reduced mRNA expression of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Su et al., 2014</a>). In addition, our transcriptome analysis revealed a consistent reduction by ~1.2-fold in the expression of <i>Atp2a2</i>, which encodes SERCA, in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> liver at E19.5 and P2 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Moreover, we also delineated that most of the rate-limiting enzymes involved in amino acid oxidation were concomitantly up-regulated in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> </i>neonatal liver to provide essential intermediate substrates in TCA/Krebs cycle required for gluconeogenesis. Hence, we speculate that de novo synthesis of glucose becomes the primary energy source in sustaining normal postnatal growth in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> </i>neonates as evidenced by the observed growth retardation upon decoupling of amino acid oxidation from gluconeogenesis. This is in conjunction with the failure of <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> </i>neonatal liver in harnessing energy from ketone bodies and lipids due to defective mitochondrial functions. In parallel, the compensatory up-regulation of pyruvate carboxylase (Pcx) and other gluconeogenic genes in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i>neonates at P2 probably corresponds with a lower hepatic acetyl-CoA level, as supported by a recent report that hepatic acetyl-CoA acts as an allosteric regulator of Pcx (<a href=\"#bib44\">Perry et al., 2015</a>). Importantly, these findings in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i>mice illustrate the tremendous flexibility of the neonatal liver in coordinating ketogenesis, FAO, and gluconeogenesis so as to meet the energy demand required for normal growth especially when faced with an energy crisis caused by defective oxidative metabolism and hypoketonemia."

HMGCS2 has been shown to induce mitochondrial FAO and FGF21 expression, possibly via a SIRT1-dependent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vil\u00e0-Brau et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, <i>Hmgcs2</i> mRNA expression peaks 16\u2009hr after birth and coincides with a decline in <i>Acox1</i> mRNA expression thereafter (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yubero et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Serra et al., 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">1996</a>). These reports substantiate our findings of preferential activation of mitochondrial FAO at birth. Our results also support the in vivo finding that \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate is a potent physiological inhibitor of HDAC3 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shimazu et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that PPAR\u03b1-mediated activation of HMGCS2 and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate production precedes the PPAR\u03b1-regulated production of FGF21. Similar to other PPAR\u03b1 target genes, we detected PPAR\u03b1 occupancy in the <i>Fgf21</i> promoter before birth, but its transcription is ultimately determined by the alleviation of HDAC3-mediated inhibition (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Thus, fatty acid catabolism provides \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, which acts as a secondary signal to initiate the de-repression of the <i>Fgf21</i> promoter by HDAC3, allowing it to become PPAR\u03b1 responsive. It was previously indicated that HDAC-mediated histone deacetylation may inhibit transcription at the initiation and/or elongation step (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). If the genes are loaded by Pol2 at the TSS, similar to what we observed at the <i>Fgf21</i> TSS upon PPAR\u03b1 agonistic activation, HDAC-mediated inhibition of transcription most likely happens at the elongation step although abortive initiation of the TSS bound Pol2 cannot be excluded. Our results suggest that PPAR\u03b1 activation induces the recruitment and assembly of a transcription initiation complex at the <i>Fgf21</i> TSS. However, the elongation of <i>Fgf21</i> mRNA transcript only ensues after alleviation of HDAC3 inhibition by \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate. Therefore, it is consistent with our findings that PPAR\u03b1 agonist has no effect on <i>Fgf21</i> mRNA or transcriptional activation in the absence of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate."

We believe that it could be due to the use of lipids as preferred fuel for growth while the carbohydrate parts of milk (e.g., lactose and oligosaccharide\u2212two main carbohydrates in milk) mainly contribute to brain growth (i.e., myelin synthesis) and gut microbiota nourishment (<a href=\"#bib18\">Edmond, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chichlowski et al., 2011</a>). Further, the observed ketogenic condition may also be explained by the low insulin/glucagon ratio in early postpartum life (<a href=\"#bib22\">Girard et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ferr\u00e9 et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Girard et al., 1992</a>). We found that ketone bodies act as a hit that is important to prime PPAR\u03b1-dependent expressions of <i>Fgf21</i> and <i>Angptl4</i> by modulating HDAC3 activity on their promoter. Both FGF21 and ANGPTL4 function as secreted systemic effectors of PPAR\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Badman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dijk and Kersten, 2014</a>). However, unlike <i>Fgf21</i>, the expression of <i>Angptl4</i> has already begun in the fetal liver. This finding is congruent with the report that ANGPTL4 functions as a glucocorticoid-dependent gatekeeper of FA flux by inhibiting the activity of adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase during fasting (<a href=\"#bib35\">Koliwad et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dijk and Kersten, 2014</a>). In fact, significant overlap exists between the bioenergetic challenges experienced during fasting and at birth. Liver-derived FGF21 acts as an endocrine regulator of ketogenesis, which links the phenotypes observed during fasting and in newborns (<a href=\"#bib4\">Badman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hondares et al., 2010</a>). This concept is evident in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, which have reduced plasma FGF21 levels. During fasting, the switch to a lipid-dominated nutrient supply provokes hypoketonemia, hypoglycemia, and hepatic steatosis in adult <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kersten et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Montagner et al., 2016</a>). In concordance with a recent report (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cotter et al., 2014</a>), the shift to a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet in <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> neonates results in steatosis similar to that observed in fasted adult <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Notably, FGF21 has previously been shown to stimulate hepatic FAO and to prevent hepatic steatosis following ingestion of lipid-laden milk (<a href=\"#bib62\">Xu et al., 2009</a>). Hence, we believe that the physiological relevance of FGF21 induction in neonates after milk suckling relates to its role in metabolic regulation by stimulating lipid catabolism rather than a response to starvation or a low calorie condition which no longer exists upon milk ingestion. It is also important to note that the early human breast milk is not initially ketogenic due to the relatively high lactose content, which gradually decreases while the fat content increases as the milk matures over time (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jenness, 1979</a>). In contrast, mouse milk is likely a ketogenic diet as evidenced by a previous report that early mouse milk comprises ~17% of fat and ~1.7% of lactose at P3 (<a href=\"#bib25\">G\u00f6rs et al., 2004</a>). Therefore, direct translation of our findings to human situations needs to be cautioned for such differences in milk composition."

In addition, hepatic FA catabolism provides essential co-factors for the synthesis of ketone bodies such as \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate.

These mice were given standard rodent chow diet (AIN93M, Specialty Feeds, Australia) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and water ad libitum, maintained in a C57BL/6 background, and bred in our specific pathogen-free facilities by inter-crossing <i>Ppara</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice to obtain experimental wild-type and knockout pups in the same litter. This breeding strategy allowed the experimental mice to be exposed to the same gestational environment and ensured that pups received milk of the same nutritional content from the heterozygous dams. Pregnancy was timed based on vaginal plug formation. Pregnant dams approaching full-term were closely monitored and cesarean section performed to obtain fetuses at E19.5 or earlier (E13, E15, E17). Pups at P2 were timed based on the delivery day. Litters of 6\u20138 pups were used to minimize differences in milk availability verified by stomach inspection. All experimental protocols involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Veterinary Office of the Canton Vaud (SCA\u2013EXPANIM, Service de la Consommation et des Affaires V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, Epalinges, Switzerland) in accordance with the Federal Swiss Veterinary Office Guidelines and by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#2013/SHS/866) in Singapore.

Cell viability assay was performed in extracted primary hepatocytes using trypan blue exclusion test based on a protocol previously described (<a href=\"#bib54\">Strober, 2001</a>). The production of pyruvate via the glycolytic metabolism of glucose yields 2 net ATP, but the same catalytic pathway yields no net ATP when galactose is used instead of glucose, thereby forcing cells to rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy. Thus, the use of galactose in the primary hepatocyte culture acts as a positive control for the measurement of oxidative phosphorylation-dependent energy production (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aguer et al., 2011</a>)."

Beta-tubulin and U2AF65 were used to check for equal loading and the transfer of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, respectively. Primary antibody against full-length ANGPTL4 was a kind gift from Prof. Andrew Tan Nguan Soon. Primary antibodies against ACOX1 (#sc-98499), FGF21(#sc-292879), CYP4A14 (#sc-46087), \u03b2-tubulin (#sc-9104), U2AF65 (#sc-48804), GR (#sc-1004), and HDAC3 (#sc-17795), and all secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX).

We set the mean outcome for <i>Ppara<sup>+/+</sup></i> and <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice at 100 and 80, respectively (i.e., 20% difference) and estimated the standard deviation to be \u00b1 10% based on our preliminary data. We estimated that a total of 6 mice per group is needed in order to have a power of 80%, which means there is an 80% likelihood that the study will yield a statistically significant (i.e., \u03b1 value = 0.05) effect to allow us to detect a mean outcome difference of 20% between <i>Ppara<sup>+/</sup></i><sup>+</sup> and <i>Ppara</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. The outcomes (e.g., gene expression, metabolic parameters) are measured on a continuous scale. The null hypothesis is that the mean outcome for these two groups is identical. The computation of the sample size is based on the assumption that there would be no missing data (i.e., all mice will produce data). The data in all figure panels reflect multiple experiments performed on different days using pups (n = 6 with triplicates) derived from different litters. In this study, we used 6 mice per group (i.e., biological replicates) for all experiments. Further, measurements and experiments were repeated in triplicates for each sample (i.e., technical replication). Values were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical tests, including the two-tailed Mann-Whitney and two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis, were performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 5.00). p<i>-</i>values&lt;0.05 were considered significant."

The story is very interesting as general knowledge and it adds a novel model by which the liver may adapt to changes in the diet and how this adaptation could be exploited in health and disease. Specifically, the paper explores the mechanism underlying the activation of the transcription factor PPAR\u03b1 in liver during the late embryonic period and the impact of this mechanism on cellular energetics and lipid metabolism. The paper highlights the crucial role of the glucocorticoid receptor in activation of PPAR\u03b1 during embryogenesis, and proposes a contribution of epigenetic mechanisms involving the ketone body \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate. The paper consists of a number of mini-stories that differ substantially in the quality of the data and in the level of depth provided. Some of the mini-stories are mostly confirmatory, while others are novel. The unification of the individual stories into a coherent and convincing overall message is a bit problematic and deserves attention. Even though the experiments are very well conducted, there are some pitfalls that should be resolved for a better understanding of the main points of the story."

The demonstration that the glucocorticoid receptor is the driving force behind induction of PPAR\u03b1 during embryogenesis and directly binds to the PPAR\u03b1 promoter is very interesting and novel. The data showing a major impact of PPAR\u03b1 deletion on neonatal lipid metabolism are confirmatory of a publication by Cotter et al. (Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 2014 Jul 15; 307(2): E176-E187). The data on epigenetic regulation of PPAR\u03b1 target genes are interesting but do not link particularly well to the data on lipid metabolism. \u0392-hydroxybutyrate may contribute to induction of specific PPAR\u03b1 target genes (<i>Fgf21</i>) via epigenetic mechanism but how does this effect connect to the observed phenotype of <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. The part describing epigenetic regulation by \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate is potentially very exciting (following the work of Verdin) but the physiological/metabolic rationale needs to be better explained."

Since the deletion of <i>Ppar\u03b1</i> is constitutive, it would be important to show if either the changes seen at E19.5 are stemming from the pluripotent hepatoblasts compartment or from the hepatocytes. The same is observed in the newly born population. This is a key point to be addressed since it could change the main story.

In parallel, we also observed an augmented expression of pyruvate carboxylase (<i>Pcx)</i> and other gluconeogenic genes in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> liver (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). This compensatory effect likely corresponds with a lower hepatic acetyl-CoA level, as supported by a recent report that the hepatic acetyl-CoA acts as an allosteric regulator of Pcx (Perry et al., 2015) (PMID: 25662011). We have discussed this information in the Discussion (fourth paragraph)."

Interestingly, we observed a much lower mitochondrial membrane potential (\u2206\u03a8m) and a markedly increased intracellular ROS level in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> hepatocytes at P2, indicative of mitochondria dysfunction at this stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). However, there was no discernible difference in \u2206\u03a8m between <i>Ppar\u03b1</i><sup>+/+</sup> and <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> hepatocytes at E19.5 despite that a slight increase in the intracellular ROS level was observed in the latter. These findings suggest that an increased ROS level in cells likely precedes the loss of \u2206\u03a8m and mitochondria dysfunction. This is consistent with a previous report of a similar mitochondrial disorder associated with the dysfunctions of the respiratory chain components (Lebiedzinska et al., 2010) (PMID: 20226758). Particularly, the increased intracellular ROS levels observed in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> hepatocytes may be due to the reduced clearance of ROS as evidenced by the down-regulated of genes coding for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and copper chaperone for SOD1 before and/or after birth (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>).

Up-regulation of these genes provides some of the substrates in TCA cycle, such as \u03b1-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and oxaloacetate, which are ultimately used for gluconeogenesis.

In our opinion, it is the deficiency in metabolising the dietary fat that contributes to this steatotic phenotype in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> livers because in the early days of life mouse milk is abundant in lipids and insulin level is low while glucagon is high, which promotes FAO rather than de novo synthesis of FA (Girard et al., 1977) (doi: 10.1007/978-1-4612-6366-1_36). As discovered by Semenkovich and co-workers (Chakravarthy et al., 2005, Chakravarthy et al., 2009) (PMID:16054078, 19646743), new FA synthesized by fatty acid synthase regulates glucose, lipid, and cholesterol metabolism by serving as endogenous activators of distinct physiological pools of PPAR\u03b1 in adult liver. However, we doubt that de novo synthesis of FA plays a predominant role in the regulation of PPAR\u03b1 activity during early postnatal period since insulin/glucagon ratio is low."

As described by Jenness (1979) (PMID: 392766), fat content does not vary much during lactation but exhibits large diurnal variations and increases during the course of each nursing. Therefore, the human breast milk may be classified as not ketogenic. However, both newborn humans and mouse pups are in ketogenic conditions, in which similar plasma concentrations of ketone body were detected in both species (0.2-0.5 mmol/L) (Hamosh, 2004) (doi:10.1016/B978-0-7216-9654-6.50032-1). This neonatal ketogenic condition could be due to a low plasma insulin/glucagon ratio at this stage of life. Furthermore, many scientists are more inclined towards the notion that lactose and oligosaccharides\u2212two of the main carbohydrates present in the milk, are not used as general fuel, but preferentially to support the growth of the brain and myelin synthesis as well as to provide nutrients for the newly established gut microbiota of infants (Edmond, 1992; Chichlowski et al., 2011) (PMID: 1295662, 22129386). Indeed, many believe that the reason for such a ketogenic environment in human infants is crucial to preserve carbohydrates for the development of the brain (Klepper et al., 2002) (PMID: 12555938). Therefore, oxidative metabolism of lipids represents a preferred fuel for the newborns. We have tried to clarify and discussed this important information in the Discussion (sixth paragraph)."

Relating to the previous comment, the purpose of the high-fat diet (HFD) challenge we performed in this experiment was to test whether the change in food composition that occurs at weaning is responsible for the reduction in the fatty liver phenotype as observed in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> pups after P5-6 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Indeed, many other changes occur at weaning, including changes in the insulin/glucagon ratio (Girard et al., 1977). The high-fat diet (HFD) experiment indicates that the lipid content of the milk primarily contributes to the development of liver steatosis in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> pups. Our findings suggest that the concomitant presence of mitochondrial dysfunction (cum defective oxidative capacity) and dietary fat synergistically contribute to the development of liver steatosis in <i>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></i> neonates. As discussed in our response to comment #2, both newborn humans and mouse pups are in ketogenic condition (Medina and Tabernero, 2005) (PMID: 15573408). We believe that the high circulating levels of ketone bodies (e.g., \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate) in neonates are due to the use of lipids as the preferred fuel to support the energy demand for growth. This in turn induces FGF21 through HDAC3 inhibition by ketone bodies. We believe that the induction of FGF21 in neonates after milk suckling relates more to metabolic regulation rather than a response to starvation/low calorie condition which should no longer exist upon milk ingestion. This notion is substantiated by the stimulatory effects of FGF21 on hepatic FAO and energy expenditure to prevent hepatic steatosis following milk ingestion (Xu et al., 2009) (PMID: PMC2606881). We have clarified this point in the Results (subsection \u201cPPAR\u03b1 Is Required for Protection against Neonatal Hepatic Steatosis\u201d, second paragraph).

It is unclear why neonates exhibit higher circulating levels of ketone bodies. We believe that it could be associated with the use of lipids as preferred fuel for growth while the carbohydrate parts of milk contribute to brain growth and gut microbiota nourishment. Further, the ketogenic condition may also be explained by the low insulin/glucagon ratio in early postpartum life. Regardless, it is clear that ketone bodies act as a hit that is important to prime PPAR\u03b1-dependent expression of <i>Fgf21</i> by modulating HDAC3 activity on <i>Fgf21</i> promoter.
