Firstly, in the presence of odors, flies alter their walking in unexpectedly large number of ways. Therefore, one needs to consider many different factors, or \u201cmotor parameters\u201d, to describe how odors affect a fly\u2019s movement. For instance, instead of just walking faster or slower, a fly can change how long it stops (stop duration), how long it runs (run duration) and how fast it runs (run speed) \u2013 all of which will affect overall speed. Secondly, a single class of ORN can strongly affect some parameters (like run duration) without affecting others (like stop duration). These data indicate that the neural circuits involved have a modular organization in which each ORN class affects a subset of motor parameters, and each motor parameter is affected by a subset of ORN classes. These findings were largely unexpected."

But for many organisms, the world is dominated by their sense of smell, in which every day activities like finding food depends on the ability to modulate behavior based on olfactory cues. To meet the challenges of detecting and discriminating between different olfactory cues, animals are endowed with large families of odorant receptors (ORs)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib56\">Spehr and Munger, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Touhara and Vosshall, 2009</a>)\u00a0that are expressed in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and bind to odors. In phylogenetically diverse species, individual ORNs express only one or few ORs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buck and Axel, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Su et al., 2009</a>) which largely determine their response specificity; thus ORNs can be classified into a discrete number of classes\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib61\">Vosshall et al., 1999</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib62\">Vosshall et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Clyne et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Clyne et al., 1999</a>) according to the OR gene\u00a0they express.

Initial work (<a href=\"#bib34\">Karlson and L\u00fcscher, 1959</a>) suggested that there are 'specialist' ORNs that bind to odors of particular ecological importance and play a major role in inter- and intra-species chemical communication. Recent work has shown that only a minority of chemical communication occurs through the detection of rare, highly-specialized chemicals by a single ORN class (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kaissling, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dorries et al., 1995</a>). Most chemical communication involves integration of signals from multiple ORN classes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Christensen and Sorensen, 1996</a>). Activation of different combinations of these ORNs can signal predator (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mullersc, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Endres and Fendt, 2009</a>), encourage approach (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dorries et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dorries et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lin et al., 2005</a>; ) or aggression (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ropartz, 1968</a>), cause aggregation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartelt, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bartelt, 1985</a>) and exert their effect by modulating a wide-range of specific motor programs implying that odors have diverse effect on an animal\u2019s behavior."

According to current models of the function of generalist ORN classes, activity in the generalist ORNs are decoded by higher-order neurons to create an olfactory percept. Olfactory perception is probed by examining either an animal\u2019s ability to discriminate between different odors or the hedonic valence (<a href=\"#bib37\">Knaden and Hansson, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Knaden et al., 2012</a>) it assigns to different odors. These approaches to the study of olfactory perception are rooted in the psychophysical literature where an animal is made to choose between a few discrete behaviors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Green, 1966</a>). A limitation of these approaches is that it has led to a 'portmanteau teleological' (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kennedy, 1978</a>) description of generalist odors as attractants or repellents. As a result, even in a sophisticated analysis of an animal\u2019s navigation to an odor source, the experiments invariably test a single odorant (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albrecht and Bargmann, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Budick, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Johnsen and Teeter, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Weissburg, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baker and Kuenen, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Porter et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gao et al., 2013</a>). The possibility that, like the ORNs involved in chemical communication, the generalist ORNs also signal diverse behavioral goals and exert their effect by modulating specific motor programs has not been explored."

We created a novel behavioral assay in which both the fly\u2019s level of attraction to an odor and the change in locomotion in the presence of that odor could be measured. We investigated how different odors which activate different ORNs modulate locomotion, and how mutating different ORN classes affects a fly\u2019s behavior in response to a natural odor. The null hypothesis was that based on the pattern of ORN activation flies would decide how attractive an odor is and modulate their locomotion according to the level of attraction. Our data is inconsistent with this simple model; and instead supports a different view of odor-guided locomotion that has three salient features. One salient feature is that odors independently modulate a surprising number of locomotor parameters. A second salient feature is that two similarly attractive odors can produce changes in completely different aspects of locomotion. A third salient feature is that a single ORN class can strongly affect some motor parameters (like run duration) without affecting other parameters (like stop duration or angular speed). These data support a modular organization in which each ORN class affects a subset of motor parameters, and each motor parameter is affected by a subset of ORN classes."

A push-pull arrangement whereby air is pushed into the arena via an inlet tube and pulled through the arena by vacuum creates a sharp interface between a central zone of constant odor concentration (i.e. the odor-zone) and a surrounding no-odor zone. To demonstrate that the odor is limited to the odor-zone, we performed smoke visualization, and found that smoke introduced through the inlet tube was confined to the odor-zone, implying that odor from the inlet tube should also be limited to the odor-zone (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To directly assess the spread of odors in the arena, we performed field-potential recordings from flies\u2019 antennae (i.e. electroantennogram or EAG) at different locations in the arena. The EAG responses were uniformly large inside the odor-zone and rapidly decreased with distance outside (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We estimate that the odor concentration decreases to less than 10% of its peak 3 mm away from the boundary of the nominal odor-zone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Thus, in our walking arena an odor-zone is separated from a no-odor-zone by a sharp interface."

Before odor onset, the fly spends most of its time at the outer border with occasional forays to the center of the arena (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The fly encounters the odor only when it enters the odor-zone for the first time after the odor is turned on. In the presence of apple cider vinegar (ACV), a strong attractant, flies spend 2.5-fold more time inside the odor-zone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) than during the control period. The fractional time inside is a measure of attraction. In later experiments, we will use a metric, attraction index (see Materials and methods), based on the change in time spent inside the odor-zone to measure attraction.

In an initial screen for attractive odors, using fractional time spent inside as the metric for quantifying attraction, we found that 2-butanone was strongly attractive to the fly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, statistical test for attraction shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We compared how undiluted ACV (ACV0) and 2-butanone at 10<sup>-3</sup> dilution (BUN3), both of which are strongly attractive to the fly, modulate locomotion. The trajectory of a fly in response to the two odors is noticeably different (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013H</a> , also see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>,<a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). In the presence of ACV0, flies preferentially walk along the interface between the odor-zone and no-odor zone and make sharp turns outside the odor-zone to return to the odor-zone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,G</a>). In contrast, in the presence of BUN3, the flies distribute more uniformly inside the odor-zone and return to the odor-zone largely via smooth turns (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Thus, visual observation of the differences in a fly\u2019s trajectory suggests that its response to BUN3 is not simply a scaled-down version of its response to ACV0. Rather, the differences in the fly\u2019s trajectories in response to the two odors suggest that different odors modulate a fly\u2019s locomotion in qualitatively distinct ways. One difference is the rapid change in speed as the fly enters the odor-zone. Flies decrease their speed when they enter the odor-zone in the presence of ACV0 but not in the presence of BUN3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> ; also see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Conversely, as the flies exit the odor-zone there is an increase in speed in the presence of ACV0 but not in the presence of BUN3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

If this rationale were true, we would expect that at a concentration at which the attractiveness of ACV0 and BUN3 are matched, the motor programs should be matched too. To test this idea, we performed behavioral experiments at 5 concentrations of apple cider vinegar and found that apple cider vinegar at a concentration of 10<sup>-2</sup> (ACV2) had a similar level of attractiveness as BUN3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Yet, the motor parameters modulated by ACV2 and BUN3 are different. Unlike their response to BUN3, flies decreased their speed upon entering the odor-zone in the presence of ACV2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Moreover, the increased rate of sharp turns at the odor border observed with ACV0 was still observed at the lower concentration of ACV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Thus, we concluded that equally attractive odors modulate distinct motor parameters."

Level of attraction, measured by the fraction of time a fly spends inside the odor-zone, depends on two mutually exclusive programs: Level of attraction would increase if visits to the odor-zone last longer. This can be quantified by measuring time inside/transit (see Materials and methods). Level of attraction will also increase if the time between successive visits becomes shorter (time to return, see Materials and methods). If the level of attractiveness defines a fly\u2019s behavior, we would expect that flies that are more attracted to ACV0 should strongly modulate both time inside/transit (t<sub>i</sub>) and time to return (t<sub>r</sub>) and hence how strongly these two parameters are modulated in a given fly should be correlated. Instead, we found virtually no correlation between t<sub>i</sub> and t<sub>r</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), implying that there is considerable flexibility in the motor parameters modulated by a given odor. All together, the differences in motor parameters modulated by ACV2 and BUN3 and the lack of correlation between modulation of time inside/transit and time to return shows that level of attraction is a poor descriptor of the change in behavior in response to a given odor. In the rest of this study, we create a quantitative framework to analyze the behavioral response of the fly. Using this framework, we analyze the role of different ORN classes in mediating the behavioral response to ACV and the overall logic by which olfactory cues modulate locomotion."

In all of these organisms, locomotion can be described in terms of straight runs punctuated by discrete stops during which the organism changes its orientation. Odors exert their effect on locomotion by modulating the duration of runs and by biasing orientation. This simple description fails to describe the behavior of an adult fly because a fly\u2019s locomotion cannot be decomposed into a series of straight runs and stops. For instance, flies can change their orientation by turning smoothly during a run. Our attempts to fit a statistical model such as Hidden Markov Model, which has been employed to describe the behavior of simpler organisms (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gallagher et al., 2013</a>), were unsuccessful (data not shown). Therefore, we employed an ad-hoc approach to parameterize the fly\u2019s odor response\u00a0and investigated how odors affect a large number of locomotor parameters Out of the parameters we investigated, we found 17 parameters (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) that are all significantly (p &lt;0.05 in a rank sum test) modulated by ACV0. These parameters describe how a fly\u2019s position (4 parameters), speed (4 parameters), run and stop statistics (4 parameters) and turns (5 parameters) are modulated (details in Materials and methods). We expected these parameters to be dependent on each other; and measured pairwise correlation to identify dependent parameters (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Surprisingly, we found that the linear correlation between these 17 parameters is small, suggesting that they are largely independent of each other. The number of parameters required to describe a fly\u2019s behavior is large because a fly can modulate its locomotion inside the odor-zone independently from its locomotion outside it and also because the same parameter (like speed) is modulated independently across different time windows."

The parameters which are significantly different at p &lt;0.003 (or 0.05/17 - \u2014corresponding to testing whether a given parameter is different after correcting for multiple comparison) were considered to be significantly modulated by a given odor (marked by a bar in individual panels in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Overlapping but distinct sets of parameters are modulated by ACV0 and BUN3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). A fly\u2019s response to BUN3 is characterized by a decrease in stop duration and a large increase in its propensity to return to the odor-zone along gently curved trajectories (reflected as a change in smooth turns outside) which results in a large drop in t<sub>r</sub>. The attraction of flies to BUN3 is primarily a result of flies returning to the odor-zone more often. Flies decrease their return time even in the presence of ACV0, but they do so primarily by making sharp turns outside the odor-zone \u2013 an activity which leads them back to the odor. Additionally, the flies spend more time inside the odor-zone\u00a0every time they enter inside by decreasing their speed inside the odor-zone and making sharp turns to stay inside it."

PCA is a mathematical algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining most of the variation in a particular data set. In an extreme case where the attractiveness of an odor determines how strongly every other parameter is modulated, we would expect that a single parameter (i.e. attraction index) would capture most of the variability in the behavior. Instead, we found that the first principal component only captured about 25% of the variance in data and the first seven principal components together contribute 90% to the variance in the data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

It is possible that the differences in behavior arise from different temporal evolution of behavior. That is, the initial behavioral response is the same for all odors; but, behavioral response evolves differently for different odors resulting in behavior which is different for different odors. To control for this possibility, we evaluated the differences in behavior for BUN3 and ACV2 pair in the first 20 s after odor was turned on. We found that the differences in behavior between BUN3 and ACV2 are even greater in the first 20 s of exposure to odor (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is possible that the differences we observe between the two odors reflect the fact that ACV is a complex food odor and BUN is a monomolecular odor. To test for this possibility we compared the responses of the fly to ACV and banana. These responses are also distinct (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Similarly, the response to BUN3 is different from the response to another monomolecular odor, ethyl acetate at 10<sup>-4</sup> dilution (ETA4, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

To understand how activities from multiple ORN classes are integrated to drive behavioral response to natural odors, we carried out a series of experiments to dissect the contribution of different ORN classes to the behavioral response of a fly to ACV. We first assessed which ORN classes are activated by ACV. ORNs are housed within three morphological classes of sensilla (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shanbhag and Muller, 1999</a>)\u2013 basiconic, coeloconic and trichoid. Because most of the generalist ORN classes reside in the basiconic and coeloconic sensilla (<a href=\"#bib57\">Su et al., 2009</a>), we measured odor-evoked responses from all basiconic and coeloconic sensilla using single sensillum recording. We matched the stimulus in the behavioral chamber to that on the electrophysiological rig by matching the amplitude of EAG response measured in the behavioral chamber to the EAG response in an electrophysiological rig. In all, we recorded responses from 10 basiconic sensilla which house 24 ORN classes, and 4 coeloconic sensilla which contain 11 ORN classes and from the antennal sacculus which houses Ir64a-ORNs. Out of these 36 ORN classes, we found that ACV0 activates 7 ORN classes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> , see Materials and methods for details). Because we calculate most motor parameters as an average over the entire 3 min period, and because we have not observed any effect of different levels of activity of ORN on behavior, we are only reporting which ORNs are activated by ACV. In the rest of this study, we will use mutants, specific odors and lower concentration of ACV to probe the contribution of different ORN classes activated by ACV to behavior."

A previous study has shown that activating <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs alone produces robust attraction (<a href=\"#bib54\">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</a>). Moreover, we found that of the 7 ORNs activated by ACV, <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs are the most sensitive (see below). Therefore, we started by analyzing the role of <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs in behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We activated the <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs alone by using low concentrations of ethyl acetate (<a href=\"#bib46\">Olsen et al., 2010</a>). We have previously shown that ethyl acetate at a concentration &lt;10<sup>-6</sup> only activates <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs<sup>33,34</sup> and confirmed that the same is true under the exact stimulus conditions used in this study (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In behavioral experiments, we found that ethyl acetate at 10<sup>-8</sup> (ETA8) does not elicit attraction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, first panel). The lack of attraction is not due to the activation of <i>Or85a</i>-ORNs (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) which are important for odor-mediated repulsion (<a href=\"#bib54\">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</a>).

Thus, activation of <i>Or42b-</i>ORNs alone affects only a small subset of motor parameters affected by ACV0, and modulation of these parameters does not lead to attraction.

First, using the same strategy we employed to show that <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs are the only ones activated by low concentrations of ethyl acetate, we established that <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs are the most sensitive to ACV (data not shown). ACV elicits a robust response in <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs even at a 10<sup>-4</sup> dilution (ACV4). EAG response to ACV4 is abolished in the <i>Or42b</i>-mutant implying that the <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs are the only ORNs strongly activated by ACV4. Next, in order to perform a direct comparison between the behavioral responses elicited by activating <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs alone to the behavioral response elicited by the entire complement of ORNs activated by ACV, we matched the spike rate elicited by ethyl acetate to that elicited by ACV (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). ACV4 activates <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs alone and expectedly does not elicit attraction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). At concentrations below 10<sup>-6</sup> (ETA7 and ETA8), ETA also activates <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs alone and fails to elicit attraction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). At higher concentrations ACV is attractive to the fly (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) because it activates more ORN classes (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E</a>). ETA, too, at concentrations 10<sup>-6</sup> or above activates multiple ORN classes. Consistent with the activation of more ORN classes, flies spend more time inside the odor-zone in the presence of ETA6."

ACV3 activates <i>Or59b-</i>ORNs in addition to <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs. Behaviorally, ACV3 modulates more motor parameters (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>); this is likely due to the activation of more ORN classes. Importantly, run duration and angular speed inside continue to be modulated because <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs are still activated. In addition, ACV3 also elicits a decrease in the time to return, a likely consequence of increased turn-rate outside the odor-zone. The number of parameters modulated increases further when the concentration is increased to ACV2. At this dilution, 10 parameters are affected (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) and the behavior appears qualitatively similar to the fly\u2019s behavior to ACV0. These data further support the hypothesis that different ORN classes modulate different motor parameters. At low odor concentration when only <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs are activated by the odor, only run duration and angular speed in the odor-zone is affected. At higher odor concentrations, consistent with the activation of more ORN classes more motor parameters are modulated."

To investigate this issue, we studied how the fly\u2019s ACV-evoked behavior changes in <i>Or42b<sup>EY14886</sup> </i>flies, a previously characterized null mutation in the Or42b receptor (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bhandawat et al., 2007</a>). <i>Or42b</i>-mutants were as attracted to ACV as control flies (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,E</a> -attraction index panel, p &gt;0.1 on a ranksum test); but some of the individual motor parameters were affected in the mutant. Two examples are shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>. The mutant flies had a significantly sharper distribution at the odor border (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B, C</a>). The change in run duration was significantly diminished in the mutants compared to the control flies (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>). Based on the fact that activating Or42b-ORNs resulted in an increase in angular speed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>,<a href=\"#fig7\">7C</a>), we expected a decrease in angular speed inside in the <i>Or42b</i> mutants. Although the median angular speed inside does decrease in the mutant, this decrease in angular speed is not significant. The lack of significant effect on angular speed implies that multiple ORNs activated by ACV can modulate angular speed. Overall, only 3 parameters out of 17 we investigated were affected in the mutants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). To confirm that these differences are odor-dependent and do not simply represent differences between the two genotypes, we compared the responses of control and mutant flies to the solvent control and found no differences ( <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, consistent with experiments in which we activated <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), a null mutation in the <i>Or42b</i> gene does not abolish the attraction of a fly to ACV. Instead, it selectively affects a small fraction of motor parameters."

Out of the 7 ORN classes activated by ACV0, 3 ORNs require a co-receptor, Ir8a. In the <i>Ir8a</i> mutant (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abuin et al., 2011</a>), these 3 ORN classes are non-functional and only 4 ORN classes activated by ACV0 are functional (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>).\u00a0The <i>Ir8a</i> mutant flies are still attracted to ACV0 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>, p &lt;0.0001 for both control and mutant in a ranksum test); there is a small but statistically insignificant decrease in attraction to ACV0 in the mutants compared to the control flies. However, there is a large change in the modulation of 5 motor parameters out of the 17 under study (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). The most striking difference between the wild-type and mutant is that the immediate modulation of speed upon entering the odor-zone is completely abolished in the mutant (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, p &gt;0.1 in a ranksum test for the mutants). Similarly, modulation of speed as the fly exits the odor-zone is also abolished (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Most of the parameters affected in the mutants are those that, in control flies, are affected as the fly crosses into the odor-zone or are modulated inside the odor-zone. Thus, it is likely that the <i>Ir8a</i>-mutant strongly affects changes in motor program which characterizes a fly\u2019s behavior in the presence of high concentration of food odor. Consistent with this idea, the time spent/transit decreases in the mutant without a significant change in time to return (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). The effect of Ir8a-ORNs shown above is not just on the fly\u2019s response to ACV but is also observed in response to other odors (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and supports the notion that different ORN classes affect different motor parameters."

Before the odor was presented, flies spent most of their time at the periphery (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>, left panel). In the presence of ACV the wild-type flies navigate to the odor source within seconds (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>, right panel). The <i>Ir8a</i>-mutant flies also navigated rapidly to the odor. But, the mutant flies dispersed from the odor source at a much faster rate than did the controls (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>). We measured the mean speeds in 5 radial bins and found that in the control flies, but not in <i>Ir8a</i>\u00a0mutant flies, speed decreased in bins closer to the odor source (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10F</a>).

As a result, the modulation of locomotion by a strong attractant is well understood. In contrast, researchers have not studied the effect of diverse odors on locomotion, nor the role of different ORN classes in odor-guided locomotion. In this study, we investigated both how different odors modulate locomotion and how modulation of locomotion by a natural odor (ACV) can be decomposed into modules affected by different ORN classes. We expected a characteristic motor program underlying a fly\u2019s attraction to odor; this\u00a0motor\u00a0program could be recruited with different efficiency depending on how attractive an odor is. Similarly, we anticipated that mutating different ORN classes activated by a strong attractant (like ACV) will simply reduce the attraction of the fly to that odor and thereby recruit the same motor program with less efficacy (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Our results do not support these expectations and instead support an alternate model of odor modulated locomotion in which different ORN classes affect different motor programs (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>); as a result, different odors with the same level of attraction can elicit very different motor programs.

One line of evidence is the low correlation among the 17 parameters modulated by ACV0: Of the 136 pair-wise correlations between these parameters, only 15 are significantly correlated (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with this lack of correlation between motor parameters, PCA performed on the 17-dimensional behavioral description shows that 7 principal components are necessary to explain 90% of the variance in the data. Another line of evidence is that different odors modulate different parameters. BUN3 decreases stop duration but not run duration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>); and ethyl acetate at 10<sup>-4</sup> dilution increases run duration but has no effect on stop duration ( <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a> ). These data imply that run duration and stop duration can be modulated independently. In addition, different odors have different effects on sharp and smooth turns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Experiments with <i>Ir8a</i> mutants suggest that the acute decrease in speed observed within the first second of encountering an odor might be yet another independently controlled parameter. Thus, it appears that at least 5 parameters: stop duration, run duration, sharp and smooth turns and acute changes in speed are all modulated independently. These results together support the idea that at least 5 independently controlled parameters underlie a fly\u2019s response to odors."

A limitation of our analysis is that it does not describe the dynamics of a fly\u2019s locomotion. Simple generative models like Hidden Markov Models which has been successfully used to model locomotion of simpler animals\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib23\">Gallagher et al., 2013</a>), are poor fits to a fly\u2019s tracks (data not shown) because of the complexity of a fly\u2019s locomotion. Ultimately, a hierarchical statistical model (such as a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model) is necessary to model both how a fly searches its environment and how odors modulate this search. Even without a hierarchical model, it is clear that processes which govern a fly\u2019s behavior outside the odor-zone are distinct from the processes which govern its behavior inside it. Consistent with this idea, most of the correlated parameters (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) correspond to the fly\u2019s behavior inside the odor-zone. Thus, a sharp decrease in speed as a fly enters the odor-zone is predictive of the overall decrease in speed, decrease in run duration and increased turning inside the odor-zone. It is likely that these 4 parameters form part of a coordinated response which constitutes a local search near high concentrations of food odor."

The problem of finding a distant odor source is certainly one important class of problems that the olfactory system solves. Studies across multiple species have shown that a conserved mechanism is in place to detect and track a particularly salient odor source over long distances (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johnsen and Teeter, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Porter et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">van Breugel and Dickinson, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kennedy, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Card\u00e9 and Willis, 2008</a>). But it is unlikely that tracking an odor source over long distances is the only problem an olfactory system is trying to solve. A more general class of problems faced by the olfactory system is to navigate a complex odor environment (<a href=\"#bib51\">Riffell et al., 2014</a>) consisting of multiple odor sources of varying salience. Navigating such a complex odor environment requires fine control over locomotion. It is likely that an animal\u2019s overall search strategy is under multimodal control and is flexibly linked to the overall visual, wind and odor environment. Our experiments suggest, surprisingly, that an important feature of this control is a precise modulation of motor parameters by the exact pattern of ORNs activated. This component of an animal\u2019s odor-guided locomotion has been overlooked so much so that in most experiments an\u00a0odor is treated as a 'scalar' which either turns on a motor program or changes the gain of an ongoing behavior."

For instance, in one study it was shown that the <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs plays an important role in attraction to a natural odor (<a href=\"#bib54\">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</a>). In contrast, another study finds that Or42b-ORNs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Knaden et al., 2012</a>) does not contribute to attraction at all and proposes a more modest contribution of a single ORN class to behavior. Consistent with the study in <a href=\"#bib38\">36</a> we show that activation of <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs is not enough to attract flies to an odor. Similarly, <i>Or42b</i> mutants are still strongly attracted to ACV suggesting a modest role for <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs in mediating attraction to odor. These differences in behavioral response to Or42b-ORNs in different labs could result from differences in behavioral paradigm or the state of the fly. Apart from <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs, we have also performed experiments in which we specifically activate <i>Or42a</i>-ORNs, <i>Or59b</i>-ORNs and <i>Or7a</i>-ORNs but failed to observe strong attraction. Thus, it is unlikely that activating a single ORN class will result in the strong attraction observed in the presence of a natural attractant. On the other hand, most odors which activate multiple ORN classes are somewhat attractive to a hungry fly suggesting that a mild attraction to odor can be elicited readily and does not require a unique or rarely activated combination of ORN classes. Similarly, attraction to natural odors is robust: even the <i>Ir8a</i> mutant is attracted to ACV. These findings together suggest that there are many redundant paths to odor-mediated attraction."

Although, activation of <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs by themselves does not elicit attraction, they have a significant effect on some motor parameters but not others. Another ORN class, <i>Or42a</i>-ORNs, affects another subset of motor parameters. These data suggest that individual ORN classes only affect a subset of motor parameters. Our experiments with different ACV concentrations show that as the ACV concentration is increased, more ORN classes are recruited which in turn result in the modulation of more motor parameters. These data led us to propose a fundamentally different model of odor-guided locomotion in which individual ORN classes affect a small number of motor parameters (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). The above model finds strong support in experiments aimed at dissecting the contribution of different ORN classes to the fly\u2019s response to ACV. We used three complementary approaches to activate subsets of ORNs: activation of known ORN classes using low concentrations of odors, different ACV concentrations and different OR mutants. We find that a given pattern of ORN activates the same motor parameters irrespective of how the ORNs are activated: activation of <i>Or42b</i>-ORNs by ACV4 or ETA8 decreases run duration and increases turning. Similarly, ACV does not elicit a decrease in speed until the concentration is high enough to activate Ir8a dependent ORNs; this observation is consistent with the strong effect of Ir8a-ORNs\u00a0on\u00a0speed. Overall, activation of different subsets of ORN which are all activated by ACV results in the modulation of different subsets of motor parameters."

It is tempting to conclude that different motor parameters are simply modulated by instantaneous summed activity from a subset of active ORN classes. This model is unlikely to be correct for all motor parameters. In particular, the principles underlying modulation of both sharp and smooth turns appear to be impervious to this simple analysis. This is reflected in the fact that although Or42b-ORN activation can affect angular speed, modulation of angular speed is not significantly affected in the <i>Or42b</i> mutants. Moreover, the facts that BUN3 modulates sharp turns but with little spatial specificity; and, ACV modulates it with great spatial specificity which is increased in the <i>Or42b</i> mutants indicate that a more complex rule than simple summation of ORN activities is at work. In sum, our work indicates that each motor parameter is modulated by a subset of ORNs; but, the relation between ORN classes and motor parameter could be simple for some parameters and complex for others. In the same vein, in this study in deriving the relation between ORN activation and behavior we have focused on which ORN classes are active. Future experiments will determine whether the level of activation and temporal characteristics of ORN spike response is relevant to behavioral output. To delineate the relationship between the spatio-temporal pattern of ORN activity and motor parameters, we need both a hierarchical model of a fly\u2019s locomotion and experiments aimed at understanding how inputs from different ORNs are integrated by higher-order neurons in the fly\u2019s brain."

These results further support the idea that the modulation of locomotion which leads to attraction to the odor source and modulation of locomotion which results in a fly\u2019s exploration of regions of high odor concentration are controlled independently. Our data suggests that activation of <i>Ir8a</i>-ORNs is important for initiating a local search characterized by short slow runs and frequent but short duration stops. This local search represents a part of an overall change in strategy that promotes a thorough search of a local area. Recent work has demonstrated that locomotion and proboscis extension to initiate feeding are antagonistically related\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib41\">Mann, et al., 2013</a>).

There are two competing models which account for flexible sensorimotor transformation. In the first and the dominant model, sensory processing creates an internal representation of the external world. Using this internal model, decision-making circuits can take a behavioral decision which is then executed by motor circuits. A student of neuroscience would be strongly inclined to this model after picking up any neuroscience textbook (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kandel, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Purves, 2008</a>). The strength and the allure of this model lie in the access to an internal representation. In this model, the versatility in animal behavior arises by endowing the nervous system with cognition - the ability to plan actions based on an internal model of the external world (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cruse, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Turvey and Fonseca, 2009</a>). This model has a centralized 'executive system or circuit' which takes into account sensory input and the state of the animal to plan action (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cruse, 2003</a>). But, efforts to create robots with such a subsystem have failed (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brooks, 1991</a>). Updating internal representations with every small act is just too slow."

In this model, the role of sensory systems is not to create an internal representation of the world but to extract behaviorally relevant features in the environment. A presumed limitation of the modular organization is that it would result in simple, stereotypical behaviors and hence this framework is considered relevant only for simple behaviors performed by simple organisms. Recent behavioral work has revealed that even animals with simple nervous systems are capable of complex behaviors. Fruit flies, for instance, can make use of both idiothetic\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib47\">Pick and Strauss, 2005</a>) and allothetic cues to navigate and also exhibit spatial memory(<a href=\"#bib44\">Ofstad et al., 2011</a>). At the other extreme, recent work in the mammalian retina has revealed that many retinal ganglion cells are feature detectors and only affect specific behaviors (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>).

This study describes the sensorimotor transformation for an average hungry fly over a 3\u00a0min exposure to odor.

After inserting the electrode, we used a UV-cured glue (KOA-300 from Kemxert Corporation) to glue the electrode to the eye. This electrode served both as a tether and as a ground electrode for sensillum recording. This electrode was mounted on a micromanipulator to position the fly at different places in the arena. Next, another electrode (a sharp electrode which is used to perform sensillum recording) was inserted into the fly\u2019s antennae. This second electrode was also mounted on a micromanipulator. This whole ensemble was moved around the arena. For each measurement, the electrode was held stationary at a given location and the odor was turned on. The ensemble must be horizontal and should also travel horizontally. For a given experiment, the electrode needs to be stable for all measurements. This is because the value of EAGs strongly depends on the place and depth of insertion. Each measurement was repeated 4 times a given location. Because absolute EAG values vary widely from experiment-to-experiment, the values were normalized by dividing by the peak response obtained inside the odor-zone. The normalized response in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> is obtained by integrating over a 15 s window after odor on. This window was chosen because the response reaches a plateau within 15 s."

The resulting video was used to extract a fly\u2019s position. We subtracted the average frame from each frame to obtain a background-subtracted video in which the fly is the only bright object in an otherwise dark background. The position of the fly was obtained as the centroid of the largest bright object (usually the only bright object) in a frame. When the fly was directly under the edge of the air tube, background-subtracted video showed two separate objects instead of one, which caused errors in tracking. To correct these errors, the centroid was calculated as the center of both objects when the fly was near the edge of the air tube. We checked auto tracking by measuring the fly\u2019s instantaneous velocity. Frames on which the instantaneous velocity exceeded 3 mm/s represented frames where the fly\u2019s position had been incorrectly assigned. These errors in tracking were less than 1% and they were manually corrected. Lastly we transformed the track such that it represents the view from a single camera placed directly above the arena.

Moreover because we used the fly\u2019s centroid (typically on the thorax or abdomen of a fly) instead of actual antenna location, the fly could be at 1.65 cm (adding 0.15 cm for the half-length of the fly) facing radially inwards and still be experiencing odor. In the presence of ACV, flies often stopped just before entering the odor-zone. For ACV at 10<sup>-2</sup> and 10<sup>-1</sup>, these stop events occur within 1.65 cm of the arena center. In case of pure ACV, many flies stopped outside 1.65 cm, so we assumed that centroid locations at this point was a better measurement of the actual odor boundary.

A hole with 1.5 mm diameter was drilled in the middle of the arena to create an odor delivery port. Odors were delivered by attaching an odor vial below the hole. Odors entered the arena passively, i.e. there was no airstream carrying the odor. The chamber was stabilized with magnets which held the chamber firmly in place against a metallic ring stand. Experiments were performed in dark under infrared illumination. A camera was placed 25 cm above the chamber. The chamber was painted black; a fly was the only bright object. Tracking was performed as in the ring assay."

Underlying the fly\u2019s attraction to apple cider vinegar, both its time to return to the odor zone and time spent inside changed. This implies that the change in fly\u2019s behavior is not limited to the time that a fly is actually in the presence of odor (i.e. in the odor zone). We also observed that a fly\u2019s speed increases outside the odor zone in the presence of odor and decreases inside. Thus, the same parameter can change in different ways outside and inside the odor zone. Therefore, we investigated the change in a given parameter both inside and outside the odor zone. In addition, we observed that flies sometimes showed acute behavioral changes on crossing the odor boundary, so we added certain parameters to depict the acute changes (e.g. speed crossing in)."

First, the modulation of many parameters depended on the value of that parameter before odor onset. For instance, if one fly repeatedly went inside the odor-zone before odor onset, it would likely do so even when the odor is turned on. To account for these intrinsic differences in a fly\u2019s tendency, we are reporting normalized parameters. Second, modulation of a given motor parameter by an odor can result from either the odor itself or the solvent control. Therefore, to establish whether a given parameter is modulated by a given odor, we will perform statistical tests between the distributions of a given parameter in the solvent control versus its distribution in the presence of the odor."

It does so by looking for the eigenvalues and vectors of the between-groups covariance matrix 'in the metric of' the within-groups covariance matrix. If <b>B</b> is the within-group covariance matrix and W is the within-groups covariance matrix, then the canonical variates are obtained by solving the equation (<b>B</b><sup>-1</sup><b>W</b>) a = 0 or an eigen decomposition of <b>W</b><sup>-1</sup><b>B</b>. Unlike PCA, the number of dimensions does not equal the number of variables. Rather the number of dimensions is one less than the number of groups. For comparison between two groups, all the 'variance' is captured in a single dimension, leading to simple one dimensional representation we have used in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>,<a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and Supplementary <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. To show that the separation between flies\u2019 behavior to two odors along the first canonical variate is not just an artifact of over-fitting, we randomized the odor label 50000 times and calculated the median distance between odor representations in each iteration. To assess significance, we measured the fraction of randomized trial with median &gt; original median."

Thus, two \"attractive\" odorants, apple cider vinegar (ACV) and 2-butanone at 10<sup>-3</sup> dilution (BUN3), trigger responses and motor patterns that are quite different from one another. Using a clever behavioral arena in which they are able to create sharp odor boundaries they measure multiple (largely independent) parameters of locomotion that contribute to odor 'attraction behavior' (seeking and maintaining contact with attractive odors such as those in foodstuffs). The system allows for the stimulation and genetic elimination of specific ORNs and thus allows a powerful dissection of behavior. They find that rather than a simple relationship between a specific ORN class and attraction behavior a more complicated picture emerges that suggests a modular organization of olfactory guided attraction. Specifically they find that in response to odors, flies modulate a surprisingly large number of motor parameters, similarly attractive odors elicit changes in different motor parameters, and different ORN classes modulate different subset of motor parameters. The experiments are thorough, well controlled, and appropriately analyzed with relevant statistics."

We used a parameter similar to the performance index, 'attraction index', as a measure of the relative change in time a fly spends inside the odor zone between before and during the odor stimulation periods.\" This is inadequate.

This is unlikely to be the case because ETA7 and ACV2 elicit different behavioral responses despite activating Or42b-ORNs to the same level. Besides, mutating Or42b-ORNs eliminates all responses to ETA7/8 but not to ACV0/2. The simplest explanation is that other ORNs activated by ACV are important.
