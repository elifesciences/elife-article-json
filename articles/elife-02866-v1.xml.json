To search for related machinery, we developed a structure-based bioinformatics tool, and identified the core subunits of TSET, a 'missing link' between the APs and COPI. Studies in <i>Dictyostelium</i> indicate that TSET is a heterohexamer, with two associated scaffolding proteins. TSET is non-essential in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, but may act in plasma membrane turnover, and is essentially identical to the recently described TPLATE complex, TPC. However, whereas TPC was reported to be plant-specific, we can identify a full or partial complex in every eukaryotic supergroup. An evolutionary path can be deduced from the earliest origins of the heterotetramer/scaffold coat to its multiple manifestations in modern organisms, including the mammalian muniscins, descendants of the TSET medium subunits. Thus, we have uncovered the machinery for an ancient and widespread pathway, which provides new insights into early eukaryotic evolution."

To search for related machinery, we developed a structure-based bioinformatics tool, and identified the core subunits of TSET, a 'missing link' between the APs and COPI. Studies in <i>Dictyostelium</i> indicate that TSET is a heterohexamer, with two associated scaffolding proteins. TSET is non-essential in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, but may act in plasma membrane turnover, and is essentially identical to the recently described TPLATE complex, TPC. However, whereas TPC was reported to be plant-specific, we can identify a full or partial complex in every eukaryotic supergroup. An evolutionary path can be deduced from the earliest origins of the heterotetramer/scaffold coat to its multiple manifestations in modern organisms, including the mammalian muniscins, descendants of the TSET medium subunits. Thus, we have uncovered the machinery for an ancient and widespread pathway, which provides new insights into early eukaryotic evolution."

Key to this transition was the ability to generate intracellular membrane compartments and the trafficking pathways that interconnect them, mediated in part by the heterotetrameric adaptor complexes, APs 1\u20135 and COPI (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dacks et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Field and Dacks, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hirst et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Koumandou et al., 2013</a>). In mammals, APs 1 and 2 and COPI are essential for viability, while mutations in the other APs cause severe genetic disorders (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boehm and Bonifacino, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hirst et al., 2013</a>). The AP and COPI complexes share a similar architecture, due to common ancestry predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). All six complexes consist of two large subunits of \u223c100 kD, a medium subunit of \u223c50 kD, and a small subunit of \u223c20 kD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Their function is to select cargo for packaging into transport vesicles, and together with membrane-deforming scaffolding proteins such as clathrin and the COPI B-subcomplex, they facilitate the trafficking of proteins and lipids between membrane compartments in the secretory and endocytic pathways. The recent discovery of the evolutionarily ancient AP-5 complex, found on late endosomes and lysosomes, added a new dimension to models of the endomembrane system, and raised the possibility that other undetected membrane-trafficking complexes might exist (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hirst et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, we set out in search of additional members of the AP/COPI subunit families."

Using HHpred to analyse every protein in the RefSeq database from 15 organisms, covering a broad span of eukaryotic diversity, we built a \u2018reverse HHpred\u2019 database. This database contains potential homologues for &gt;300,000 different proteins (<a href=\"http://reversehhpred.cimr.cam.ac.uk/\">http://reversehhpred.cimr.cam.ac.uk</a>), and can be searched with structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

Secondary structure predictions confirmed that the new family members have similar folds to their counterparts in the AP complexes and COPI (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Only one of these proteins had been characterised functionally: TPLATE (NP_186827.2), an <i>Arabidopsis</i> protein related to the AP \u03b2 subunits and \u03b2-COP, found in a microscopy-based screen for proteins involved in mitosis and localised to the cell plate (<a href=\"#bib40\">Van Damme et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Van Damme et al., 2011</a>). There is some variability between orthologous subunits in different organisms: for instance, <i>Arabidopsis</i> has added an SH3 domain to the C-terminal end of its \u2018\u03b3\u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03b6\u2019 large subunit, while <i>Dictyostelium</i> has lost the \u03bc homology domain (MHD) at the end of its medium subunit; and in general there seems to be much less selective pressure on these genes than on those encoding other AP/COPI family members (e.g., the AP-1 \u03b21 subunits are 58.01% identical in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and <i>Arabidopsis</i>, while the new \u03b2 family members are only 14.63% identical)."

To investigate the function of TSET in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, we disrupted the TSPOON gene by replacing most of the coding sequence with a selectable marker (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Surprisingly, the resulting knockout cells grew at least as fast a control axenic strain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a> shows the mean generation time); and differentiation also appeared normal, with fruiting bodies forming under appropriate stimuli (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Uptake of FITC-dextran, an assay for fluid phase endocytosis, was unimpaired in the TSPOON knockout cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>); however, uptake of FM1-43, a membrane marker, was slower than in the control (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a> shows the time taken to internalise the entire surface area), indicating that TSET plays a role in plasma membrane turnover, consistent with studies on <i>Arabidopsis</i>.

The <i>Arabidopsis</i> pulldowns did not contain any proteins resembling secG or the vacuolins, supporting our hypothesis that these proteins are add-ons to the core heterohexamer. However, <i>Arabidopsis</i> TSET is associated with two additional proteins containing EH domains, which we did not find in our <i>Dictyostelium</i> pulldowns. Some of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> pulldowns also brought down components of the machinery for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, including clathrin itself. Although we also found clathrin and associated proteins in our <i>Dictyostelium</i> immunoprecipitates, these proteins were equally abundant in control immunoprecipitates from non-GFP-expressing cells, indicating that they were contaminants. The differences in proteins that coprecipitate with TSET in the two organisms are probably a reflection of functional differences: TSET knockouts in <i>Arabidopsis</i> are lethal and knockdowns profoundly affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while TSET knockdowns in <i>Dictyostelium</i> produce a very mild phenotype."

Consequently, after analyses of the individual subunits (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1\u20137</a>), we performed a phylogenetic analysis on the concatenated set of the four core subunits for direct comparison of TSET with the other AP and COPI complexes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s8\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 8</a>). This provided moderate support for TSET as a clade, but strong resolution excluding it from the APs and COPI, as well as backbone resolution between the heterotetramer clades. Thus, TSET is clearly an ancient component of the eukaryotic membrane-trafficking system, distinct from the known heterotetramers."

Numbers indicate posterior probabilities for MrBayes and PhyloBayes and maxium-likelihood bootstrap values for PhyML and RAxML, in that order. (<b>B</b>) Schematic diagram of TSET. (<b>C</b>) Possible evolution of the three families of heterotetramers: TSET, APs, and COPI. We propose that the earliest ancestral complex was a likely a heterotrimer or a heterohexamer formed from two identical heterotrimers, containing large (red), small (yellow), and scaffolding (blue) subunits. All three of these proteins were composed of known ancient building blocks of the membrane-trafficking system (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vedovato et al., 2009</a>): \u03b1-solenoid domains in both the large and scaffolding subunits; two \u03b2-propellers in the scaffolding subunit; and a longin domain forming the small subunit. The gene encoding the large subunit then duplicated and mutated to generate the two distinct types of large subunits (red and magenta), and the gene encoding the small subunit also duplicated and mutated (yellow and orange), with one of the two proteins (orange) acquiring a \u03bc homology domain (MHD) to form the ancestral heterotetramer, as proposed by Boehm and Bonifacino (12). However, the scaffolding subunit remained a homodimer. Upon diversification into three separate families, the scaffolding subunit duplicated independently in TSET and COPI, giving rise to TTRAY1 and TTRAY2 in TSET, and to \u03b1- and \u03b2\u2032-COP in COPI. COPI also acquired a new subunit, \u03b5-COP (purple). The scaffolding subunit may have been lost in the ancestral AP complex, as indicated in the diagram; however, AP-5 is tightly associated with two other proteins, SPG11 and SPG15, and the relationship of SPG11 and SPG15 to TTRAY/B-COPI remains unresolved, so it is possible that SPG11 and SPG15 are highly divergent descendants of the original scaffolding subunits. The other AP complexes are free heterotetramers when in the cytosol, but membrane-associated AP-1 and AP-2 interact with another scaffold, clathrin; and AP-3 has also been proposed to interact transiently with a protein with similar architecture, Vps41 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Rehling et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cabrera et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Asensio et al., 2013</a>). So far no scaffold has been proposed for AP-4. Although the order of emergence of TSET and COP relative to adaptins is unresolved, our most recent analyses indicate that, contrary to previous reports (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hirst et al., 2011</a>), AP-5 diverged basally within the adaptin clade, followed by AP-3, AP-4, and APs 1 and 2, all prior to the LECA. This still suggests a primordial bridging of the secretory and phagocytic systems prior to emergence of a <i>trans</i>-Golgi network. The muniscins arose much later, in ancestral opisthokonts, from a translocation of the TSET MHD-encoding sequence to a position immediately downstream from an F-BAR domain-encoding sequence. Another translocation occurred in plants, where an SH3 domain-coding sequence was inserted at the 3\u2032 end of the TSAUCER-coding sequence.

Together, these findings imply that the ancestor of the TSET, COPI, and AP complexes was a heterohexamer rather than a heterotetramer, consisting of five different proteins, with the two scaffolding proteins present as two identical copies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). These scaffolding subunits then duplicated independently in COPI and TSET. The ancestral AP complex may have lost its original scaffolding subunits, although AP-5, the first AP to branch away, is closely associated with SPG11, a \u03b2-propeller + \u03b1-solenoid protein whose relationship to the TTRAYs and B-COPI is as yet unclear. None of the other APs has any closely associated proteins with this architecture, but AP-1 and AP-2 transiently interact with clathrin, and there may also be a transient association between AP-3 and another \u03b2-propeller + \u03b1-solenoid protein, Vps41 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Rehling et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cabrera et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Asensio et al., 2013</a>)."

None of the subunits has a full orthologue in opisthokonts (animals and fungi), indicating secondary loss in the line leading to humans. However, the C-terminal domain of TCUP is homologous to the C-terminal domains of the muniscins, opisthokont-specific proteins (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gadeyne et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s10\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 10</a>). This suggests that in opisthokonts, the TCUP gene retained its 3\u2032 end, which then combined with a new 5\u2032 end encoding an F-BAR domain to generate the muniscin family (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These include the vertebrate proteins FCHo1/2 and the yeast protein Syp1, important players in the endocytic pathway (<a href=\"#bib31\">Reider et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Henne et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cocucci et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Umasankar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mayers et al., 2013</a>). The muniscins constitute one of eight families of MHD proteins in humans, and the only family whose evolutionary origin was unexplained until now. The present study indicates not only that the muniscins are homologous to TCUP, but also that they are the sole surviving remnants of the full TSET complex that existed in our pre-opisthokont ancestors."

This is consistent with the uneven distribution of the individual components (in contrast to the all-or-nothing distribution of AP-5), the additional apparently lineage-specific binding partners in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, and the acquisition of extra domains (e.g., F-BAR in opisthokonts and SH3 in plants) adding lineage-specific function."

Like <i>Arabidopsis</i> TSET, the muniscins interact with EH domain-containing proteins and participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Reider et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Henne et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cocucci et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Umasankar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mayers et al., 2013</a>). <i>Dictyostelium</i> has lost its TCUP MHD, and it seems likely that concomitant with this loss, it also lost some of TSET's binding partners and functions. Nevertheless, we suspect that TSET may predate clathrin-mediated endocytosis, for two reasons. First, AP-1 and AP-2, the two AP complexes that function together with clathrin, are the most recent additions to the AP family (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>); and second, TSET already has its own \u03b2-propeller + \u03b1-solenoid scaffold, so it is not clear why it would need clathrin as well. Thus, the interaction between TSET and the clathrin pathway may have evolved considerably later than TSET itself, although still pre-LECA. It is tempting to speculate that TSET was part of the original endocytic machinery, which then became redundant in some organisms as the clathrin pathway took over."

Using this tool, we were able to find the four core subunits of an ancient complex belonging to the same family as the APs and COPI. This ancient complex, TSET, is therefore both the answer to the question of the origin of the last set of MHD proteins in humans, and a major new piece of the puzzle to be incorporated alongside the other membrane-trafficking machinery, as we delve into the history of the eukaryotic cell."

Each of the faa files was then compared to the pdb70 databank using the hhsearch program from the above suite. The files were tested using the default parameters. Once each protein sequence was tested, the output file was parsed and the hits were extracted and then inserted into a mysql database. The database is searchable by keywords in PDB entries, and therefore is limited to searches where the structure of a given domain structure has been solved. The database is accessible using the link <a href=\"http://reversehhpred.cimr.cam.ac.uk/\">http://reversehhpred.cimr.cam.ac.uk</a>, and searches can be initiated using keywords. Should the link become unavailable, or if you are interested in hosting this yourself please email <a href=\"mailto:jpn25@cam.ac.uk\">jpn25@cam.ac.uk</a> for more information. A conceptually similar database, \u2018BackPhyre\u2019, has independently been generated, using Phyre (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</a>) rather than HHpred as a starting point to identify homologues of known proteins based on predicted structural similarities. Like reverse HHpred, BackPhyre is able to find three of the four TSET subunits in <i>Arabidopsis</i>; however, the only eukaryotes represented in BackPhyre are <i>A. thaliana</i>, <i>D. melanogaster</i>, <i>H. sapiens</i>, <i>M. musculus</i>, <i>P. falciparum</i>, and <i>S. cerevisiae</i>; and without additional organisms, such as <i>D. discoideum</i> and <i>N. gruberi</i>, we would not have been able to find the entire TSET complex."

These structures span different domains found within the subunits. For each search, a list was output of any proteins found to contain structural homology. Included in this information are the precise amino acids encompassing the region of similarity, the probability score, and most importantly the \u2018result number\u2019. A protein with a \u2018result number\u2019 of \u20181\u2019 means that there was no other structure in the PDB database that it is more like. Since multiple structures for the various subunits were used, we could also factor in the number of times a particular protein was identified in a search (\u2018repeats\u2019). These parameters were used as key pieces of evidence to determine how likely a hit in these searches would be. Once the primary data were outputted, all other manipulations were performed in Excel. For the large subunits there were 11 data sets (the 11 structures used to search for homologues), and for the medium/small subunits there were six data sets. The data manipulation was standardised at this point, and the following steps performed to assimilate the data. The data sets were sorted by result number to preclude anything with a result number of &gt;50 (this means that there are 49 other structures in the PDB database that this protein is more similar to). Duplicates, where a protein was identified in multiple searches, were removed with the highest ranking (in \u2018result\u2019 terms) kept, and the number of times it was identified recorded in a new column (\u2018repeats\u2019). The results were the ordered with the lowest \u2018Result number\u2019 and the highest \u2018Probability\u2019 to give a final list of proteins (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1, 2</a>). Generally only proteins with a \u2018Result number\u2019 &lt;10, \u2018Probability\u2019 &gt;50%, at least 100 amino acids of homology (\u2018thstt\u2019 to \u2018thend\u2019), and \u2018Repeats\u2019 at least two times were considered to be real hits. For ease of visualisation, only proteins with Result number &lt;10 or \u2018Repeats\u2019 &gt;2 are shown, and other proteins of interest (e.g., FCHo1, Syp1) with Result number &lt;10 that did not fit the criteria listed above are greyed out. The \u2018IDs\u2019 have been deduced using NCBI BLAST searches, and have not been experimentally verified. Where the identity is ambiguous (such as the identity of a \u03b2-adaptin), a shared homology is suggested."

MrBayes and RAxML were used as above. Raw phylogenetic trees were converted into figures using Adobe Illustrator CS4. The models of amino acid sequence evolution are provided in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The database identifiers of all sequences and their abbreviations and figure annotations are provided in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>. All alignments are available in <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>."

Only using a clever 'reverse HHpred' strategy did the authors find the complex, since its sequence conservation is too weak for identification using more classical methods (Blast or the like). After biochemically characterizing the complex the authors go on with an in-depth phylogenetic analysis, which makes the clearest case yet that all APs, F-COPI, and TSET likely diverged from a common ancestor already present in LECA. This is a significant advance in our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic life in general, and vesicle-mediated trafficking within the endomembrane system in particular. Importantly, this study also corrects the highly visible recently published misconception of a plant-specific adaptor complex (Gadeyne et al., Cell 2014)."

We have now taken out the word \u201cnew\u201d when referring to our tool, both in the Introduction and in the Conclusions; and in the Materials and methods section, we now compare and contrast reverse HHpred and BackPhyre. Interestingly, like reverse HHpred, BackPhyre was able to find three of the four core TSET subunits in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, and in both cases the subunit that couldn\u2019t be found was TSAUCER. However, because reverse HHpred contains sequences from many more eukaryotes than BackPhyre, were able to find TSAUCER in both <i>Naegleria</i> and <i>Dictyostelium</i>, neither of which is represented in BackPhyre. So without HHpred, we would never have been able to identify the entire heterotetramer bioinformatically. Because the BackPhyre website encourages users to submit requests for additional genomes to be added, eventually it may be possible to use reverse HHpred and BackPhyre as complementary tools for searching the entire diversity of eukaryotes."

Thus, we have removed all mention of protocoatomers per se, while still pointing out that this type of architecture is commonly used when building the scaffolding part of a coat, and still citing the Devos et al. paper that first made this point. We do suspect that at least some of the coat scaffolds have a common origin. For instance, an HHpred analysis of Sec31 pulls out \u03b2\u2019-COP immediately after Sec31 itself, although the relationship between clathrin heavy chain, Sec31, and COPI appears to be more distant. An in-depth phylogenetic analysis should shed more light on the evolution of these proteins, but for the time being, we agree that it is best to use the word \u201cscaffold\u201d rather than \u201cprotocoatomer\u201d."

However, by TIRF microscopy, we see discrete puncta, especially in the lower-expressing cells. This provides further evidence for TSPOON acting at the plasma membrane in <i>Dictyostelium</i> as well as in plants."
