                    "text": "Transcription occurs in stochastic bursts. Early models based upon RNA hybridisation studies suggest bursting dynamics arise from alternating inactive and permissive states. Here we investigate bursting mechanism in live cells by quantitative imaging of actin gene transcription, combined with molecular genetics, stochastic simulation and probabilistic modelling. In contrast to early models, our data indicate a continuum of transcriptional states, with a slowly fluctuating initiation rate converting the gene between different levels of activity, interspersed with extended periods of inactivity. We place an upper limit of 40 s on the lifetime of fluctuations in elongation rate, with initiation rate variations persisting an order of magnitude longer. TATA mutations reduce the accessibility of high activity states, leaving the lifetime of on- and off-states unchanged. A continuum or spectrum of gene states potentially enables a wide dynamic range for cell responses to stimuli."

Early models based upon RNA hybridisation studies suggest bursting dynamics arise from alternating inactive and permissive states. Here we investigate bursting mechanism in live cells by quantitative imaging of actin gene transcription, combined with molecular genetics, stochastic simulation and probabilistic modelling. In contrast to early models, our data indicate a continuum of transcriptional states, with a slowly fluctuating initiation rate converting the gene between different levels of activity, interspersed with extended periods of inactivity. We place an upper limit of 40 s on the lifetime of fluctuations in elongation rate, with initiation rate variations persisting an order of magnitude longer. TATA mutations reduce the accessibility of high activity states, leaving the lifetime of on- and off-states unchanged. A continuum or spectrum of gene states potentially enables a wide dynamic range for cell responses to stimuli."

In the one state model, transcription occurs with a constant probability, which for moderately and strongly transcribed genes, will generate a low variance in their total transcribed RNA per cell. In some contexts, notably budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zenklusen et al., 2008</a>), the variance in RNA abundance measured by single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridisation (smFISH) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Femino et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mueller et al., 2013</a>) can fit this one state scenario, where the distribution of RNA per cell is well characterised by a Poisson distribution. In many other contexts, the one state model does not fit the smFISH data, with measured RNA abundance showing too much variability between cells than can be produced by a constantly active gene. To explain this increased variance, the more complex random telegraph (or two state) model is often invoked (<a href=\"#bib39\">Paulsson, 2005</a>). In this model, the gene switches stochastically between an active state, where mRNA production occurs with constant probability per unit time, and an inactive state, with no mRNA production. The extra state increases the potential variability in output from cells, and can therefore predict the observed extra spread in transcript abundance in the cell population (<a href=\"#bib47\">Singer et al., 2014</a>)."

However, these dynamic properties are usually inferred from a population distribution at a single time point, assuming each cell is part of a homogeneous population with fixed values of the switching rates, transcript production rate and transcript lifetime. In other words, the perception has emerged that transcriptional bursting is a product of molecular noise, rather than a process responsive to the demands of the cell. A rethink is required, not least because of recent work demonstrating burst size and frequency are quantities that can be modulated by extracellular signals (<a href=\"#bib30\">Molina et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Corrigan and Chubb, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Senecal et al., 2014</a>) and cell properties such as volume and cell cycle stage (<a href=\"#bib36\">Padovan-Merhar et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Muramoto et al., 2010</a>).

To directly measure features such as burst size and burst frequency requires data capture of complete sequences of bursts, rather than snapshots. Imaging transcriptional output in living cells is possible using RNA detection systems based upon the binding of a bacteriophage coat protein to stem loops of RNA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chubb et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bertrand et al., 1998</a>). An array of sequence encoding stem loops, such as MS2 or PP7, is inserted after the promoter of a gene of interest. When the gene is transcribed, the nascent RNA stem loops are detected with a fluorescent MS2 (MCP) or PP7 (PCP) coat protein, which is constitutively co-expressed. The system is visualized using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, with a nuclear spot indicating active transcription of the gene of interest. The intensity of the spot reflects the instantaneous nascent RNA load at the gene and changes in spot intensity reflect how the RNA load fluctuates over time. These tools allow direct observation of the dynamics of transcription regulation, revealing insights into the mechanics of Poissonian transcription (<a href=\"#bib26\">Larson et al., 2011</a>) and developmental regulation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Corrigan and Chubb, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Muramoto et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Garcia et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Stevense et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bothma et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lucas et al., 2013</a>).

Here, the exponential nature of the 'ON' and 'OFF' time durations of the transcript spot was related to the two state model, with the exponential behaviour proposed to reflect rate-limiting steps in transitions between the active and inactive states. Although this is an appealing inference, how spot fluctuations actually reflect the dynamics of the transcription machinery is unclear."

We use a probabilistic approach to infer dynamics at the molecular level from fluctuations in spot intensity. We make quantitative measurements of the transcription site RNA abundance and the retention time of nascent RNA at the gene. We use these measurements to train candidate hidden Markov models to describe the underlying initiation of RNA polymerases, and find that a spectrum or continuum of initiation rates describes experimental data more accurately than a binary off/on model or discrete levels of activity. Finally, we investigate how the processes of transcription elongation and initiation contribute to the transitions of the gene over this spectrum of activity states."

Transcription continues after the MS2 loops into the coding sequence, then native terminator, to generate a full length transcript of around 2.5\u00a0kb. We visualized the resulting transcription dynamics using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and extracted time series of spot intensities using custom-built software integrating both cell tracking and spot detection (<a href=\"#bib11\">Corrigan and Chubb, 2014</a>).

Additional features, such as the number of gene states, and termination/release rate (the rate at which the RNA leaves the gene) were omitted at this stage. By defining a signal detection threshold above which a spot is determined to be present, we calculated the pulse and interval length distributions from the simulated data. The average pulse duration depends strongly on the initiation rate, but was also substantially sensitive to the detection threshold and frame interval specified in the simulations. The pulse duration distribution had exponential distributions at long timescales, with deviations at very short timescales (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This was surprising, as the exponential distribution was previously inferred to support the two-state model. Here, our simulations clearly show such a distribution can arise from a more simple one-state scenario."

This probability is independent of the duration for which the pulse has been sustained. It is tempting to infer from this probability the rate of switching from an active to an inactive state of a two state gene. However, with exponential behaviour observed for our simulation of constant polymerase initiation rates (this is only one state), it is necessary to consider additional contributions to the likelihood of a spot disappearing from one imaging frame to the next."

By considering the rate of initiation of polymerases at the start of the gene and the number of RNA stem loops produced by a polymerase as it moves along the gene, we calculate the joint probability distribution linking the spot intensity in the previous frame with the current frame. (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, full details in the appendix). The theory successfully predicts the characteristic exponential timescale of pulse duration in terms of the one state model, incorporating the polymerase elongation rate, the frame interval and threshold of spot detection. In simple terms, the pulse duration reflects the balance between polymerase initiation and elongation or termination - in order for a spot to remain present in the next frame, a sufficient number of new polymerases must be initiated to replace the loss of spot intensity from cleaved RNA leaving the transcription site. Intuitively, high initiation rates are likely to give rise to large numbers of initiations per frame, giving long pulses. Increasing the threshold of spot detection decreases the likelihood of sufficient initiations and thus decreases the pulse duration. These predictions are in agreement with the Monte Carlo simulations of the MS2 system (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The initiation and elongation rates have approximately inverse effects, with initiation scaling directly with spot intensity (as expected intuitively) and elongation scaling inversely. The effect of slow elongation increasing spot intensity can be thought of in terms of a polymerase 'traffic jam', with several polymerases building up behind a slower one, causing a build up of nascent RNA on the gene\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Darzacq et al., 2007</a>). Additionally, the frame interval of observation influences the effective pulse duration, as longer frame intervals increase the likelihood of a gap between pulses being missed between frames. Overall, this theory shows that the length of time for which a spot is visible is not simply related to switches between proposed gene states in two state models and explains the dependence of the pulse duration on the imaging signal-to-noise (<a href=\"#bib34\">Muramoto et al., 2010</a>) and frame interval (<a href=\"#bib29\">Masaki et al., 2013</a>)."

As depicted by the cartoon in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, a fluctuation in intensity might be consistent with either the one state (Poisson, top) or multi-state (bottom) models. Without calibration of the intensity fluctuations in terms of numbers of RNAs, it is difficult to discount either model. One strategy that can be used is an autocorrelation analysis, which measures the magnitude and timescale of intensity fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Larson et al., 2011</a>). The autocorrelation measures the ratio of intensity fluctuations relative to the mean intensity. For a Poisson (one state) gene, where initiations behave independently of the previous or subsequent polymerase, this ratio is related to the average number of bound polymerases, allowing the initiation rate to be estimated. This was previously used to infer the initiation and elongation rates from a <i>POL1</i> promoter inserted upstream of the <i>GLT1</i> gene in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib26\">Larson et al., 2011</a>), specifying the time for the correlation to decay to zero as the time for which a single polymerase contributes to the spot intensity."

The additional slow decay means the RNA level at the gene is correlated beyond the dwell time at the gene of a single RNA. This argues against a Poisson model and indicates a model with two or more transcription states would better describe <i>act5</i> transcription. If the autocorrelation is recalculated using only frames where a spot is present, the slow decay remains, suggesting that the active periods where a spot is present are not defined by a single constant initiation rate; in other words there are multiple 'ON' states. By subtracting a linear estimate of the long timescale decay from the autocorrelation, we calculated estimates of the RNA dwell time and polymerase load on the gene (<a href=\"#bib26\">Larson et al., 2011</a>). The point where the autocorrelation deviates from the long decay gives an approximation of the dwell time as 190 \u00b1 20\u2009s. The average number of polymerases contributing to the intensity is estimated from the magnitude of the deviation at zero lag time as 20\u201327 polymerases.

As an independent measure of dwell time, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements on MS2 spots (<a href=\"#bib35\">Muramoto et al., 2012</a>). The MCP-RNA interaction is stable (<a href=\"#bib28\">Maiuri et al., 2011</a>), so recovery of the spot intensity after bleaching is determined by transcription of new MS2 loops. In the absence of photobleaching, spot intensities fluctuate over time, therefore a bleached spot is not expected to recover to its pre-bleach intensity. We therefore normalized the curves based on the recovered intensity. Recovery of a single endogenous gene is highly stochastic, as expected from simulations of photobleaching and recovery (see below). Therefore, we averaged over 20\u201330 cells in order to extract the typical RNA dwell time. The average recovery curve was fit to a processive polymerase model of the intensity recovery to estimate the elongation rate and termination time (full details in the appendix). We calculated the dwell time for three different gene constructs, with the MS2 loops integrated into the 5\u2019 gene region, the 3\u2019 region, and replacing the entire <i>actin5</i> coding region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The dwell time for the 5\u2019 insertion was longer than for the other insertions, as expected as the polymerase will continue to transcribe after the MS2 array, whereas with the other two cell lines, termination will occur immediately upon completion of synthesis of the array. Using the difference in dwell times and assuming a constant rate of elongation across the gene, we calculate the elongation rate as 22 nt.s<sup>-1</sup> and termination time as 60-70\u00a0s. This gives a total dwell time of around 170\u00a0s, for the 5\u2019 MS2 insertion, roughly in agreement with the autocorrelation-derived approximation on the same allele."

By extension from the two-state model, we define a 'state' as a configuration with a single constant (Poisson) initiation rate. In terms of transcription dynamics, the hidden state corresponds to the underlying initiation rate of the system. This rate cannot be observed directly and instead must be inferred from measurements of the transcription site intensity, which is related probabilistically to the initiation rate. Using standard HMM techniques, the magnitudes and dynamics of the underlying initiation rate can be optimized to maximize the probability of generating the experimental data from the model. For the case of the MS2 system, the spot intensity does not depend only on the instantaneous initiation rate, because polymerases initiated in previous frames are still present on the gene and also contribute to the spot intensity. To take account of these polymerase contributions, we constructed a model (full details in the appendix, architecture depicted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) with hidden states representing the initiation rate (blue circles) and the number of polymerases initiated (orange circles), inferred from the sequence of transcription site intensities (green squares). A benefit of our two-layer HMM framework is that we explicity model the polymerases uncoupled from transitions between states of gene activity. This means that the distribution of polymerases initiated in each state can be estimated (see below)."

While 1- and 2-state models do not adequately describe the data, the quality of the fit continues to significantly increase as the number of states increases from 3 upwards.

As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, elongation rates fluctuating independently for each polymerase cannot produce any differences in the recovery curves. For the density of polymerases on the gene for typical spot intensities, fluctuations of individual polymerases are suppressed by catching up and being blocked by a polymerase immediately downstream. This results in a bulk polymerase elongation rate close to the lower speed of 10 nucleotides/s. Thus independent fluctuations in polymerase elongation cannot account for the fluctuations in spot intensity in the continuum model."

As in experiments, the lowest intensity recoveries show a high degree of noise, due to the small normalisation factor. As the timescale of the elongation fluctuations becomes shorter, the difference between the recoveries is reduced, as variability in the elongation rate is blurred out by faster transitions. The point at which the simulated data becomes consistent with the experimental traces (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) is around the lower two panels of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, that is, an elongation fluctuation timescale with an upper limit of around 10-40\u00a0s. What this effectively means is that gene-wide fluctuations in the elongation rate may be present on a timescale of up to around 40\u00a0s without being apparent in experimental FRAP recovery curves. The exact timescale depends also on the magnitude of the fluctuations, taken here to be around 50% of the mean elongation rate, nevertheless, some degree of elongation fluctuation may contribute to the temporal variation of the transcription spot intensity."

For no fluctuations, no improvement is seen as expected, since a three-state model successfully describes the simulated data. For 13\u00a0s elongation fluctuations a small increase in complexity is observed. For the 43\u00a0s timescale, the magnitude of the improvement is comparable to that observed experimentally. This suggests these elongation fluctuations can potentially recapitulate the variability in spot intensities observed in experiments, with two important caveats. Firstly, in the simulations the 43\u00a0s timescale data plateau at 5 states, rather than around 7\u20138 for the experimental data. Secondly, training a three-state model on experimental data yielded distributions of polymerase initiations in each state with variances greater than expected for Poisson distributions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This super-Poissonian behaviour of the experimental data is not reproduced by training the same three state model on in silico elongation fluctuation data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating further complexity in the experimental data not fully explained by the simple elongation fluctuations."

Both TATA mutant lines displayed a slight reduction in overall spot intensity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), with FRAP experiments suggesting a similar dwell time to wild type (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Analysis of time-lapse experiments using the polymerase HMM framework found that the TATA mutants spend less time in medium and high initiation rate states, and more time at lower initiation rates, compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The overall timescale of initiation rate variability, measured through autocorrelation, was not substantially changed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) with both the wild-type and TATA mutations showing fluctuation timescales of several minutes. In addition, we observed no clear difference in switching rates between the inactive and active states. The rate of switching to the inactive state, <i>k(off)</i>, was unchanged between wild-type and TATA mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The tendency of spots to appear, <i>k(on)</i>, showed a slight impairment in A2C mutants, although this was not statistically significant. This subtle effect might be also interpreted as the enhanced occupancy of active states of unobservably low intensity in the A2C mutation, rather than simply the absence of transcription. We then addressed the likelihood of the gene switching up or down in initiation rate based upon its current state (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). For all cell lines, both wild-type and TATA mutant, high initiation rates had a tendency to revert to lower initiation rates, and lower initiation rates had a tendency to revert to higher initiation rates. In the TATA mutants, the initiation rate is less likely to switch to a higher activity state, resulting in reduced time spent in high activity states. Together these observations suggest that perturbing the TATA box does not affect the duration or frequency of active states, but rather modulates the initiation rates that are possible."

Implicit in the assumptions of the random telegraph (two state) model is the idea that cells undergoing a burst in a particular gene all have the same underlying initiation rate. However, it seems unlikely, based on our data, that the active initiation rate will be constant over time during a burst, or that it will be the same for all cells in a population. Rather, the rate of initiation will depend on the binding of molecular factors, which turn over on the timescale of seconds to tens of seconds, based upon measured residence times of transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Izeddin et al., 2014</a>). The cytoplasmic lifetime of mRNA means that these fast fluctuations are blurred out in static measurements, such as smFISH. In most such cases only broad differences in overall transcript content between cells can be determined, which accounts for the success of models with a few numbers of discrete states in fitting the data. Measurements using the MS2 system are integrated over the dwell time of the nascent RNA, a timescale of 2\u20133 min. The dynamic measurements can begin to resolve systematic variability in the initiation rate over time, which is difficult to assign to a small number of discrete states. Our proposed continuum model is summarized in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>. This model may also be approximated by a discrete state model with more states than can be effectively detected (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

In this view the initiation rate fluctuations can be thought of as the fraction of time for which the factors required for initiation are bound to the promoter. The rate of binding depends on the spatiotemporal variability in local concentrations, producing a continuum of activities when integrated over the MS2 RNA dwell time. When the TATA box is mutated, the overall decreased initiation rate in the active state may reflect the reduced rate of binding of necessary transcription factors, and therefore reduced occupancy of the initiating state (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Illustrating the potential equivalence of this rapid switching model with our continuum model, our data show that the optimal discrete 3-state model consigns polymerase initiations to non-Poissonian states (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), which implies either multiple initiation rates within a state (in other words more than 3 states) or switching between the discrete states faster than the imaging frame interval."

To answer this question, we simulated steady state levels of RNA derived from a gene where the binding rate varies continuously over time, overlaid with longer periods of inactivity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, upper). We incorporated autocorrelation-derived timescales and initiation rates extracted from the hidden Markov modelling together with a mRNA lifetime of 40 min, similar to measured lifetime values of <i>act5</i>-MS2 using actinomycinD-treated cells. The distribution of cytoplasmic mRNA molecules was well fit to a standard two-state bursting model (<a href=\"#bib47\">Singer et al., 2014</a>), using a negative binomial function (see appendix) capturing primarily the long timescale activity intervals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The shorter timescale of the MS2 measurements (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, lower) is able to discriminate fluctuations within active regions. In other words, when measured in the steady state, using methods such as RNA FISH, a continuum of transcriptional states will appear to consist of far fewer states than can be detected using live cell approaches, highlighting the different timescales measured by different methods. The two-state model approximates the magnitude and broad timescale of transcriptional variability, although it should be noted that the bursting parameters extracted may not directly correspond to the physical quantities of burst size and frequency."

When integrated over the retention time of nascent RNA at the transcription site, this \u2018microbursting\u2019 behaviour would give rise to a continuum of initiation rates. An alternative model might involve each cell having a distinct initiation rate in the active state, thereby producing a spectrum of initiation rates but with a simple two-state model for each cell (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sherman et al., 2015</a>). This model is equivalent to a limiting case of our continuum model with infinitesimally slow variation in the activation rate, however, for <i>act5</i> we observed timescales of variation of minutes by autocorrelation or Gibbs sampling of initiation rates. The differences between our continuum view and models with each cell having it\u2019s own stable transcription rate may reflect differences in experimental system. Alternatively, the differences may arise because live cell analysis of nascent RNA dynamics allows the timescales of fluctuation to be directly extracted from the data, which is not possible from measurements of protein abundance or steady state transcript counts."

To investigate the molecular origins of the bursting phenomenon, we constructed a simple theory of Poissonian transcription of the MS2 system. Unexpectedly, this simple system with constant promoter activity predicts exponential distributions of transcriptional pulses and intervals, with the pulse duration determined not only by the promoter initiation rate but also by the frame interval of observations and threshold of spot detection. We confirmed the predictions of the theory using Monte Carlo simulations of the MS2-tagged gene. In general, these simulations provide a framework for studying fluctuations in transcription site intensity, incorporating stochastic events for polymerase initiation, transition to elongation, elongation and termination/release. Additional complexity could be added in the form of the probability of promoter-proximal pausing, premature termination or interactions between adjacent polymerases. This approach allows us to predict the change in the spot intensity due to adding or changing a system parameter, and therefore determine whether competing models can be distinguished experimentally. This is illustrated by our analysis of the fluctuations in the elongation rate, where, in comparison with experimental data, we estimated an upper limit for the timescales of fluctuations at around 40 s. Analysis of elongation rate changes suggested such fluctuations could not account entirely for the complexity of the spectrum of transcriptional states, although they could potentially contribute."

Due to the current detection threshold of our system, a low level of basal transcription cannot be ruled out in this inactive state. Consistent with early views of bursting (<a href=\"#bib42\">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008</a>), the longer periods of inactivity may reflect slower dynamics of the remodelling of chromatin, rather than binding of specific transcriptional regulators, based upon our perturbation of the core promoter. Mutation of the <i>act5</i> TATA box reduced the overall amount of transcription, primarily by reducing the amount of time spent at high initiation rates rather than changing the switching dynamics between the off and active states. Importantly, neither TATA box mutation we studied abrogated transcription entirely, as might be expected if the pre-initiation complex can no longer bind the promoter. A reduction in the duration of periods of high activity might suggest an impaired duration or frequency of binding, or disruption of normal promoter conformational switches in response to binding (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gietl et al., 2014</a>). The strong effects of TATA mutations in yeast and plasmid systems (<a href=\"#bib37\">Patwardhan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Raser and O'Shea, 2004</a>) may reflect more simple promoter architectures.

The gene is strongly expressed and actin is usually put under the umbrella of 'housekeeping', which is a slight simplification as most of the <i>Dictyostelium</i> actin gene family, including <i>act5,</i> show some developmental regulation, at least at the transcript level (<a href=\"#bib35\">Muramoto et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Joseph et al., 2008</a>). A more strictly induced developmental gene might be expected to show more strict two state ON/OFF behaviour. However, even in cases with more prominent bursting we would argue that the initiation rate in the active state is likely to fluctuate over time and differ from cell to cell. This is supported by recent studies on mammalian transcriptional induction by serum and growth factors, which also suggest more complexity than a standard 2-state model provides, with evidence from luciferase reporter fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib30\">Molina et al., 2013</a>) and measurements of nascent RNA by smFISH indicating modulation of the transcription rate within the ON state\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib45\">Senecal et al., 2014</a>). A more recent smFISH study quantifying nascent RNA revealed modulation of burst size and frequency by cell size and cycle stage, respectively (<a href=\"#bib36\">Padovan-Merhar et al., 2015</a>). Whilst we have argued here for a more complex view of transcriptional regulation, it must be considered that the <i>act5</i> promoter is less than 700\u00a0bp long, the gene contains no introns and around 60% of the <i>Dictyostelium</i> genome encodes protein (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eichinger et al., 2005</a>), and so provides little scope for long range regulatory interactions. In the light of these features, we suggest the spectrum of states is likely to have considerably more scope for complexity in a mammalian cell. The continuum of states we infer is likely to be a more realistic view of gene activity fluctuations than the standard views of a small number of fixed discrete states. There are perhaps a hundred different proteins involved in a standard eukaryotic transcription reaction, even ignoring the components of the chromatin template. The likely configurational complexity, in addition to the potential for modulation by protein modification and nuclear context, seems consistent with the continuum view."

                                "text": "For targeting of MS2 repeats into the actin 5 gene, we utilized a BsrGI-SpeI restriction fragment containing 24 MS2 repeats (1.3\u00a0kb) upstream of the blasticidin resistance (bsr) cassette (<a href=\"#bib16\">Faix et al., 2004</a>). The resistance cassette is flanked by loxP sites for CRE-mediated removal of the marker, allowing transcription to terminate at the natural 3\u2019 sequence of the gene. For the 5\u2019 tagging of <i>act5</i>, the MS2-bsr was cloned between a promoter fragment of the gene (-680 to +21) and a gene fragment (+108 to +1313), using BsrGI and SpeI sites. Cells derived using this 5\u2019 tagging vector were used for all experiments described in this paper, unless indicated otherwise. For the gene replacement vector, the MS2-bsr was cloned between the same promoter fragment and a fragment from the 3\u2019 coding sequence and terminator of the gene (+1092 to +1899). For the 3\u2019 targeting vector, we used this same 3\u2019 region combined with a 5\u2019 region derived from the act5 coding sequence (+259 to +1113). The ATG corresponds to +1. The translational STOP, TAA is at +1129. The first clear polyadenylation motif (AATAAA) starts at +1193. Sequences were checked at each cloning step to ensure plasmid stocks retained the correct sequences (as specified by dictyBase). For TATA mutations, the T1A (AATAAAT) and A2C (TCTAAAT) mutant promoter fragments were generated by gene synthesis, then spliced into the wild-type promoter sequence using the BstEII site upstream of the TATA box, prior to inserting the MS2-bsr fusion, again using BsrGI and SpeI sites at the same positions."

These targeting fragments were transformed into a <i>Dictyostelium</i> AX3 clone previously engineered to express a red fluorescent nuclear marker, H2Bv3-Cherry, under the control of the endogenous promoter of the <i>rps30</i> gene. Targeted clones were identified by PCR, then genomic DNA Southern blotted to ensure MS2 repeat integrity and single correct insertions in the targeted clones. Correct targeting of TATA mutations to the <i>act5</i> promoter was checked by sequencing of PCR products from recombinant clones. Positive clones were then transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing the CRE recombinase, to remove the bsr cassette, allowing the MS2 RNA to fall under the control of the natural <i>act5</i> terminator. Clones were then transformed with an extrachromosomal vector, based on pDM1096 (from Dr. Douwe Veltman) expressing the MCP-GFP fusion protein, to permit detection of nascent RNA in living cells.

Imaging media was refreshed 1.5\u2009hr before imaging. Imaging was performed using an UltraView Vox spinning disc confocal microscope. Objective, laser lines, camera (Hamamatsu C9100-13 EM-CCD) settings, laser powers and exposure times were optimized to minimize photobleaching and ensure negligible photo-toxicity (measured in terms of the average transcription spot intensity - in trials we found transcription spots were attenuated before reduced cell motility or cell rounding is observed). Data were analysed using custom-built software integrating both cell tracking and spot detection.

Briefly, a cell with an active transcription site was identified and a single z-stack captured prior to bleaching. Bleaching parameters (bleach size, number of bleaching cycles, bleach power) were optimized empirically to give reliable bleaching, reproducible recovery and minimal photodamage. Two seconds after bleaching, z-stacks were acquired with a frame interval of 10\u00a0s for 5 min. The location of bleached spots is difficult to robustly measure automatically, therefore after automated segmentation and spot detection, spot locations were verified manually using a custom-built interface before spot intensity calculation. For each cell, the spot intensity and the relative local level of background fluorescence was recorded for every frame."

For dense fields of view a greedy algorithm, which assigns a cell to the closest cell in the previous frame, performs very poorly. Instead, we minimize the global sum of squared displacements from one frame to the next, adding penalties for unmatched cells in either frame. Because of the flux of cells entering and leaving the field of view, we reduce the unmatched cost as the coordinate approaches the edge of the field of view. This modification prevents a cell leaving the field of view being matched with a nearby cell entering in the next frame. The optimal configuration of frame-to-frame matches is found using the Munkres algorithm (<a href=\"#bib32\">Munkres, 1957</a>). To facilitate tracking of highly motile cells, where the frame-to-frame displacement can be comparable to the cell-cell separation, where necessary we include the mCherry and GFP fluorescence levels within the nucleus as additional coordinate dimensions. While differences in x- and y-coordinates are weighted quadratically, we use an alternative functional form for intensity differences, reflecting the increased measurement error for the fluorescence compared with the centroids. The function used has no cost for small differences in intensity, and becomes saturated at large intensity differences. This saturation value prevents a noisy intensity measurement, caused for example by poor segmentation, adversely influencing the matching."

To find matches which are robust and do not change in slightly sub-optimal configurations, we add an amount of randomness to each element of the cost matrix and recalculate the matches. This is repeated a large number of times, and only matches which appear in greater than a threshold fraction of configurations are recorded. Although this can lead to an increase in false negatives, trackable cells not being matched, it is an important step to ensure that false positives, incorrect matches giving rise to anomalous transcription dynamics, are minimized. Therefore, we set the confidence threshold to a large value such as 0.8 or 0.9; cell-frames which do not meet this level are flagged for efficient manual tracking using a custom designed user interface written in MATLAB (The Mathworks,\u00a0Natick,\u00a0MA)."

In the first stage, the promoter is modelled as switching across a \u2018ladder\u2019 of discrete initiation rate states, with single, exponentially-distributed steps for switches in the initiation rate. Typically, transitions are allowed only between adjacent or next-adjacent states. Using the generated switches in initiation rate, polymerase dynamics are simulated using single rate limiting steps for polymerase binding and single nucleotide elongation steps. Optionally, additional steps for the transition from transcription initiation to elongation, and for termination, poly-adenylation and RNA cleavage, can be included. The time for a cleaved RNA to leave the transcription site is typically in the timescale of seconds, and can be subsumed into the termination time. Polymerases that move within a specified \u2018blocking\u2019 distance of a downstream polymerase cannot make an elongation step until the downstream polymerase (in the 3\u2019 direction) has moved. Similarly, until a polymerase has moved more than the blocking distance from the binding site, the rate of an initiation event is set to zero."

For simulation of photobleaching experiments, the concentration and diffusivity of the fluorophores is included. When the bleaching event is triggered, each bound MCP is bleached with a probability depending on the laser strength. Bleaching of the background MCP level is modelled with a Gaussian depletion profile centred on the transcription site to allow the time evolution of the fraction of fluorescent MCP at the site to be calculated analytically as a Gaussian solution of the 3D diffusion equation. For this purpose, the nuclear boundary and the finite number of fluorophores in the cell are neglected."

The approach of Larson <i>et al</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Larson et al., 2011</a>) calculates the arrival time of each stem loop, and in doing so allows for stochasticity in the stepping time of the polymerase over each stem loop. Our simple model is applicable in the case where polymerases are sufficiently processive that the rate of loop production is approximately deterministic:"

To understand the change in spot intensity from one frame to the next, we considered the joint intensity distribution <i>P</i> (<i>I</i>(<i>t</i>)<i>, I</i>(<i>t + t<sub>frame</sub></i>)) (JID) as a correlated bivariate Gaussian distribution. The correlation is calculated from the autocorrelation theory in section 3.1.1 and depends on the time at which each loop is produced and the frame interval. From this simple approximation, one predicts that pulse durations will be exponentially distributed, since the JID is constant over time and does not depend on the history of the intensity, that is, for how long the spot has been present. For any exponential distribution (or geometric distribution for discrete frames), the characteristic timescale, <i>\u03bb</i> is determined by the probability of stopping."

Therefore an exponential pulse distribution does not imply bursty transcription but simply suggests that the probability of a spot disappearing between one frame and the next is constant and does not depend on how long the spot has been present. We found that for Poissonian transcription the exponential pulse length is produced by a balance between polymerase initiation and retention; in simple terms, a pulse ends if MCP-rich polymerases reaching the end of the gene and being cleaved are not replaced by newly transcribed MCP-bound stem loops. This exponential distribution is a feature of stochastic transcription initiation and therefore does not necessarily reflect switches in gene activity, with the pulse length depending strongly on the imaging protocol."

One approach to incorporate the history of the hidden state sequence is to add further hidden states encoding the promoter state in the previous <i>n</i> frames, as far back as required. For the so-called nth-order model, the hidden state configuration is {<i>g<sub>0,k</sub>,g<sub>\u22121,k</sub>,g<sub>\u22122,k</sub> \u2026</i>}, and the transition matrix is then modified so that <i>g<sub>0,k+1</sub></i> is sampled from <i>T<sub>ij</sub></i> using <i>g<sub>0,k</sub>,</i> and the higher order history states are deterministically passed from the previous frame: <i>g<sub>\u22121,k+1</sub> = g<sub>0,k</sub>, g<sub>\u22122,k+1</sub> = g<sub>\u22121,k</sub>, etc.</i>"

Briefly, cells were considered one at a time. For each cell, the hidden states are initialized at random by sampling the next state based on <i>P(next|prev, intensity)</i>. A time point is chosen at random, and the hidden state for this time point is resampled using the probability of each hidden state <i>P(H(k)|I(k),H(k-1),H(k+1))</i>, which takes account of the spot intensity, the transition from the previous frame and the transition to the next frame.

If the ground truth model has been identified then simulations of the model should fully reproduce the experimental data. Analysis of the hidden Markov fits for simple models with small numbers of discrete states indicates such models do not sufficiently account for the complexity of the data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In order to distinguish between competing models we looked into standard methods of balancing goodness of fit and model complexity. Those most widely used are the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Singer et al., 2014</a>) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which both penalize the number of free parameters in the model, albeit with different weights (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aho et al., 2014</a>). The AIC is a standard approach for finding the most accurate model when the real situation is likely to be highly complex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burnham and Anderson, 2002</a>). The BIC is most effective for simple systems and assumes the ground truth model is one of the candidate models to be tested. Since our data was more complex than any of the models we fit, the AIC was deemed the most appropriate for our study."

When the mRNA lifetime is a simple exponential distribution (one rate-limiting step for degradation) with lifetime <i>\u03c4<sub>RNA</sub></i>, the number of cytoplasmic mRNAs is a well-characterized Poisson distribution. The effect of transcriptional bursting is to broaden the distribution of cytoplasmic mRNA number, increasing the ratio of the variance to the mean. In this situation, the distribution of mRNA per cell, <i>x</i>, has been shown to be characterized by a negative binomial (NB) distribution (<a href=\"#bib38\">Paulsson et al., 2000</a>)."

Concerning general conclusions about the prevalence of burstiness: I would be cautious here since this is a highly active housekeeping gene, and it is known that some constitutive genes behave in a non-bursty manner; also to me this is almost semantic, since the difference between getting from very low initiation rate to high initiation rate (no bursting) or from null initiation rate to high initiation rate (bursting) is to my opinion not deeply significant. I fully agree with you concerning the writing, the text needs thorough reformulation to drastically improve its clarity, especially the take home messages should be stated in a more down-to-earth manner to give some meat to non-specialists, and interesting findings such as the time scales of changes in initiation rates should be better discussed.\""

The same group (Corrigan et al., Current Biology 2014) and others (Molina et al., PNAS 2014) has shown that transcription rates of on-activity windows can vary significantly over time for genes responding to extracellular signalling. Since the fact that a gene can exhibit different rates of transcription within its periods of activity was shown before, the novelty of this work lies mainly in the extension of these findings to demonstrate that varying transcription rates i) can occur in a \"steady state\" situation and ii) arise mainly from variations in the transcription initiation rates.</i> "

The Molina paper finds different parameters in response to different added signals, calculating production rates for populations of cells exposed to distinct stimuli. It is very interesting, but here we directly quantify transcriptional dynamics rather than infer them from protein. Our work examines the heterogeneous spectrum of single cell behaviours within a population, and finds that cells do not have fixed bursting parameters. We have added a sentence on the steady state nature of the experiment."

Although it seems reasonable that such fundamental processes will hold true for a number of genes, the data presented here offers limited insights on the molecular mechanisms at their origin or on their potential biological consequences. Having several genes to assess the variability in the magnitude of these initiation rate fluctuations, as well as the time scales allowing to switch from one state to another would be of major interest and shed light on the biological significance of these findings.</i> "
