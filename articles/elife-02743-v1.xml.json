Despite its essential role in orchestrating responses to animal cues, basic principles of information processing by the vomeronasal system are still unknown. The medial amygdala (MeA) occupies a central position in the vomeronasal pathway, upstream of hypothalamic centers dedicated to defensive and social responses. We have characterized sensory responses in the mouse MeA and uncovered emergent properties that shed new light onto the transformation of vomeronasal information into sex- and species-specific responses. In particular, we show that the MeA displays a degree of stimulus selectivity and a striking sexually dimorphic sensory representation that are not observed in the upstream relay of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the development of sexually dimorphic circuits in the MeA requires steroid signaling near the time of puberty to organize the functional representation of sensory stimuli."

Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the development of sexually dimorphic circuits in the MeA requires steroid signaling near the time of puberty to organize the functional representation of sensory stimuli."

Impairment in either vomeronasal or olfactory signaling results in dramatic deficits in predator avoidance and social communication (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bean and Wysocki, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Stowers et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Mandiyan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Yoon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kimchi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Kobayakawa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Isogai et al., 2011</a>), demonstrating that chemical cues are essential mediators of animal\u2013animal recognition in mice and that the main olfactory system and the vomeronasal pathway work in concert to guide behavioral responses to chemosensory input (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dulac and Wagner, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dulac and Kimchi 2008</a>). The main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and vomeronasal organ (VNO) are distinguished by the types of chemical cues that each detects: volatile compounds are primarily detected by the MOE while non-volatile signals are preferentially processed by the VNO. At the circuit level, neurons in the MOE project to the main olfactory bulb (MOB), which in turn projects axons to the lateral amygdala, primary olfactory cortex, and ultimately to areas involved in the cognitive processing of odorants (<a href=\"#bib88\">Sosulski et al., 2011</a>). In addition, neurons expressing the neuropeptide GnRH, a master regulator of reproduction in vertebrates, receive major inputs from primary olfactory areas (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boehm et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Yoon et al., 2005</a>). In contrast, vomeronasal circuits largely bypass cognitive centers, as sensory neurons of the VNO send axons to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), which in turn projects to nuclei of the medial amygdala (MeA), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib74\">Petrovich et al., 2001</a>), areas involved in controlling innate behaviors and neuroendocrine changes."

The identification of key components of VNO signal transduction, such as the TRPC2 ion channel (<a href=\"#bib55\">Liman et al., 1999</a>), and the members of the V1R and V2R families of vomeronasal receptors (VRs) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dulac and Axel, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Herrada and Dulac, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Matsunami and Buck, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Ryba and Tirindelli, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dulac and Torello, 2003</a>), has established the molecular foundation of vomeronasal sensing. In vitro recording and imaging of VNO neuronal activity after exposure to various stimuli, as well as in vivo characterization of the vomeronasal receptor response profile to a wide range of animal cues, have revealed that distinct populations of VNO receptors identify ethologically relevant chemosignals with high specificity and that signal detection in the VNO plays an essential role in distinguishing behaviorally relevant sensory information (<a href=\"#bib37\">Holy et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Nodari et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Haga et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Isogai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Turaga and Holy, 2012</a>)."

This prompted us to investigate the respective contributions of MOE and VNO stimulations to MeA responses. MOE stimulation elicited clear olfactory-evoked neuronal activity in the MOB and the posterolateral cortical amygdala (PLCO) in response to volatile urinary cues and odorants (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). However, while we observed robust VNO-mediated responses in the MeA, we did not detect stimulus-specific responses for MOE-delivered stimuli (units responsive to MOE stimuli at p\u22640.01: 1.1%, 95% CI: 0.8\u20131.6%; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Rather, in agreement with <a href=\"#bib84\">Samuelsen and Meredith (2009)</a> and <a href=\"#bib65\">Miyamichi et al.

Therefore, functional and anatomical evidence confirms that the MeA, as targeted in these experiments, receives input predominantly from the AOB (<a href=\"#bib77\">Pro-sistiaga et al., 2007</a>).

The vertices represent exclusive responses to one of the stimuli. Comparison of the spatial distribution of individual neurons between the AOB and the MeA indicates that, whereas AOB units tend to populate the central region of the triangular plot, MeA units more evenly span the entire area with an increased density at the vertices. Dividing the triangular response space into four equal quadrants (dashed lines <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>) showed that 44.4% of AOB units vs 21.6% of MeA units reside in the central quadrant associated with less specific responses. Thus, flow of information from the AOB to the MeA is associated with a sharpening of stimulus-driven responses. The increased selectivity of sensory responses in the MeA is similarly reflected by a marked decorrelation of responses evoked by different sensory stimuli across the MeA population (AOB: <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> inset; MeA: <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> inset; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We measured responses in male mice to stimuli from three ethologically defined classes: female (estrus: BALB/c, CBA, and C57), male (BALB/c, CBA, and C57), and defensive cues (fox, bobcat, and rat urine). A principal component analysis performed on responses evoked by these stimuli revealed that the first PC reflected the distinction between \u2018female\u2019 and \u2018predator\u2019 categories and accounted for 41% of the total response variance (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The second PC distinguished between \u2018female\u2019 vs \u2018male\u2019 stimuli and accounted for 19% of the total variance. Therefore, most of the variation of sensory responses in the MeA of male mice is devoted to the distinction between \u2018female\u2019 from \u2018predator\u2019 and 'male' categories respectively. However, individual sensory responses in the MeA rarely form sharply defined stimulus categories, but rather, maintain enough information to distinguish between individual elements of each category (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We quantified the sex preference of individual neurons using an index that ranges from \u22121 to 1, reflecting responses exclusive to male or female stimuli, respectively. Distributions of responses from both male and female MeA neurons appear strikingly skewed away from zero, toward stimuli representing the opposite sex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; p&lt;0.0001 permutation test). Indeed, 82.7% of male MeA units respond more strongly to female stimuli and 83.3% of female MeA units respond stronger to male stimuli.

This developmental schema, known as the organizational/activational hypothesis of sexual dimorphism in the brain (<a href=\"#bib75\">Phoenix et al., 1959</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">McCarthy, 2008</a>), proposes the establishment of sex-specific circuit features during a perinatal \u2018organizational\u2019 stage that are subsequently made functional during a peripubertal \u2018activational\u2019 stage. To understand when the MeA circuitry acquires its sex-specific functional features, we recorded responses to sensory stimuli in the MeA of juvenile male and female mice at 18\u201321 days, which is roughly 1 week prior to puberty onset (28 days; <a href=\"#bib68\">Nathan et al., 2006</a>). We found that, while single units recorded from the MeA of juvenile mice responded to VNO stimuli, they were far less selective for male, female, and predator cues (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,F</a>) than those in the adult MeA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,E</a>), and instead showed closer similarity with the response selectivity identified in the adult AOB (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Thus, 34.7% of juvenile units were in the central quadrant associated with less specific responses, as opposed to 21.6% in the adult MeA. The selectivity of MeA responses to opposite sex cues is absent in juvenile animals, and was not significantly different between males and females (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>; p=0.06, permutation test), a feature also shared with the adult AOB and strikingly different from the adult MeA. Thus, MeA responses in juvenile mice are not sexually dimorphic, even though the perinatal organizational phase of MeA sexual development, during which steroid-dependent cell death generates sexually dimorphic MeA cell numbers, is essentially complete (<a href=\"#bib94\">Wu et al., 2009</a>), and appear instead highly reminiscent to the responses observed in the AOB."

We therefore reasoned that the sexually dimorphic functional differences observed here may be impaired in mice lacking aromatase function, and investigated sensory responses in the MeA of adult aromatase knockout mice (ArKO<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fisher et al., 1998</a>). As predicted, MeA units from ArKO<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> males frequently responded to multiple stimuli; whereas, MeA units from age matched heterozygous littermates (ArKO<sup>+/\u2212</sup>) were similar to those observed in wild-type males (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Indeed, the sex specificity of neurons recorded in adult ArKO<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> males is largely symmetric around 0, and presents a pattern of responses intermediate to those observed in intact juvenile and adult male mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In contrast, adult heterozygous littermates (ArKO<sup>+/\u2212</sup>) displayed a bias towards responses to female stimuli similar to that observed in wild-type males (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Like juvenile animals, most (42.1%) of MeA units recorded from adult ArKO<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> males reside in the central quadrant associated with less specific responses, compared to 19.5% of units recorded from ArKO<sup>+/\u2212</sup>. Similarly, response patterns to different stimuli are much more correlated in the MeA of ArKO<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> males (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, bottom) than in ArKO<sup>+/\u2212</sup> littermates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, top) or wild-type males (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), reflecting a loss of discriminability at the individual unit level. These results suggest that estrogen signaling (via conversion of testosterone by aromatase) is essential for generating the pattern of sensory responses observed in the adult male MeA. The fact that adult ArKO<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> males are also different from juvenile males indicates that other processes, such as direct testosterone signaling, may play an important role in developing the adult MeA sensory representation."

While some AOB units display clear selectivity for distinct VNO stimuli, AOB units typically respond to multiple sensory stimuli, and many AOB units respond to multiple stimuli associated with conflicting behavioral outcomes such as female conspecifics and predators (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ben-Shaul et al., 2010</a>). Nearly all AOB output neurons project to the MeA, however, the convergence of input in the MeA lead to a different pattern of sensory responses, such that the fraction of MeA neurons responding to any given stimulus is smaller, and the specificity of MeA responses elicited by sensory stimuli is greater than observed in the AOB."

Similarly, we find that the fraction of neurons activated by any given stimulus is approximately threefold greater in the AOB compared to the MeA. While the function of unresponsive units remains unclear, a reasonable suggestion is that these units respond to stimuli that were not presented in these experiments.

The greater MeA selectivity may result from the preferential contribution of the most selective AOB units to MeA responses, or from the transformation of AOB inputs by sensory processing within the MeA. The apparent functional disambiguation of AOB inputs by MeA units suggests a logic and specificity in AOB to MeA connectivity that strongly contrasts with the distributive pattern of projection reported from the MOB to the piriform cortex (<a href=\"#bib88\">Sosulski et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">Choi et al., 2005</a>)."

These findings demonstrate the essential contribution of the vomeronasal system to the control of social behaviors, and show that effector circuits for behaviors of both sexes exist in the brain, and are activated or repressed by vomeronasal activity in a sex-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kimchi et al., 2007</a>). The transformation of the vomeronasal sensory representation in the MeA precisely fulfills the characteristics required of such a behavioral switch. Unlike the AOB, in which sensory responses are similar in males and females, over 80% of the recorded MeA neurons respond preferentially to stimuli from the opposite sex. Accordingly, an entire category of \u2018same-sex\u2019 responses is decimated in the MeA representation. Same-sex information is not entirely lost: indeed, the lack of male to male aggression in TRPC2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice demonstrates that the representation of male stimuli, in male mice, is present in wild-type animals, depends on vomeronasal signaling, and is capable of driving robust behaviors (<a href=\"#bib89\">Stowers et al., 2002</a>). Same sex-information may therefore either rely on the minimal representation found in the MeA, or be processed preferentially by other secondary vomeronasal relays."

It is generally believed that testosterone accounts for most, if not all, of development of the known sexually dimorphic structures in the mammalian brain (<a href=\"#bib66\">Morris et al., 2004</a>). The manner by which testosterone shapes the nervous system, however, depends on the specific neural circuit, such that cell death, synapse formation, synapse elimination, neurogenesis, and changes to neuron morphology all play important roles (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cooke et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ibanez et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Morris et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Forger &amp; de Vries, 2010</a>). The influence of sex-steroids on the brain is strictly controlled according to the developmental stage, with two phases described as critical. During an initial phase, which occurs near birth, neural structures are thought to be differentially \u2018organized\u2019 by exposure to testosterone in males, but not in females (<a href=\"#bib75\">Phoenix et al., 1959</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">McCarthy, 2008</a>). This initial phase is thought to create clear structural and anatomical differences within sexually dimorphic regions. During a second phase, which occurs during puberty, sexually dimorphic circuits are \u2018activated\u2019 such that they begin functioning as mature circuits capable of effecting sexually dimorphic behaviors (<a href=\"#bib75\">Phoenix et al., 1959</a>)."

Our recordings from the MeA of mice in the week prior to puberty onset demonstrate that MeA units had not developed the sexually dimorphic response patterns characteristic of adult animals, although these recordings were performed after sex-specific cell death is largely complete (<a href=\"#bib94\">Wu et al., 2009</a>; see ; <a href=\"#bib24\">Forger and de Vries, 2010</a>). Therefore, the organizational phase of steroid-dependent MeA cell death likely provides a template for future sexually dimorphic sensory responses, but is not in itself sufficient to endow the MeA with adult function that might, for example, require further elimination of neurons with the wrong sex cue specificity. Importantly, juvenile MeA neurons are not silent but rather respond vigorously to vomeronasal stimuli in a manner very similar to AOB neurons in adult animals, demonstrating that the MeA is already an actively functioning circuit."

Our recordings from animals with manipulated hormone levels and hormone signaling show that sexually dimorphic patterns of MeA function in adult mice are estrogen dependent. Previous experiments studying an independently made ArKO mouse line reported significant impairment in social recognition (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bakker et al., 2002</a>), which may result from the failure of MeA neurons in ArKO animals to maturate adult patterns of MeA responses. In some species of mammals, the influence of sex-steroids on MeA anatomy persists well into adulthood (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cooke et al., 1999</a>) supporting our conclusion that additional hormone-dependent circuit changes occur after the perinatal organizational phase. Moreover, a multi-stage organizational model of sex-specific behavioral circuits is supported by elegant experiments in hamsters demonstrating profound rearrangements of circuits underlying social behaviors during puberty (<a href=\"#bib97\">Zehr et al., 2006</a>)."

Death of MeA neurons during development is important for sculpting a sexually dimorphic circuit. However, we now know that the functional properties of MeA units can be similar even though the number of cells in the male vs female MeA is different. Therefore, other processes that build on these early differences must exist, and different mechanisms for achieving proper functional sexual dimorphism in the MeA can be proposed, each providing unique and testable predictions on how neural circuits in the adult MeA develop. Synaptic input from the AOB to the MeA may be sculpted in adult mice to disproportionately favor AOB input carrying opposite sex information to the MeA. Alternatively, or in addition to, maturation of inhibition within the MeA at puberty may act to silence, or specifically shunt less robust MeA responses. This latter mechanism could act in a manner similar to the control of critical period plasticity within the cortex through a time- and steroid-dependent maturation of inhibitory connectivity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hensch, 2005</a>)."

Rather, specific circuit mechanisms yet to be uncovered must act together to allow features of vomeronasal information to be extracted from the overall AOB representation based on intrinsic MeA properties, as well as, the sex, age, and physiological status of the individual animal. Remarkably, the differences in MeA activity observed in males vs females, juveniles vs adults, or mutants vs wild-type animals correlate tightly with distinct patterns of social behaviors from each of these groups. This suggests that the age- and sex-specific transformations in MeA sensory processing uncovered by our study are likely to underlie fundamental changes in social behavior throughout development."

A tracheal incision was made using fine scissors and a 15-mm length polyethylene tube (I.D. 0.76 mm, O.D. 1.22 mm, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was inserted in the caudal end of the cut trachea and held in place with Vetbond glue (3 M, St. Paul, MN). This tracheotomy was subsequently used to maintain anesthesia (0.5\u20132% isoflurane in pure oxygen) for the duration of the electrophysiological experiments. The rostral end of the trachea was sealed closed to prevent efflux of fluid from the cervical cavity to the nasal cavity and the VNO, or incubated and used to control airflow across the MOE. The sympathetic nerve trunk was gently isolated from connective tissue and enclosed with a stimulating cuff electrode using the carotid artery for structural support. All incisions were then closed with Vetbond, and the mouse was placed in a custom built stereotaxic apparatus. To allow for cleaning the nasal cavity and the VNO between different stimulus presentations (see below), a plastic tube was inserted below the mouth to allow suction of fluid through the nasopalatine duct. Fluid flow was regulated with a computer controlled solenoid valve (Takasago, Japan) connected to a vacuum line. Surgical silk sutures (6/0, CP Medical, Portland, OR) were inserted into the cheek skin to gently pull them laterally to prevent occlusion of the naso-palatine duct during suction."

This post-stimulus window ensured inclusion of responses occurring prior to and after electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerve. Response magnitude was quantified as the change in average firing rate during the 40 s following stimulus presentation relative to the firing rate during the 20 s prior to stimulus presentation. Spike rates for histograms were binned into 2 s epochs, and then averaged across repeated stimulus presentations. Unless otherwise noted, statistics comparing two populations of units (e.g.: responses from male vs female animals) were performed using a nonparametric permutation test (<a href=\"#bib20\">Efron and Tibshirani, 1993</a>) as observed distributions were not typically normally distributed."

Next, the physical distance between the recording sites for each pair of units (between the two categories) was calculated. For <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, positive distances indicate that the conspecific unit was dorsal to the predator unit.

The predator/conspecific contrast ratio values were then subtracted for each predator vs conspecific unit comparison, in a manner identical to the distance analysis described above, to determine if there was a correlation between the location of a unit and the specificity of response tuning (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

Prior to insertion into the brain, a retaining current of \u22122 \u03bcA was applied and the outer surface of the glass electrode was thoroughly washed, to minimize unintentional labeling along the electrode path dorsal to the injection site. At the injection site (1.80 mm lateral, 1.8 mm posterior, and 5.5 mm ventral from Bregma) the polarity of current was switched and +5 \u03bcA, constant current was applied for 10 min. Following each injection, a \u22122 \u03bcA retaining current was reapplied for 10 min prior to and during the retraction of the electrode. The scalp was then sutured and a small amount of Vetbond was applied to close the wound.

This manuscript describes an elegant set of experiments investigating the response properties of individual MeA neurons to non-volatile odorant cues from predator and male and female rodent urine. They find that 1) neurons in the MeA have heightened stimulus specificity as compared with neurons in the accessory olfactory bulb, the upstream region; 2) sexually dimorphic responses that require intact estrogen signaling in the prenatal mouse brain. This is an important piece of work that should be of interest to a broad audience."

There is a discussion of principal component analysis and a supplemental figure which shows that cells responsive to a female (male or predator) stimulus are generally sensitive to an independent stimulus from the same class, but the correlation appears to hover at less than 50% for male/female odors and lower for predator. Moreover, the diagram in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2</a> seems a bit misleading, as bobcat appears closer to Male BalbC and Male C57, yet is drawn with a line connecting it, arbitrarily it seems, to rat and fox.

A general feature of sensory systems is that neurons located at later stages of sensory processing are less active than those at earlier stages.

Similarly, we find that the fraction of neurons activated by any given stimulus is approximately 3 fold greater in the AOB compared to the MeA. While the function of unresponsive units remains unclear, a reasonable suggestion is that these units respond to stimuli that were not presented in these experiments. Alternatively, vomeronasal induced behaviors are strongly influenced by behavioral state (for example: dominant versus subordinate, estrus versus non-estrus, or adult versus juvenile), and it is possible that only a subset of MeA neurons are active in any given behavioral or physiological state."

First, the pre-stimulus firing rate was subtracted from the post-stimulus firing rate of each unit in order to account for differences in baseline firing rates. The absolute value of the baseline subtracted response was then taken to account for responses that consisted of a reduction in activity as compared to the pre-stimulus epoch. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2A</a>, such cases are an extreme minority in our data as units typically were inactive before a stimulus was presented and respond to stimuli with an increase in activity.

This would be important to confirm that any one response is due to chemosignals from one of the three categories. There is a discussion of principal component analysis and a supplemental figure which shows that cells responsive to a female (male or predator) stimulus are generally sensitive to an independent stimulus from the same class, but the correlation appears to hover at less than 50% for male/female odors and lower for predator. Moreover, the diagram in</i> <a href=\"#fig3s2\"><i>Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2</i></a><i>seems a bit misleading, as bobcat appears closer to Male BalbC and Male C57, yet is drawn with a line connecting it, arbitrarily it seems, to rat and fox.
