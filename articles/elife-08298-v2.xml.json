The mechanisms underlying these perceptual shifts are critical to our understanding of how neural circuits support animal cognition and behavior. Starved flies exhibit enhanced sensitivity to attractive odors and reduced sensitivity to aversive odors. Here, we show that a functional remodeling of the olfactory map is mediated by two parallel neuromodulatory systems that act in opposing directions on olfactory attraction and aversion at the level of the first synapse. Short neuropeptide F sensitizes an antennal lobe glomerulus wired for attraction, while tachykinin (DTK) suppresses activity of a glomerulus wired for aversion. Thus we show parallel neuromodulatory systems functionally reconfigure early olfactory processing to optimize detection of nutrients at the risk of ignoring potentially toxic food resources."

The mechanisms underlying these perceptual shifts are critical to our understanding of how neural circuits support animal cognition and behavior. Starved flies exhibit enhanced sensitivity to attractive odors and reduced sensitivity to aversive odors. Here, we show that a functional remodeling of the olfactory map is mediated by two parallel neuromodulatory systems that act in opposing directions on olfactory attraction and aversion at the level of the first synapse. Short neuropeptide F sensitizes an antennal lobe glomerulus wired for attraction, while tachykinin (DTK) suppresses activity of a glomerulus wired for aversion. Thus we show parallel neuromodulatory systems functionally reconfigure early olfactory processing to optimize detection of nutrients at the risk of ignoring potentially toxic food resources."

This behavior is due to two neuropeptides (molecules that carry signals between neurons) that have opposite effects on different parts of the fly's nervous system. One of the neuropeptides made the groups of neurons that respond to attractive odors more responsive, while the other suppressed the activity of neurons that normally respond to unpleasant odors. Together these changes could encourage the animals to take more risks when they are hungry, by suppressing of their ability to recognize noxious or harmful chemicals in favor of their ability to perceive attractive odors."

Thus, individual neurons may read the same metabolic signals and then respond in different ways to fine-tune the activity of nearby circuits of neurons to alter foraging behavior in a coordinated manner. Furthermore, it is almost certain that similar changes to the sensory system could affect an animal's appetite for food. One of the next challenges will be to attempt to understand if and how appetite in humans might be controlled in a similar way."

The study of hunger and satiety in fruit flies has identified key neuromodulators that serve to communicate an animal's nutritional status to its nervous system and thus, change its behavior. Neuromodulators such as dopamine, short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and NPF have been demonstrated to influence different aspects of appetitive behaviors such as taste sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Inagaki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Marella et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Inagaki et al., 2014</a>), the formation and expression of appetitive memories (<a href=\"#bib30\">Krashes et al., 2009</a>), odor preference (<a href=\"#bib48\">Root et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Beshel and Zhong, 2013</a>), and control of food intake (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wang et al., 2013</a>)."

For example, food deprivation increases an animal's tolerance for noxious stimuli (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gillette et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Inagaki et al., 2014</a>) and suppresses escape behavior at the risk of predation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gillette et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gaudry and Kristan, 2009</a>). Thus, when evaluating potential food sources, animals must weigh both aversive and attractive sensory inputs. Their perceptions of these sensory stimuli and behavioral decisions are influenced by their own internal states and needs for energy homeostasis. In <i>Drosophila</i>, starvation heightens sensitivity in odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) that are critical for behavioral attraction to appetitive odors through neuromodulatory mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib48\">Root et al., 2011</a>). Starvation has also been shown to reduce behavioral avoidance to innately aversive odors (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bracker et al., 2013</a>). This starvation effect requires the presence of appetitive odors and has been suggested to occur at higher order levels of the <i>Drosophila</i> brain (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bracker et al., 2013</a>). Whether starvation also reduces sensitivity of ORNs in the periphery that are critical for behavioral avoidance is unknown."

This pathway operates in parallel and independently of the mechanisms driving increases in attractive odor sensitivity. We show here that starvation does not simply scale up or down global activity in the antennal lobe. Rather, it upregulates activity in certain sensory channels and downregulates it in others in what appears to be an optimization strategy that may serve to increase the hedonic value of food odors. Thus, individual neurons may read the same global metabolic signals and differentially respond in a manner that fine tunes local circuits towards a concerted modulation of appetitive behaviors."

The hedonic value of behaviorally relevant odors is therefore encoded by glomerular activity in the early olfactory system. In particular, activation of the DM1 glomerulus, innervated by Or42b ORNs, triggers attraction to an odor, while activation of DM5, innervated by Or85a ORNs, reduces attraction to high concentrations of vinegar (<a href=\"#bib51\">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</a>). Thus, activity in DM1 and DM5 represents positive and negative valence, respectively, and physiological modulation of these glomeruli should alter olfactory behaviors."

To what extent does sNPF signaling account for behavioral attraction at all odor concentrations? To answer this question, we used RNAi to knock down expression of the sNPF receptor (sNPFR) in ORNs using <i>Orco-Gal4</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Larsson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Vosshall and Hansson, 2011</a>). At low concentrations (0.5\u20131%) of cider vinegar, knockdown of sNPFR eliminated the behavioral difference between starved and fed flies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, at high concentrations (5\u201325%), the appetitive index of sNPFR knockdown flies remains significantly higher than that of the control fed flies. In a fed state, sNPFR knockdown had no behavioral effect compared to the control flies (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These results suggest the existence of a parallel mechanism for starvation-mediated changes in appetitive behavior at high odor concentrations."

Most neuromodulators signal through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Greengard, 2001</a>) and a small increase in GPCR expression can have a dramatic effect on neural circuit function and related behavior (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bendesky et al., 2011</a>). We therefore performed a transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq to identify differentially expressed GPCRs in the antennae of fed and starved flies. We focused on the typical GPCR families (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brody and Cravchik, 2000</a>) that include receptors for biogenic amines, neuropeptides, as well as classic neurotransmitters, because these types of GPCRs have the potential to alter excitability (<a href=\"#bib21\">Greengard, 2001</a>)."

Other upregulated GPCRs, not yet described in ORNs, include the dopamine 2-like and dopamine-ecdysone receptors which have both been implicated in enhancing fly sugar receptor sensitivity in the starved state (<a href=\"#bib26\">Inagaki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Marella et al., 2012</a>). Additional GPCRs shown to influence feeding behaviors include the serotonin 2A receptor (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gasque et al., 2013</a>), a receptor that promotes anorectic behaviors and the GABA-B receptor type 1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bjordal et al., 2014</a>), a receptor that is part of a circuit that detects amino acid imbalances. Whether these receptors are expressed in select glomeruli remains to be determined. Interestingly, dopaminergic (<a href=\"#bib46\">Riemensperger et al., 2005</a>) and serotonergic (<a href=\"#bib50\">Roy et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dacks et al., 2009</a>) terminals have been described in the adult antennal lobe, thus making these receptor classes highly plausible targets for internal state modulation."

One example is as the adipokinetic hormone receptor, which regulates lipid and carbohydrate storage (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bharucha et al., 2008</a>). Another is the pyrokinin 1 receptor, which is activated by hugin, a neuropeptide that suppresses feeding (<a href=\"#bib40\">Melcher and Pankratz, 2005</a>). Although it is not known whether these two antennal GPCRs are expressed in ORNs, such localization has been reported for the <i>Drosophila</i> tachykinin receptor (DTKR). This receptor, also known as Takr99D, mediates presynaptic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib68\">Ignell et al., 2009</a>) and is implicated in nutritional stress responses (<a href=\"#bib63\">Winther and Nassel, 2001</a>).

Starved DTKR knockdown flies do not behave differently from control starved flies in response to low concentrations (0.5\u20131%) of cider vinegar. In contrast, their appetitive index at high concentrations (5\u201325%) of cider vinegar is significantly lower than that of control flies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Furthermore, we found no effect of DTKR knockdown on the behavior of fed flies (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, DTKR signaling is necessary for starvation-dependent change in food search behavior at high, but not low odor concentrations."

To address this question, we explored whether removal of both signaling mechanisms transforms the behavior of starved flies into that of fed flies. Indeed, simultaneous knockdown of the sNPF peptide (the equivalent of sNFPR knockdown, see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and DTKR in Orco neurons abolished the effect of starvation, leading to behavior indistinguishable from that of fed flies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

We used two-photon microscopy to monitor odor-evoked activity in the second order projection neurons (PNs) that receive input from ORNs (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2003</a>). Flies bearing <i>GH146-LexA</i> and <i>LexAop-GCaMP</i> transgenes allow the imaging of PN dendritic calcium responses in specific glomeruli to cider vinegar (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Given that the PN response in DM1 to low odor concentrations is sensitized by starvation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Root et al., 2011</a>), we compared the response to higher odor concentrations in fed and starved flies. Strikingly, starvation suppresses olfactory sensitivity of DM5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) a glomerulus that mediates aversion (<a href=\"#bib51\">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</a>). Furthermore, DM5 is the only glomerulus recruited by vinegar that is modulated by starvation at high odor intensity (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a> for a more complete characterization of glomerular responses to vinegar in fed and starved flies). Testing a range of concentrations, we found that DM5 became activated at 20% saturated vapor (SV pressure) in fed flies, but not until 80% SV in starved flies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). At the concentrations when DM5 is suppressed by starvation, DM1 responses saturate and do not exhibit further modulation by starvation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Thus, modulation of DM5 olfactory sensitivity by starvation increases the activation threshold of a glomerulus that mediates aversion."

Consistent with our hypothesis, knockdown of DTKR in ORNs abolished the starvation-dependent suppression in DM5 across a range of odor concentrations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). DM1 responses to 80% SV vinegar, however, remained unaffected. The lack of an effect of DTKR on DM1 responses may reflect a saturation of these responses at this odor concentration that would mask further increase in response amplitude upon reduction of DTKR levels (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Furthermore, starvation-dependent sensitization in DM1 was abolished by knockdown of sNPFR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib48\">Root et al., 2011</a>). Although two other glomeruli (VM2 and DM2) also exhibited changes in activity at a high odor concentration when DTKR signaling is removed (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), it is known that these two glomeruli do not contribute to appetitive behavior (<a href=\"#bib51\">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</a>). We next asked whether the starvation modulation of DM5 generalizes to other odors, and found that the response of DM5 PNs to ethyl butyrate is similarly modulated by DTKR (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>)."

We investigated whether these LNs are the source of DTK for DM5 modulation, by knocking down DTK expression in LNs with RNAi. We first monitored odor-evoked activity in flies that express GCaMP in PNs and DTK-RNAi in LNs or ORNs as a negative control.

The data suggest that sNPF and DTK receptors are preferentially upregulated by starvation in select glomeruli, such as DM1 and DM5. We therefore investigated whether DTK and sNPFRs coexist in the same ORN population, or whether each receptor selectively exerts greater effect on specific glomeruli. To test this, we first investigated the effect of exogenous application of either peptide on the activity of DM1 and DM5. We performed electrical stimulation of the olfactory nerve while measuring calcium activity in PNs before and after addition of synthetic sNPF or DTK. We found that exogenous sNPF increased the response of DM1 but not DM5 in starved flies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Conversely, exogenous DTK suppressed activity in DM5 but not DM1 in starved flies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In a previous report, we observed modulation of DM1 when DTKR levels were knocked down in most ORNs (<a href=\"#bib68\">Ignell et al., 2009</a>). Thus our current observation that DTK peptide administration doesn't decrease responses in DM1 may be due to saturation of DTKR already present in Or42b by endogenous levels of the peptide; whereas upregulation of DTKR in Or85a may explain its enhanced response to the DTKR peptide in this population. It is noteworthy that other glomeruli such as DM2 and VM2 exhibit some DTK sensitivity even in the satiated state, as observed in the current and previous study (<a href=\"#bib68\">Ignell et al., 2009</a>). Thus, DM1 and DM5 appear to be specifically sensitive to the addition of sNPF and DTK, respectively, in both a glomerular-specific and starvation-dependent manner."

Thus, reducing sNPFR dependent modulation of Or42b activity blocks the effects of starvation in enhancing both neuronal sensitivity and behavioral attraction. According to our working model, behavioral attraction at higher odor concentrations of vinegar is the sum of the opposing effects of Or42b and Or85a. We propose that removing the sNPFR modulation of Or42b does not reduce behavioral attraction to fed levels because the weight of Or42b increases when Or85a is inhibited. This working model is supported by our observation that net behavioral attraction is not completely abolished by genetic knockdown of sNPFR. Knocking down DTKR had no effect in the same neurons for which we observed phenotypes with sNPFR-RNAi. Although DTKR could in theory be absent from this population, we prefer the hypothesis Or42b responses are saturated by the 5% vinegar that we used for these behavioral experiments."

In particular, sensitization of DM1 in fed flies should mimic the effect of starvation, while sensitization of DM5 in starved flies should mimic the effect of satiety. To test this hypothesis, we ectopically expressed the bacterially derived sodium channel (NaChBac), which makes neurons hyperexcitable (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nitabach et al., 2006</a>). Targeted expression of NaChBac in Or42b neurons increased the olfactory sensitivity of DM1 in fed flies and resulted in a marked increase in appetitive index (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Likewise, expression of NaChBac in Or85a neurons increased activity of DM5 in starved flies and was accompanied by a significant decrease in appetitive index (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Interestingly, activation of Or85a drives down levels of behavioral attraction, but does not trigger behavioral repulsion, presumably because Or42b that is still present provides competing inputs. Thus, by increasing activity in DM1 or DM5, we were able to directly influence foraging behavior in opposite directions in a manner that mimics behavior appropriate for the corresponding metabolic state."

Previous work has implicated insulin signaling in mediating differences between rover and sitter, naturally occurring polymorphisms in the foraging gene that lead to dramatic differences in feeding behaviors (<a href=\"#bib14\">de Belle et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kent et al., 2009</a>). We also recently reported that insulin negatively regulates sNPFR gene expression in DM1 ORNs (<a href=\"#bib48\">Root et al., 2011</a>). To determine whether insulin also functions as the upstream metabolic cue regulating DTKR signaling in the Or85a/DM5 neurons, we investigated the effect of insulin signaling on the olfactory sensitivity of DM5 and appetitive behavior. We first blocked insulin signaling with wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K (<a href=\"#bib60\">Weinkove et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Root et al., 2011</a>). Flies fed with sugar and wortmannin exhibited a suppressed DM5 response that was accompanied by an increased appetitive index (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), thereby mimicking the starved state. Moreover, this suppression occurs through increased DTKR signaling, because targeted knockdown of DTKR in ORNs blocked the effect of wortmannin. We next asked whether constitutive activation of InR prevents starvation-like physiology and behavior. Indeed, ectopic expression of a constitutively active InR (InR-CA) in Or85a neurons of starved flies led to increased DM5 activity and decreased appetitive behavior (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), thereby mimicking satiety. Thus, insulin signaling in Or85a neurons gates the expression of DTKR to modulate DM5 activity and appetitive behavior."

Starved flies exhibit enhanced odor sensitivity in ORNs that mediate behavioral attraction and decreased sensitivity in ORNs that mediate behavioral aversion. This functional remodeling of the olfactory map is mediated by parallel neuromodulatory systems that act in opposing directions on olfactory attraction and aversion. In our earlier study, we showed that sNPFR signaling increases sensitivity in Or42b ORNs and thus enhances behavioral attraction (<a href=\"#bib48\">Root et al., 2011</a>). In our current study, however, we show that sNPFR signaling does not account for all changes induced by starvation in behavioral responses to a wider range of odor concentrations. Second, we show that starvation leads to a decreased sensitivity in the Or85a ORNs, an odorant channel that mediates behavioral aversion (<a href=\"#bib51\">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</a>). Third, we show that DTKR signaling mediates the reduced sensitivity in the Or85a ORNs and partly accounts for enhanced behavioral attraction to high concentrations of vinegar. Fourth, we show eliminating DTKR and sNPFR signaling pathways together fully reverses the effect of starvation on behavioral attraction across all odor concentrations tested. Finally we show evidence suggesting that the same global insulin signal regulating sNPFR expression may also regulate DTKR expression."

In the laboratory, well fed flies display very little attraction to apple cider vinegar (<a href=\"#bib48\">Root et al., 2011</a>). Low levels of vinegar are indicative of fresh fruit of limited nutritional value. Expanding odor sensitivity to lower concentrations of potential food odors may encourage flies to accept food sources of lower value. High odor concentrations typically accompany late stages of fermentation and are often aversive or uninteresting to flies. We show that starved flies are attracted to high concentrations of vinegar partly due to neuromodulatory mechanisms that enhance sensitivity in Or42b ORNs, an attractive odor channel, and partly through neuromodulatory mechanisms that reduce sensitivity in Or85a ORNs, an aversive odor channel. In our working model, behavioral attraction to higher odor concentrations of vinegar is the sum of the opposing effects of Or42b and Or85a (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). When flies face starvation, the balance of these inputs shifts to favor Or42b over Or85a inputs, as mediated by selective upregulation of sNPFR and DTKR in these ORNs, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>).

Whether these findings extend to a broad array of food associated odors and whether additional glomeruli are modulated by these neuromodulatory systems remain to be determined. In this context, we note that a recent correlational analysis predicts DM5 activity is highly correlated with behavioral attraction (<a href=\"#bib29\">Knaden et al., 2012</a>). However, this prediction has not been confirmed by direct testing of the DM5 glomerulus in behavioral experiments and is contradicted by more recent findings (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gao et al., 2015</a>), as well as the data in this paper. Thus our findings suggest that in starved flies the concentration range over which vinegar odor is attractive expands in both directions, with the acute need for caloric intake apparently outweighing considerations of food quality or risk (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

The often unique expression patterns of specific GPCRs in sensory systems highlights the flexibility conferred by this evolutionarily ancient mechanism to translate neuroendocrine signals into local shifts in neuronal excitability and network properties that ultimately lead to adaptive behaviors. sNPF shares structural and functional similarities with its vertebrate homolog, NPY (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hewes and Taghert, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 2004</a>). Both neuropeptides show roles in controlling food intake and feeding behaviors in insects and vertebrates. Interestingly, NPY is also expressed in the vertebrate olfactory bulb (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hansel et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mathieu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mousley et al., 2006</a>) and is thus positioned to shape olfactory processing during shifts in appetitive states as well. sNPF's broad expression pattern in the fly brain (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nassel et al., 2008</a>) supports the possibility it is widely used to orchestrate changes across many different neuropils to shape appetitive behaviors. Indeed, sNPF and NPF, another NPY homolog in <i>Drosophila</i>, have been shown in the fly gustatory system to control sweet and bitter taste sensitivity, respectively, in parallel but opposing directions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Inagaki et al., 2014</a>). The similar changes manifested by nutritional stress in both the olfactory and gustatory systems suggests complex networks of neuromodulators may shape sensory processing of aversive and attractive inputs differentially throughout the brain in a hunger state."

Interestingly, they seem to share roles in shaping the processing of stressful or negative sensory cues in both flies and mammals. For example, in rodents, emotional stressors cause long-lasting release of substance P to activate NK1 in the amygdala to generate anxiety-related behavior (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ebner et al., 2004</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, DTK signaling has also been shown to be critical for aggressive behaviors among male flies (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asahina et al., 2014</a>). In previous work, we showed <i>Drosophila</i> tachykinin mediates presynaptic inhibition in ORNs and detected expression in the LNs (<a href=\"#bib68\">Ignell et al., 2009</a>). In this current study, we map the locus of DTK's effects on behavioral responses to vinegar to the Or85a/DM5 ORNs using behavior and functional imaging. We also confirm that the source of the peptide is indeed the LNs as previous anatomical data had suggested (<a href=\"#bib68\">Ignell et al., 2009</a>). Thus, tachykinin's role in modulating stressful sensory inputs appears to extend to a glomerulus hardwired to behavioral aversion in the olfactory system."

Through the use of parallel neuromodulatory systems, the internal state of the organism functionally reconfigures early olfactory processing to optimize its detection of nutrients at the risk of ignoring potentially toxic food resources. It is certainly likely that neuromodulatory systems also impact and reconfigure central circuits in appetitive contexts. Thus, it will be of great interest to understand the contributions of peripheral and central circuits towards modifying appetitive behaviors."

Instead, we merely block the modulation of Or42b/DM1 activity with a sNPFR-RNAi transgene and demonstrate that this blocks the effect of starvation on the sensitivity of Or42b ORNs and on behavioral attraction. This is an important distinction, because DM1 remains responsive to vinegar even when sNPFR levels are reduced as demonstrated by our imaging data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Thus, according to our working model, because higher odor concentrations of vinegar recruit Or85a/DM5, behavioral attraction is the sum of the opposing effects of Or42b and Or85a. Removing sNPFR modulation of Or42b does not reduce behavioral attraction to the same level of fed flies because the weight of Or42b increases when Or85a activity is reduced by DTKR. This working model is supported by our observations that net behavioral attraction is not completely abolished by genetic knockdown of sNPFR.

In our current manuscript, however, we do not see any effect on Or42b sensitivity to vinegar after a DTKR-RNAi transgene is selectively targeted to this population of ORNs.
