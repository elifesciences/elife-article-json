                    "text": "Drought inhibits plant growth and can also induce premature senescence. Here we identify a transcription factor, ABA INSENSITIVE GROWTH 1 (ABIG1) required for abscisic acid (ABA) mediated growth inhibition, but not for stomatal closure. <i>ABIG1</i> mRNA levels are increased both in response to drought and in response to ABA treatment. When treated with ABA, <i>abig1</i> mutants remain greener and produce more leaves than comparable wild-type plants. When challenged with drought, <i>abig1</i> mutants have fewer yellow, senesced leaves than wild-type. Induction of ABIG1 transcription mimics ABA treatment and regulates a set of genes implicated in stress responses. We propose a model in which drought acts through ABA to increase <i>ABIG1</i> transcription which in turn restricts new shoot growth and promotes leaf senescence. The results have implications for plant breeding: the existence of a mutant that is both ABA resistant and drought resistant points to new strategies for isolating drought resistant genetic varieties."

Here we identify a transcription factor, ABA INSENSITIVE GROWTH 1 (ABIG1) required for abscisic acid (ABA) mediated growth inhibition, but not for stomatal closure. <i>ABIG1</i> mRNA levels are increased both in response to drought and in response to ABA treatment. When treated with ABA, <i>abig1</i> mutants remain greener and produce more leaves than comparable wild-type plants. When challenged with drought, <i>abig1</i> mutants have fewer yellow, senesced leaves than wild-type. Induction of ABIG1 transcription mimics ABA treatment and regulates a set of genes implicated in stress responses. We propose a model in which drought acts through ABA to increase <i>ABIG1</i> transcription which in turn restricts new shoot growth and promotes leaf senescence. The results have implications for plant breeding: the existence of a mutant that is both ABA resistant and drought resistant points to new strategies for isolating drought resistant genetic varieties."

In response to desiccation, levels of the ABA biosynthetic enzyme AtNCED3 in the vascular parenchyma increase in Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Endo et al., 2008</a>). This causes an increase in ABA which causes plants to close stomatal apertures, thus reducing water loss (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schroeder et al., 2001</a>). Increases in ABA concentration during seed development impose maturation and dormancy on seeds (<a href=\"#bib19\">Finkelstein, 2013</a>). ABA acts by binding to PYR-like co-receptors and bringing them together with PP2C family phosphatases (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cutler\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2010</a>). This frees downstream SNRK2 kinases from repression by the PP2C phosphatase, allowing the kinase to modify protein targets at the plasma membrane - to alter turgor in guard cells - or to modify a set of transcription factors - to promote maturation and dormancy in the developing seed."

ABA also can promote drought induced leaf senescence (<a href=\"#bib35\">Munn\u00e9-Bosch and Alegre, 2004</a>). Paradoxically, ABA appears to be required for growth as well. This conclusion is based on the observation that biosynthetic mutants with reduced levels of ABA are smaller than wild type plants\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Barrero et\u00a0al., 2005</a>). Supplementation with ABA restores growth of plants grown under well watered conditions indicating the growth defect is not a secondary consequence of water loss.

ABA caused fewer leaves to develop at the shoot apex, and caused leaves to have shorter petioles and smaller leaf blades. <i>abig1-1</i> mutants showed less response to ABA than wild type for leaf but not root growth: <i>abig1</i> mutants differed in their response to ABA with regard to leaf number (p(genotype by [ABA]) &lt;0.0001) and petiole length (p(genotype by [ABA]) &lt;0.02) but not root length (p(genotype by [ABA]) =\u00a00.285) as determined using a 2 way ANOVA analysis.

Since both the Ds insertion in <i>abig1-1</i> and the T-DNA insertion in <i>abig1-4</i> disrupt the gene close to its 5 prime end, this phenotypic difference is unlikely due to a difference in allele strength but rather to differences in genetic background. In support of this, the phenotype of the <i>abig1-1</i> mutation is similar to that of <i>abig1-4</i> when it is outcrossed to wild type Columbia, the background which\u00a0<i>abig1-4</i> is in (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We conclude that the <i>ABIG1</i> transcription factor accelerates leaf senescence and acts to prevent the plant from remaining erect under dry conditions.

These hormones were chosen because they have been implicated in promoting (ABA, jasmonate and ethylene) or preventing (cytokinin) senescence (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kim et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pr\u00e9 et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buchanan-Wollaston, 1996</a>). We also included a set of genes associated with chlorophyll degradation. Six genes passed this filter (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). In addition to the ABA catabolic enzyme gene, CYP707A2, induction of ABIG1 also regulates At2g17820/HK1, a gene encoding a receptor that mediates ABA, drought and salt stress responses (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wollbach et al., 2008</a>) and the gene encoding the ethylene receptor ERS2. Finally, two transcription factor genes in the jasmonate pathway, <i>ORA59</i> and <i>TIFY7</i> were down-regulated in this experiment. The identities of these regulated genes support a model in which ABIG1 promotes drought-induced senescence in part by changing the amount of ABA in the plant while also altering the sensitivity of the cell to ABA, ethylene and jasmonate. While all of these changes occur rapidly (within hours) after the induction of ABIG1 mRNA synthesis, the effects may nonetheless be indirect since these hormone pathways are known to cross-regulate one another. It is therefore unclear which of these genes are primary, direct targets of ABIG1 binding and which are secondary, indirect targets."

A role for <i>ABIG1/HAT22</i> in mediating ABA signaled growth inhibition and leaf senescence does not necessarily mean that this effect is direct nor that the pathway does not involve additional plant growth hormones. Ethylene, in particular, has been tightly linked to ABA signaling. Abscisic acid was first discovered for, and is in fact named for, its ability to promote organ abscission, a process known to be regulated by ethylene (<a href=\"#bib39\">Patterson and Bleecker, 2004</a>). More recent examples of links between ABA signaling and ethylene signaling include: Two ethylene receptors, ETR1 and ETR2, regulate the sensitivity of germination to ABA (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wilson et al., 2014</a>); Absicisic acid biosynthetic enzymes are required for ethylene signaling in the inhibition of rice root growth (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ma et al., 2014</a>); A screen for ABA insensitive mutants in Arabidopsis root growth resulted in the recovery of mutations in the ethylene signaling pathway as well as in the auxin signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib50\">Thole et al., 2014</a>). The link between ABA signaling and ethylene signaling appears to be ancient as the central signaling kinase of the ethylene signaling pathway, CTR1, mediates both ABA and ethylene signaling in the moss Physcomitrellum (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yasumura et al., 2015</a>)."

                                "text": "How can the action of ABA as a growth inhibitor in response to drought be reconciled with the reduced growth observed in ABA biosynthesis mutants? This is especially puzzling since reduced growth in both circumstances - exogenous addition of ABA and reduced ABA due to a mutation in a biosynthetic mutation - have been shown to be mediated in part through the ethylene pathway (e.g. <a href=\"#bib46\">Sharp and Noble, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Thole et al., 2014</a>) It is possible that ABA has varying effects at different doses. But it is also possible that the phenotypes\u00a0caused\u00a0by loss of function mutations in ABA biosynthesis genes\u00a0are misleading. For one thing, the phenotypes of these mutants reflect the cumulative effect of secondary, tertiary and higher order consequences of ABA deficiency throughout the history of the plant. For another, loss of function in a step of a biosynthetic pathway may cause accumulation of precursors and/or increased flow through side branches of the biosynthetic pathway. The latter appears to be the case for an earlier step in the ABA biosynthetic pathway (<a href=\"#bib3\">Avenda\u00f1o-V\u00e1zqueza, 2014</a>) and for some mutants in the auxin biosynthesis pathway (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brumos et al., 2014</a>). Thus, the phenotypes of hormone biosynthetic mutants are more correctly considered as reflecting the cumulative (over development) consequence of missing or reduced enzyme activity rather than reflecting solely the reduction in the levels of the particular hormone in question. As such, the phenotype of biosynthetic mutants may not accurately reflect the role of environmentally\u00a0induced hormone production in an otherwise normal plant."

Thus, there is potential for a close temporal and spatial linkage of increased ABA and increased <i>ABIG1</i> mRNA levels. Our experiments also show that increased ABIG1 levels have profound consequences on the plant, resulting in growth inhibition and leaf yellowing. While it is possible for ABA to formally act through <i>ABIG1</i> in a manner that does not require up-regulation of the <i>ABIG1</i> transcript, the experimental observations point to ABA up-regulation of ABIG1 transcript, through an as yet and possible indirect pathway, as a simple mechanism through which ABIG1 action is modulated by ABA.

Thus, abig1 appears to define a branch of the ABA pathway that regulates growth and leaf senescence, two under studied but important components of ABA action. Over-expression of ABIG1 using a XVE-inducible form yields expected phenotypes that are opposite to those observed in the loss-of-function mutant alleles. Using a water deprivation experiment the authors make the observation that abig1 loss-of-function mutants are more drought tolerant, as suggested by increased shoot and root growth, reduced leaf senescence, and reduced lodging. This observation suggests that selectively blocking ABA-mediated senescence might be an efficient route to improved stress tolerance and inter-related stay-green phenotypes. The authors should probably discuss this idea in the context of cytokinin as well, because the same phenotypic outcome has been engineered by using increasing cytokinin content under drought (i.e. see work from Blumwald and colleagues).</i> "

A great deal has been written about senescence and its associated molecular events, but all we can say from the work presented is that the leaves in the abig1 mutants don't yellow as much. For example, many senescence-induced genes are ABA-regulated at the transcriptional level quite quickly after ABA application and before yellowing occurs. Are the abig1 mutants defective in ABA-mediated regulation of senescence-associated transcripts?</i> "
