In contrast, studies in rodents have highlighted its role in spatial learning, supported by the discovery of place cells. Efforts to reconcile these views have found neurons in the rodent hippocampus that respond to non-spatial events but have not unequivocally dissociated the spatial and non-spatial influences on these cells. To disentangle these influences, we trained freely moving rats in trace eyeblink conditioning, a hippocampally dependent task in which the animal learns to blink in response to a tone. We show that dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons are all place cells, and do not respond to the tone when the animal is moving. When the animal is inactive, the apparent tone-evoked responses reflect an arousal-mediated resumption of place-specific firing. These results suggest that one of the main output stages of the hippocampus transmits only spatial information, even in this non-spatial task."

In contrast, studies in rodents have highlighted its role in spatial learning, supported by the discovery of place cells. Efforts to reconcile these views have found neurons in the rodent hippocampus that respond to non-spatial events but have not unequivocally dissociated the spatial and non-spatial influences on these cells. To disentangle these influences, we trained freely moving rats in trace eyeblink conditioning, a hippocampally dependent task in which the animal learns to blink in response to a tone. We show that dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons are all place cells, and do not respond to the tone when the animal is moving. When the animal is inactive, the apparent tone-evoked responses reflect an arousal-mediated resumption of place-specific firing. These results suggest that one of the main output stages of the hippocampus transmits only spatial information, even in this non-spatial task."

The discovery of place cells in rodents led to the hypothesis that the hippocampus forms a 'cognitive map' that is essential for spatial learning (<a href=\"#bib20\">O\u2019Keefe and Nadel, 1978</a>). In contrast, human studies have indicated a more general role of the hippocampus in the formation of episodic memories (<a href=\"#bib26\">Scoville and Milner, 1957</a>). In support of the latter view, electrophysiological studies in rodents have found that pyramidal neurons in the dorsal CA1 area of the hippocampus can change their firing in response to arbitrary stimuli, both spatial and non-spatial (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berger et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Wood et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Moita et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Komorowski et al., 2009</a>). However, the functional significance of these observations remains controversial because many non-spatial tasks are studied in restrained animals or under circumstances where spatial and non-spatial influences on hippocampal firing cannot be unequivocally dissociated (<a href=\"#bib21\">O\u2019Keefe, 1999</a>)."

In this task, a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS, a tone) is followed, after a short delay, by an unconditioned stimulus (US) that evokes an involuntary blink (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). With repeated presentations, the subject learns that the CS predicts the US and begins to blink in anticipation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>). Learning the CS-US association has been shown to be hippocampally\u00a0dependent in many species, including humans and rodents (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clark and Squire, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Kim et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Takehara et al., 2003</a>). Previous electrophysiological studies have found that dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons change their firing following the CS onset (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berger et al., 1976</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Weiss et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Weible et al., 2006</a>), suggesting that these cells encode the non-spatial stimulus.

Consistent with previous studies, we find that the CS can evoke significant changes in the firing rate of dorsal CA1 neurons. Additionally, we find that these apparent CS responses are spatially modulated, but surprisingly, they are absent when the animal is moving. These CS-evoked changes occur only when the animal is inactive, produce firing rates that match normal place cell activity, and are accompanied by a cessation of ripples. These observations are more consistent with an arousal-mediated resumption of place cell firing rather than a genuine encoding of the non-spatial stimuli. These results suggest that neurons in dorsal CA1, a major output stage of the hippocampus, transmit exclusively spatial signals even in this hippocampally\u00a0dependent non-spatial task."

For example, the intermittently CS-responsive neuron shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> had a place field in the right endbox, and the trials in which it fired corresponded to the trials presented within this place field (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To visualize the influence of this spatial tuning, we ordered the trials by the place field intensity at the trial delivery location (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, bottom panel). Overall, we find that the CS evokes an increase in firing when delivered within a cell\u2019s place field, and silences the cell when delivered outside its place field (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>). This correlation between CS-evoked firing and place field intensity also holds at the single-cell level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). These observations indicate that there are no CA1 neurons that respond consistently to the CS in a space-invariant fashion. Instead, the non-spatial stimulus modulates the firing of place cells."

Surprisingly, we find the opposite: CS-evoked changes in firing rate are absent when the animal is running (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and occur only when the animal is inactive (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Importantly, the lack of CS-evoked changes while running is not accompanied by an impairment of task performance (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When the animal is sitting, the CS-evoked change in firing actually reflects the fact that the pre-trial firing rates differ from the spatially\u00a0predicted rates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, grey markers). After the CS onset, firing rates re-align with the place field intensity at the present location (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, blue markers). The US evokes a response that briefly exceeds the spatially\u00a0predicted rates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, red markers), but analysis of this phenomenon is potentially confounded by head movement associated with the unconditioned response."

During periods of inactivity, animals may enter a state of quiet wakefulness, in which the firing of place cells is not exclusively governed by the animal\u2019s present location. Instead, the hippocampus exhibits other patterns of firing, such as synchronous bursts (ripples) that may engage neurons with distant place fields (<a href=\"#bib10\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Csicsvari et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Diba and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2007</a>). We find that when the animal is sitting, ripples spontaneously occur during the pre-trial period, and abruptly cease following the CS onset (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Furthermore, CS-evoked changes in firing rate are more pronounced in trials with detected ripples (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and the firing of these cells outside their place fields is closely associated with the ripple events (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These observations suggest that the animal is indeed in a state of quiet wakefulness during 'sitting' trials, and that the CS triggers an arousal response that leads to a resumption of place cell firing."

Previous studies have reported that the CS can reset the theta rhythm, aligning the phase of theta to the CS onset (<a href=\"#bib15\">Moita et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Nokia et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Darling et al., 2011</a>). To distinguish a genuine phase reset from stimulus-evoked initiation of theta oscillations, it is important to restrict our analysis to trials with ongoing theta activity prior to the CS onset. The prominent theta oscillations during running provide the ideal conditions for this analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Under these conditions, we found that both the CS and US can evoke a sustained alignment of theta phase, but only in one out of three animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Even when theta phase alignment did occur, the new phase remained highly correlated with the pre-stimulus phase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), indicating that the observed alignment is due to a subtle phase shift rather than a reset of the theta rhythm. These results confirm that it is possible for the eyeblink stimuli to perturb ongoing theta oscillations, but the absence of this perturbation in two out of three animals shows that it is not necessary to perform the task."

If the CS were able to trigger an arousal response, this would manifest as an increase in firing within a cell\u2019s place field (due to activation of place-specific firing) and a decrease in firing outside the place field (due to cessation of ripple-related firing). Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that in sitting animals, the CS indeed activates place-specific firing, silences out-of-field firing, and abolishes ripples. When the animal is already alert, such as during running, we observe no additional modulation beyond normal place field firing."

On the other hand, manipulations that decrease the salience of the CS, such as habituation to the unpaired stimuli presented to control animals, would reduce the apparent response (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berger et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Weiss et al., 1996</a>)."

Given the lack of CS-evoked firing rate changes while running, could the CS onset be encoded by this phase reset instead? Analogous to previous studies, we find evidence for an alignment of theta phase to the CS onset. However, a direct comparison of pre- and post-stimulus phase reveals that this effect is due to a slight perturbation of the ongoing theta phase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In particular, this analysis rejects the notion of theta reset to a specific phase. Furthermore, this phase perturbation is present in only one out of three animals, indicating that it is not necessary for performing the task. Moreover, we did not find evidence that theta phase precession was affected by the CS onset (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

How do our observations fit with this literature? We found that CS-evoked changes in dorsal CA1 firing rates and theta phase are not necessary for task performance\u2014these responses are absent during running, but performance is not impaired\u2014yet dorsally\u00a0restricted lesions still produce learning deficits (<a href=\"#bib28\">Takehara et al., 2003</a>). Several possible explanations may account for this apparent discrepancy: (1) Dorsal hippocampal lesions may disrupt activity in other hippocampal areas (e.g. ventral CA1), which may contain genuinely CS-responsive neurons. (2) The encoding of the CS may be more subtle than changes in firing rate, but still detectable by postsynaptic targets. (3) The critical engagement of the hippocampus may not occur only during the trial itself. Memory consolidation is hippocampally\u00a0dependent and proceeds without additional training (<a href=\"#bib28\">Takehara et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</a>), indicating that some eyeblink-related activity occurs well after the stimulus presentation. (4) Even though spatial information may appear irrelevant in this task, the presence of ongoing place-specific firing may still be necessary for learning space-invariant responses. For example, awareness of the context may be necessary for the animal to attend to the appropriate stimuli, or learning a context-dependent association may be a necessary stepping-stone to developing a space-invariant association (<a href=\"#bib17\">Nadel and Willner, 1980</a>)."

For example, we often observed a high-amplitude transient following the US delivery. This clearly skews the estimated theta phase in the vicinity of the US, but our analysis approach ensures that phase estimates 200 ms before or after the transient are unaffected. In contrast, techniques that involve the Hilbert transform or an analysis of IIR-filtered signals cannot guarantee that that the influence of such transients remain localized to a fixed time interval."

The pre-CS window ends at the CS onset, and the post-CS window starts 100 ms after that (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), therefore the pre- and post-CS phase estimates are derived from independent segments of data. To assist in comparison, we use the corresponding frequency estimates to extrapolate both phase estimates to the same point in time (the midpoint of this 100 ms gap, i.e. 50 ms after the CS onset)."

The authors examined hippocampal pyramidal cell firing during eyeblink conditioning and investigated the relationship between this and spatial firing. They report that conditioned eyeblink unit responses were not consistent, occurring preferentially within the independently mapped place field. Outside of the place field the CS silenced the cell. Furthermore, CS-evoked responses did not occur during running but only when animal was inactive. What seems to be happening is that when the animal becomes inactive in the place field the firing rate drops below what would be predicted on the basis of the active field rate and this active-movement rate is restored by the CS. As has been shown before, sharpwave ripples occurred when the animal was not moving and were inhibited by the CS. The authors conclude that the simplest explanation for their results is that all of the pyramidal cells are place cells, and that, following conditioning, the CS triggers an arousal response which leads to the resumption of the spatial firing in the place field. Importantly they find no evidence for an independent response to the CS which is not dependent on the animal's spatial location."

The CS increases arousal and via this change in state restores the firing of the cell. There is no evidence for a role of the hippocampus conditioning independent of this arousal influence on spatial firing.

Both involve auditory tone CS conditioning of eyelid shock US response (freezing in their case vs. eyeblink in this study) and both demonstrate dependency on existing place field responses. The observation of CS-evoked responses during ripple-associated immobility is novel and was not addressed in the Moira study, but in that study they did examine questions regarding theta synchronization and the possibility of type II theta during CS-associated immobility. Given the conclusion of lack of CS-independent hippocampal firing rate response, these should be addressed in the present study, with further attention to possible CS-induced changes in hippocampal response that may be relevant such as CS-dependent theta-phase effects (theta phase resetting), and impact on phase precession (if possible)."

Hence it is likely that the distribution of pre-trial brain state also shifts over the course of training.
