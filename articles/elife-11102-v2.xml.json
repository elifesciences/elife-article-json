Experiments showed co-contraction of opposing muscle groups, and indicated that symptoms depended on the interaction of brain and spinal cord. SNP mapping and exome sequencing identified the dominant causative mutation in the <i>Lamb1</i> gene. Laminins are extracellular matrix proteins, widely expressed but also known to be important in synapse structure and plasticity. In accordance, awake recording in the cerebellum detected abnormal output from a circuit of two <i>Lamb1</i>-expressing neurons, Purkinje cells and their deep cerebellar nucleus targets, during abnormal postures. We propose that dystonia-like symptoms result from lapses in descending inhibition, exposing excess activity in intrinsic spinal circuits that coordinate muscles. The mouse is a new model for testing how dysfunction in the CNS causes specific abnormal movements and postures."

Experiments showed co-contraction of opposing muscle groups, and indicated that symptoms depended on the interaction of brain and spinal cord. SNP mapping and exome sequencing identified the dominant causative mutation in the <i>Lamb1</i> gene. Laminins are extracellular matrix proteins, widely expressed but also known to be important in synapse structure and plasticity. In accordance, awake recording in the cerebellum detected abnormal output from a circuit of two <i>Lamb1</i>-expressing neurons, Purkinje cells and their deep cerebellar nucleus targets, during abnormal postures. We propose that dystonia-like symptoms result from lapses in descending inhibition, exposing excess activity in intrinsic spinal circuits that coordinate muscles. The mouse is a new model for testing how dysfunction in the CNS causes specific abnormal movements and postures."

Sometimes the movements are repetitive, for example, abnormal or spasmodic blinking. At other times, two sets of muscles that work against each other become active at the same time, which causes the body to assume a strange position. The symptoms are sometimes painful and they tend to be worse in times of stress. But many individuals with dystonia are able to develop tricks to control their symptoms. For example, some find they can stop the unwanted movements by touching their face or by walking backwards."

The mice walk and climb normally when they are in their usual cage and after they have been awake for longer periods. In the experiments, the mice underwent a series of tests to determine what caused these intermittent symptoms. The experiments suggested that hyperactive synapses in the spinal cord trigger the movements, but that the brain is often able to counteract them."

However, when abnormal movements occurred in the mutant mice, their synapses produced irregular patterns of activity.

There is strong evidence that dystonia is a circuit disorder involving various brain regions, including sensory input, premotor and motor cortex, striatum and globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus and parts of the thalamus, cerebellum, and the tracts connecting them (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berardelli et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Breakefield et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Leh\u00e9ricy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Neychev et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Quartarone and Hallett, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Thompson et al., 2011</a>). There is also decreased inhibition and a bias toward potentiation in synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hallett, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Quartarone and Pisani, 2011</a>). However, there is little certainty about exactly how circuit and synaptic abnormalities produce the persistent overflow of motor control, often involving only certain muscle groups and the co-contraction of opposing muscles. Until recently, there has been a lack of a phenotypically penetrant genetically\u00a0defined mouse model, where circuit hypotheses for mechanisms of dystonia can be tested in the context of abnormal movement (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Weisheit and Dauer, 2015</a>). The lamb1t mouse introduced here exhibits late postnatal/young adult onset of dystonia-like hindlimb movements and postures, and it has high viability, gene penetrance, and inter-individual consistency. Several aspects of its biology have parallels with dystonia, such as post-developmental onset, an ability to overcome the symptoms, and slow progression. However, the mutant mouse also has symptoms exposed by sleep and anesthesia, and these led to the demonstration that there are circuit abnormalities in the spinal cord."

Laminins are present in the extracellular matrix\u00a0(ECM) surrounding neurons where they bind to synaptic proteins, and have been implicated in synaptic and neuromuscular junction structure and plasticity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dityatev et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wlodarczyk et al., 2011</a>).

(<b><b>A</b></b>) Crossing an elevated beam to return to the home cage was tested with one cohort repeatedly at the ages shown (n = 14 WT, 10 males, 4 females, and n = 7 lamb1t, 4 males, 3 females). Symptoms normally appeared between 3 and 4 weeks of age. Young mutant mice (1\u20132 months old) tended to exhibit only slips, while mature mutant mice (3\u20136 months old) tended to have a mix of foot slips, hyperextension, and full control, and often could not stay on the beam. Traverse time and foot slip data from trials where a mouse fell were not included in the calculations, and the mouse was given another trial. (Numbers completing the task: at 4 weeks, WT 13, mutant 7; 6 and 8 weeks, WT 14, mutant 7; 12 weeks, WT 13, mutant 1; 16 weeks, WT 13, mutant 3; 23 weeks, WT 10, mutant 4.) There was no significant difference between WT and mutant in time to cross at any age (p ranged from 0.28 to 0.76). However, the data showed a significant difference in the number of foot slips during beam traverse. At 4 weeks, p = 0.0021; 6 weeks, p = 3.7 x 10<sup>\u22126</sup>; 8 weeks, p = 3.1 x 10<sup>\u22126</sup>; 12 weeks, n.a.; 16 weeks, p = 3.9x10<sup>\u221211</sup>; 23 weeks, p = 0.034 for main genotype effect (*), and Bonferroni\u2019s test confirmed significance. At 12 weeks, only one mutant mouse was able to complete the task, and the bar (\u2020) was a single data point. (<b><b>B</b></b>) In the accelerating rotarod task, both male and female mutant mice showed substantially shorter latencies to falling off.

Ages ranged from 60 to 180 days (averages WT 125 days \u00b1 47.5, SD; mutant 114 \u00b1 44.5), and there was no trend with age. (<b><b>C</b></b>) Weight gain was initially normal in lamb1t mice, but they plateaued at 3\u20134 months, likely due to the metabolic demands of elevated muscle activity. Weight as a confounding variable is not often considered in rotarod testing. Plotting the rotarod data against weight showed it to be a continuous independent variable in WT males (linear regression for WT males had a significant slope [R square = 0.6299, F = 24.99, p = 0.0002]; slopes in the other groups tested non-significant). However, the main effect of genotype dominated the results even though male lamb1t mice weighed less. (<b><b>D</b></b>) The Olympic pool (empty). Mice swam down a lane to a submerged platform.

The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) and validated by showing complete co-segregation between the mutation and the symptoms in eight littermates on the C57Bl/6 background (four with symptoms, four without), and six littermates on the mixed C57Bl/6-FVB background (three with symptoms, three without), p &lt; 10<sup>\u22128</sup> by two-tailed t-test."

The \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits each have an ECM polymerization domain at the N-terminus, and \u03b1 has a string of cell receptor-binding (G) domains at the C-terminus to bind signaling proteins like integrin and dystroglycan. All three subunits have C-terminal portions that let them associate with each other as a stable trimer of coiled-coil that forms an extended linear rod. The lamb1t premature stop codon deletes the last 57 amino acids from \u03b21\u2019s coiled-coil domain. Cells have a mechanism for degrading mRNA with premature stop codons, but when a stop codon is less than 50 bases from the final exon junction, the mRNA escapes nonsense-mediated decay (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012</a>). The lamb1t mutation is in exon 32, just 36 bases upstream of the next (and final) exon junction. In immunoblots of tissue extracts of choroid plexus (a rich source of <i>Lamb1</i> mRNA; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) from WT and mutant mice, laminin \u03b21 at ~225\u2009kDa was readily detected. The truncated form should be ~6\u2009kDa smaller, and it was resolved when electrophoresis time was extended (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In agreement with the proposal that the truncated protein is fully expressed, we did not observe a reduction in laminin \u03b21 levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>); we also saw no reduction in samples from cerebellum and sciatic nerve (not shown). Whether the truncation should disrupt the coiled coil was predicted with MultiCoil. No change was calculated for the majority of coil upstream of the truncation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), implying that mutant \u03b21 should assemble with laminin alpha and gamma subunits."

The G domain repeating globular domains are sites of attachment to cell surfaces through integrin and dystroglycan. The rod-like coiled-coil trimer domain, a quaternary structure, is altered by truncation of the last 57 amino acids in the \u03b21 subunit in lamb1t.

A phenotype was not exhibited by heterozygous <i>Lamb1</i> knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yin et al., 2003</a>). Since the heterozygotes of the knockouts and lamb1t were on the same strain background, the dominant phenotype of lamb1t must be due to assembly of altered protein rather than haploinsufficiency, suggesting a gain of function. Based on the analysis of coiled-coil propensity, the sequence predicts that the small truncation of \u03b21 should assemble with \u03b1 and \u03b3 subunits because the coiled-coil domain required for trimerization is almost intact (including residues for interchain disulfide bonds). Agrin, another important synapse-organizing ECM protein, binds to a central portion of laminin\u2019s coiled-coil domain, and interacts with \u03b31 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kammerer et al., 1999</a>), and that interaction may be preserved. The \u03b21 truncation is unlikely to impair laminin trimer integration into ECM, because integration utilizes the self-polymerization domains at the N-termini of the three subunits. However, like the <i>Lamb1</i> knockout (<a href=\"#bib33\">Miner et al., 2004</a>), lamb1t mice were embryonic lethal when homozygous, so it is essential to have one good copy in early development."

Deletion of just three amino acids from the C-terminus of either \u03b31 or \u03b32 abrogated binding of laminin to the receptor integrin, as did substitution of glutamine for glutamate at the -3 position (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ido et al., 2007</a>). Chimeras of the last 20 residues of laminin \u03b21 and \u03b22 determined selectivity among different integrins (<a href=\"#bib57\">Taniguchi et al., 2009</a>).

Thus, the 57-residue truncation in lamb1t may alter association with cell-surface receptors and affect signaling, without necessarily affecting the structural properties of laminin in the ECM. Alternatively, the truncation may destabilize the coiled-coil domain of the complex enough to make it more sensitive to regulated extracellular proteases, changing the kinetics of protease-mediated synaptic processes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dityatev et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wlodarczyk et al., 2011</a>)."

This outcome was less severe than the in\u00a0utero lethality of homozygous lamb1t mutation, but similar brain dysplasia was seen in homozygous mouse knockouts of <i>Lamb2</i> and <i>Lamc3</i> (<a href=\"#bib43\">Radner et al., 2013</a>). The COB mutations had much larger truncations (via frameshifts) than lamb1t\u2019s, which eliminated the coiled-coil domain and would prevent trimerization if expressed. The frameshifts should also trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012</a>), which in homozygous patients would be equivalent to knockout of <i>LAMB1</i>. Either problem would explain the fact that COB gene carriers in the families were asymptomatic, like the asymptomatic heterozygous <i>Lamb1</i> knockout mice. Given the high level of mRNA for <i>Lamb1</i> in choroid plexus of mice, it is of interest that the <i>LAMB1</i> homozygous COB patients also had hydrocephalus, likely due to impaired ECM structural integrity in the choroid plexus. We predict that if laminin mutations functionally equivalent to lamb1t are eventually found in patients, they should be limited to residues that interfere with receptor binding, but not with laminin assembly and ECM integrity."

Molecular mechanisms of learning and memory were investigated by gene manipulation in vivo in rat hippocampus in combination with water maze testing (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yang et al., 2011</a>).

A plasticity cascade entails JAK/STAT activation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nicolas et al., 2012</a>). Maze learning downregulated STAT1, and STAT1 overexpression impaired maze learning while strongly upregulating <i>Lamb1</i>. In a crucial experiment, the effect of STAT1 on maze performance was blocked by siRNA for <i>Lamb1</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hsu et al., 2014</a>).

None of these mechanistic aspects can be ruled out in the lamb1t mouse, and the possibility that the laminin \u03b21 truncation affects synapse organization and plasticity is compatible with all. The post-development onset, slow progression, and plateau of symptoms resembles progression and stabilization in human dystonias. The ability to overcome symptoms resembles the human ability to use sensory tricks, such as touching the face, to temporarily overcome dystonia (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ramos et al., 2014</a>). However, in dystonic humans, a rapid alternation of affected muscle groups is unlikely, as seen here when mice switch affected hindlimbs. Furthermore, while electromyographic (EMG) activity persists in sleep in a few forms of human dystonia (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sforza et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Stamelou et al., 2012</a>), it is not typical. Research on focal dystonia patients suggests altered spinal reflexes and failure of reciprocal inhibition in spinal circuits as the immediate cause of co-contraction (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berardelli et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Panizza et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sabbahi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tanabe et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Thompson et al., 2011</a>).

These aspects are consistent with traits of the lamb1t mouse, and share with it the convergence of abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord. However, CNS lesions causing human secondary dystonia tend to be in basal ganglia and their connections (<a href=\"#bib58\">Thompson et al., 2011</a>). This would be conceptually consistent with the lamb1t mouse\u2019s characteristics if typical dystonia-causing human lesions damage the ability of the brain to control (inhibit) circuits in the spinal cord."

Caution should be used before assuming that the causative functional defect is in the spinal cord, however, because one fundamental way that motor output is controlled is gradual enhancement of spinal reflex strength by the brain via descending signals, causing long-term scaling changes in the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Spinal circuit abnormalities might accrue slowly secondary to a primary defect in the brain. This would be congruent with slow symptom progression in the mouse, and brain\u2013spinal cord interaction might underlie the slow therapeutic response to deep brain stimulation in patients."

                                "text": "Available data ruled out other diagnoses such as myotonia, neuromyotonia, neuropathy, or muscular dystrophy. The features of lamb1t mice are <i>ab initio</i> different from spasticity (a form of hypertonicity, clinically defined as velocity-dependent resistance to muscle stretch). In spinal injury or upper motor neuron disease, spasticity results from spinal reflex changes secondary to missing input from upper motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sheean, 2002</a>). Here, there was never paralysis preceding onset of dystonic symptoms; the mice could run voluntarily; and the symptoms were intermittent. It remains to be seen, however, whether abnormalities in descending inhibition, for example in the output of the pontine inhibitory region, can elicit spasticity-like changes in the spinal cord. Changes in spinal circuits (such as the serotonin supersensitivity of coordinated muscle activation by central pattern generators in spasticity [<a href=\"#bib18\">Husch et al., 2012</a>]) could be endophenotypes that are actually shared by dystonia and spasticity, globally or focally. Clinical spasticity can also be accompanied by spasms of muscle contraction, which are potentially related to the motor unit-driven twitches seen in lamb1t under sleep and anesthesia. At this stage, the relationship of the lamb1t mouse to human dystonia is tentative, but supported by a compatible distribution of gene expression in subcortical motor circuits (and not in motor neurons), and by empirical similarities that are likely to reflect shared cellular mechanisms."

Although the basal ganglia may control the inhibition of unwanted activity, overactive pattern generators in the spinal cord appear to be the proximal cause of co-contraction in lamb1t. It is likely that some spinal central pattern generator circuits normally generate co-contraction, such as for postural control (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blood, 2008</a>), just as others generate alternating contraction for locomotion (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). Lamb1t\u2019s aberrant spinal activity may be essential for its manifestation of dystonic movements and postures. In awake lamb1t mice, we predict that the lapses in motor control that produce dystonic movements are failures (due to mutation) of supraspinal inhibitory control originating in familiar dystonia circuits, and modulated by arousal or stress."

We performed all experiments between 2 pm and 7 pm except sleep observations, which were from 8 am to 3 pm. For gait analysis, a DigiGait apparatus (Mouse Specifics, Framingham, MA) was used for ventral plane videography of mouse gait kinematics on a moving transparent treadmill belt. Mice were tested in late afternoon close to the beginning of the active period. Each mouse was given 4\u20136 trials at 15 cm/s, a relatively slow treadmill speed even compared to mice with ethanol or basal ganglia toxin-induced gait impairment (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amende et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kale et al., 2004</a>). The balance beam was a 120 cm rectangular rod 1.6 cm in width held 30 cm above the padded surface, resting at one end on the edge of the home cage, which was shaded with a dark box. The accelerating Rotarod test (Rotamex, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) entailed accelerating the rod from 4 rpm to 40 rpm over 180\u2009s. Mice were trained for 2 days, 2 trials per day, with a 5-min break between trials. The results of the\u00a0two trials were recorded on the third day. To test swimming speed, we developed a test that was named Olympic pool. A 86 x 46 cm plastic storage box (Sterilite 1764; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) was divided into four equal lanes with opaque plastic dividers, and a 5-cm-wide submerged Styrofoam platform was fastened at one end of each lane. The pool was filled with room temperature water 20 cm deep, just over the platform. The starting point was marked so that the total length for mice to swim was 71 cm (28\u201d). Training consisted of putting the mouse in the water at the opposite end once and allowing it to find the platform. On subsequent trials they would swim to it in seconds, and the measured parameter was swimming speed. For activity analysis, we used an OPTO-Varimex Minor activity meter (Columbus Instruments) to monitor activity for 10\u2009min by optical beam-breaks, using an empty rat cage (37 x 25 x 19 cm) as the chamber. Mice were introduced to the activity chamber as a novel environment, and beam-breaks were recorded for the first 10\u2009min. The groups were matched for average age (WT average 130 \u00b1 27 days; mutant 127 \u00b1 28). WT mice were 11% heavier than lamb1t in males and 5% heavier in females. To detect impairment of forelimb function, the adhesive removal test was performed, in which a sticky square (5 mm squares of Post-it) was applied to the forehead. The time to brush it off was recorded (with a 60\u2009s cut-off), and two trials were averaged. Replicate trials of individuals were combined and averaged. To assess grip strength and skill, a food rack from a rat cage was prepared by covering the edges with a\u00a03-cm-wide masking tape to prevent mice from climbing to the top. Each mouse was placed in the middle and the rack was shaken laterally three times to make them grip it well. It was then inverted 30 cm above a well-padded surface. The time spent clinging to (or climbing around on) the rack was recorded, and the test was terminated after 60\u2009s."

Behavioral experiments were not designed a priori for parametric statistical analysis because, besides normal sources of variance, there was additional variance stemming from lamb1t\u2019s responses to stress and their ability to also bring motor behavior under control. The behavioral performance of the mutant was sometimes neither normally distributed nor of equal variance compared to WT, often in the tests measuring obvious abnormalities. All the available mice of appropriate age were tested since there was no ethical reason to limit group size. Statistical significance was estimated using two-way ANOVA followed by software-provided post-hoc multiple comparison tests, or two-tailed independent Student\u2019s t-test, and considered significant at p&lt;0.05. Where error bars are shown, compiled data are reported as means \u00b1 SEM. Where variance was large, the data are shown as scatter plots. No outlying data points were excluded except in two cases: when a mouse was unable to stay on the elevated beam at all, and on the rotarod, when a mouse turned around to face the wrong way. All replicates were biological replicates; when duplicate trials of individuals were averaged and used as single data points, it is stated in the legend. Because the lamb1t symptoms in the C57Bl/6N strain background are obvious, it was not possible to perform behavioral tests blinded. Although we used many of the behavioral tests on B6/FVB hybrids to assess phenotype, only C57Bl/6N strain results are presented here, except that hybrids were also included for observations of hindlimb activity during sleep.

Supramaximal responses were gradually generated, and maximal responses were obtained with stimulus currents &lt;20 mA (most often &lt;10 mA). The distance between distal and proximal stimulation sites was measured with a millimeter-graduated tape measure. Data were acquired with a sensitivity of 20 mV/division and sweep speed of 3 ms/division. The distal latency, distal and proximal compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitudes, distal and proximal CMAP durations (measured from onset of initial negative deflection to initial return to baseline), and conduction velocity were determined for each nerve studied."

A recording area 2 mm wide was drilled in the skull on top of the cerebellum at AP: \u22126.25 mm; ML: \u00b1 1.7 mm. The recording area was surrounded with dental cement and covered with surgifoam and bone wax (Ethicon). Mice were allowed to recover 24\u2009hr before recording sessions. For recordings, the mouse was immobilized by fixing the head bracket with a screw attached to the stereotaxic frame. The bone wax and surgifoam were removed from the recording area. Single-unit neural activity was recorded extracellularly in awake head-restrained mice using a carbon fiber electrode (Kation Scientific, 0.4\u20131.2 M\u03a9). The electrode was advanced into the cerebellum to target the Purkinje cells and neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Cell types were identified based on location and the presence of complex spikes in Purkinje cells. Signals were band-pass filtered (200\u2009Hz-20 kHz), amplified (2000 x), and digitized (20 kHz). Waveforms were sorted offline (Plexon) using principal component analysis. During recordings the mouse was closely monitored. Abnormal postures could clearly be seen and these periods were noted. Cells recorded during these episodes were noted as 'abnormal postures', while all other cells recorded when the mouse did not show abnormal postures were categorized as 'no postures'."
