Here we use whole genome reconstruction of human fecal and subsurface aquifer metagenomic samples to obtain complete genomes for members of a new candidate phylum sibling to Cyanobacteria, for which we propose the designation \u2018Melainabacteria\u2019. Metabolic analysis suggests that the ancestors to both lineages were non-photosynthetic, anaerobic, motile, and obligately fermentative. Cyanobacterial light sensing may have been facilitated by regulators present in the ancestor of these lineages. The subsurface organism has the capacity for nitrogen fixation using a nitrogenase distinct from that in Cyanobacteria, suggesting nitrogen fixation evolved separately in the two lineages. We hypothesize that Cyanobacteria split from Melainabacteria prior or due to the acquisition of oxygenic photosynthesis. Melainabacteria remained in anoxic zones and differentiated by niche adaptation, including for symbiosis in the mammalian gut."

Here we use whole genome reconstruction of human fecal and subsurface aquifer metagenomic samples to obtain complete genomes for members of a new candidate phylum sibling to Cyanobacteria, for which we propose the designation \u2018Melainabacteria\u2019. Metabolic analysis suggests that the ancestors to both lineages were non-photosynthetic, anaerobic, motile, and obligately fermentative. Cyanobacterial light sensing may have been facilitated by regulators present in the ancestor of these lineages. The subsurface organism has the capacity for nitrogen fixation using a nitrogenase distinct from that in Cyanobacteria, suggesting nitrogen fixation evolved separately in the two lineages. We hypothesize that Cyanobacteria split from Melainabacteria prior or due to the acquisition of oxygenic photosynthesis. Melainabacteria remained in anoxic zones and differentiated by niche adaptation, including for symbiosis in the mammalian gut."

Cyanobacteria are presumed responsible for this geochemical revolution, as they comprise the sole lineage known to have innovated the production of oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib51\">Mulkidjanian et al., 2006</a>). Further, nitrogen fixation by Cyanobacteria is central to the Earth\u2019s nitrogen cycle (<a href=\"#bib73\">Vitousek et al., 2002</a>). Cyanobacteria are inferred to be one of the earliest branching bacterial lineages (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altermann and Kazmierczak, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bekker et al., 2004</a>) and have diversified across environments\u2014land, fresh, and salt water, and all levels of the photic zone (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dworkin, 2006</a>). Via endosymbiosis, Cyanobacteria became the chloroplasts of plants (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sagan, 1967</a>), a role that underlines their broad evolutionary importance."

The presence of organisms related to Cyanobacteria in the gut is notable because they are widely shared across individuals (<a href=\"#bib11\">Consortium HMP, 2012</a>), where members of this group can comprise up to 20% of the total sequences recovered from stool (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dethlefsen and Relman, 2011</a>), as well as shared across various mammalian species (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ley et al., 2008</a>). As Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms, it has been assumed that these sequences represent genomic material derived from ingestion of chloroplasts or Cyanobacterial cells (<a href=\"#bib70\">Turnbaugh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Koenig et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Consortium HMP, 2012</a>).

The bacterial communities of human fecal samples A, B, and C are typical of human fecal microbiota, as they are predominantly composed of members of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with a few other phyla represented (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Consortium HMP, 2012</a>).

Our curation method verified unique paired read placement throughout the reconstructed genomes, a requirement consistent with standard methods of isolate genomics. All scaffolds identified as deriving from an organism with some similarity to Cyanobacteria, based on the phylogenetic profile of the encoded genes, were incorporated into the closed, complete genomes. Additional small scaffolds were identified and incorporated using paired read placement. The phylogenetic signal for novelty was robust, because essentially all other genomic fragments (excluding phage and plasmids) shared high similarity with genomes of previously sequenced organisms."

Three subgroups are revealed, one of which comprises sequences obtained from animal guts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the gut and aquifer bacteria share no more than 84% identity to Cyanobacterial sequences, consistent with placement of these organisms in a new candidate phylum (&lt;85% identity, as suggested previously [<a href=\"#bib30\">Hugenholtz et al., 1998</a>]). The bacterial tree has been described as a polytomy due to the inability of 16S rRNA gene phylogenies to capture any specific branching order for the phyla (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pace, 1997</a>), so this phylum is unusual in its robustly supported relationship to Cyanobacteria. To further substantiate this evolutionary relationship, we constructed a phylogeny of concatenated ribosomal protein sequences (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). The result shows that the eight new genomes form a monophyletic lineage that branches deeply from the Cyanobacterial lineage, with ACD20 basal to the group (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Importantly, a common ancestor for these organisms and photosynthetic Cyanobacteria is well supported (100/100 bootstrap bipartitions) in both trees. With the sum of this evidence, we designate these bacteria as the new candidate phylum Melainabacteria, where \u2018melaina\u2019 refers to the Greek nymph of dark waters."

Also absent are genes for soluble (e.g., plastocyanin or photosynthetic ferredoxin) and membrane-affiliated electron carrier proteins (e.g., cytochromes, quinones, Fe-S, or flavin). Additionally, we found no genes for aerobic respiration including terminal quinol and cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidases, terminal reductases involved in anaerobic respiration (e.g., fumarate, nitrate), or carbon fixation pathways.

The histidine kinase NblS in Cyanobacteria preserves the photosynthetic machinery by regulating its expression and degradation under high and blue/UV-A conditions (<a href=\"#bib71\">van Waasbergen et al., 2002</a>). RpaA and RpaB are found in all Cyanobacteria (<a href=\"#bib51\">Mulkidjanian et al., 2006</a>), where they regulate the circadian clock KaiABC (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hanaoka et al., 2012</a>) and link energy transfer between the antennae and the photosystem (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ashby and Mullineaux, 1999</a>). The four complete genomes of Melainabacteria lack SasA, which typically functions as the sensor to the response regulators RpaA and RpaB (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hanaoka et al., 2012</a>), as well as any photosynthetic machinery, which suggests that these proteins may have another function. Similarly, the NblS homolog in the gut and aquifer Melainabacteria most likely has a different function. The current KEGG database (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kanehisa et al., 2012</a>) indicates that RpaA and NblS are exclusive to Cyanobacteria. RpaB is likely also exclusive to Cyanobacteria; however, given this gene\u2019s similarity to other response regulators it could be considered present in two other bacterial genomes, <i>Variovorax paradoxus</i> and <i>Desulfomicrobium baculatum</i>.

LPS, Lipid A, and O-antigen are components of the Gram-negative outer membrane; in contrast, Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer membrane and therefore lack these structures (<a href=\"#bib56\">Purves et al., 2003</a>). This finding is significant, because many genes in the newly reconstructed genomes share closest sequence similarity to Gram-positive members of the Firmicutes (see below). As previously mentioned, the genomes encode a homolog to an S-layer-like protein, suggesting that the cell envelope has an S-layer. S-layers and O-antigens have both been previously observed on photosynthetic Cyanobacteria (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hoiczyk and Hansel, 2000</a>).

We predict that Melainabacteria can use a wide variety of carbon compounds, including hemicellulosic compounds (only ACD20), polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and simple sugars, as well as organic acids, amino acids, and fatty acids to yield hydrogen, lactate, acetate (ACD20), formate (Gut), hydrogen, possibly butyrate (ACD20) and ethanol (Gut) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Specific sugars predicted to be fermented are glucose, fructose, sorbitol, mannose, trehalose, starch, glycogen, hemicellulose, and amylose, and the relevant enzymes are \u03b1-galactosidase, \u03b2-galactosidase, \u03b1-glucosidase, \u03b2-glucosidase, \u03b2-glucuronidase, \u03b2-fructofranosidase (sucrase), \u03b1-mannosidase, pullulanase, \u03b1-amylase, and endo-1, 4-beta-xylanase. These enzymes facilitate the utilization of a variety of sugar compounds by degrading the compounds into simpler sugars that can enter the main Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) glycolytic pathway. This pathway contains not the classical ATP-dependent enzyme, but a pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, a gene found in diverse organisms capable of anaerobic glycolysis (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mertens, 1991</a>). This difference in phosphoryl donor specificity may confer an energetic advantage to the cell when glycolysis is the primary source of ATP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, gene 3). The genomes have the genes necessary for hexose interconversion in the EMP pathway via the pentose phosphate pathway, such that ribose, arabinose, xylulose, and other five-carbon sugar or sugar-alcohols may be utilized. Unlike most Cyanobacteria, which use internal carbon pools for fermentation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Stal and Moezelaar, 1997</a>), Melainabacteria likely acquire sugars and sugar-alcohols from the environment via a variety of cytoplasmic membrane permeases (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Overall, the cells are inferred to have a lifestyle analogous to anaerobic obligate fermentative bacteria known to play an important role in carbon transformation in gut (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mackie, 2002</a>) and subsurface systems."

The gut Melainabacteria FeFe hydrogenase has a complete L1 motif but lacks L2 and L3 motifs. These hydrogenases may indicate an ecological role in H<sub>2</sub> production in both gut and subsurface systems: syntenic homologs for the three subunits have been identified in genomes of obligate syntrophs and fermenters known to produce high molar ratios of H<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sieber et al., 2012</a>). The production of H<sub>2</sub> typically requires a syntrophic association with an H<sub>2</sub>-consuming partner to maintain low partial hydrogen pressures. Therefore, in addition to being anaerobic fermenters, the Melainabacteria may be H<sub>2</sub> producers living in syntrophy with archaeal methanogens or bacterial acetogens in the human gut and with respiring organisms in the subsurface."

Both the ACD20 and MEL.B2 genomes encode isocitrate dehydrogenase and fumarase, whose end-products are important intermediates in nitrogen assimilation and amino acid pathways. Unlike the genomes of the gut bacteria, ACD20 can augment glycolytic ATP substrate-level phosphorylation with additional ATP generation using TCA cycle intermediates. For example, unidirectional aspartate ammonia-lyase, fumarase, and malic enzyme can convert amino acids (alanine and aspartate) and organic acids to pyruvate and ultimately acetate with ATP generation. Also, like citrate fermentation in <i>Klebsiella pneuemoniae</i> (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dimroth, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dimroth and Schink, 1998</a>), ACD20 may use citrate lyase in conjunction with the combined action of membrane-bound oxaloacetate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.3) to pump sodium ions. Combined with a sodium-hydrogen antiporter, a hydrogen gradient can be generated and used to drive cellular processes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, blue arrows). Hence, the TCA cycle does not appear to function as it does in most Cyanobacteria, where it generates reducing equivalents for oxidative phosphorylation, but rather links to nitrogen metabolism and organic acid fermentation for energy generation."

The large and small subunit of the glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT) system, responsible for nitrogen assimilation in Melainabacteria, are NADP<sup>+</sup>-based. This finding distinguishes Melainabacteria from known Cyanobacteria, which use either a 3Fe-4S ferredoxin-dependent monomeric enzyme or a two subunit NADH-dependent GOGAT (<a href=\"#bib52\">Muro-Pastor et al., 2005</a>). While a common nitrogenase could have existed in the ancestor of Melainabacteria and Cyanobacteria, the extant capacity to fix and assimilate nitrogen appears to have been acquired independently in Cyanobacteria and this sibling lineage."

All four of the analyzed genomes contain genes for flagella production, and all but one of the analyzed gut genomes (MEL.A1) contains the requisite genes to produce a fully functional flagellum (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The flagella are composed of the M, S, P, and L rings, as expected given a Gram-negative cell envelope (<a href=\"#bib16\">DePamphilis and Adler, 1971</a>). At least one copy of the flagellin protein in each Melainabacteria genome contains the eight amino acid sequence recognized by Toll-like receptor 5 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersen-Nissen et al., 2005</a>), indicating an ability to interact with the host immune system (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Trees built using flagellum-related gene sequences show that the genes branch deeply with the Firmicutes and Spirochaetes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), arguably the two most basal bacterial lineages (<a href=\"#bib15\">Daubin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ciccarelli et al., 2006</a>). This result suggests that the common ancestor of Cyanobacteria and Melainabacteria may have been flagellated. Given that no flagellated Cyanobacteria are known and cyanobacterial motility is accomplished by gliding or twitching (<a href=\"#bib60\">Schaechter, 2010</a>), flagella may have been non-essential to the cyanobacterial lifestyle and hence lost. However, it is not possible to rule out the alternative of flagella being acquired by Melainabacteria after the divergence from Cyanobacteria."

Though we cannot rule out the existence of an ancient nitrogenase common in both lineages, this finding suggests that acquisition of nitrogen fixation occurred after Cyanobacteria and Melainabacteria diverged. This sequence of events is in agreement with other theories, which place the development of photosynthesis before nitrogen fixation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sanchez-Baracaldo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shi and Falkowski, 2008</a>). Thus, we speculate that Cyanobacteria gained the capacities for oxygenic photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation and lost or never gained flagella after diverging from Melainabacteria. Melainabacteria on the other hand, gained or maintained flagella, a fermentation system, and an array of carbon transporters. One environmental (non-gut) lineage of Melainabacteria acquired nitrogen fixation, whereas the gut lineage capitalized on its ability to ferment diverse carbon sources, including those recalcitrant to host digestion."

The inferred lifestyle is consistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that the common ancestor of extant bacteria relied on anaerobic decomposition of organic material by substrate-level phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Egami, 1977</a>) and was likely metabolically similar to the Firmicutes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Daubin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ciccarelli et al., 2006</a>)."

Our results suggest that while photosynthesis probably developed in Cyanobacteria after the separation from Melainabacteria, the evolution of light related capabilities may have been enabled by regulators present in their common ancestor. The ability to fix nitrogen appears to have developed separately in Cyanobacteria and the water-soil-sediment clade of Melainabacteria. The role of the Melainabacteria in the human gut is one of an obligate fermenter, and its enrichment in human subjects and animals with a plant-rich diet likely relates to a prominent role of the Melainabacteria in the processing of plant fibers. As plant fibers have been minimized in Western diets, the Melainabacteria may be regarded as part of the microbiota that is disappearing from modernized populations (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blaser and Falkow, 2009</a>). The metabolic reconstructions made from these genomes should guide efforts into obtaining Melainabacteria in culture, which would allow a better understanding of this important human symbiont."

As you will see, the process is very well controlled and relies on information from multiple independent sources that were used for verifying the assembly. Our criteria for defining complete genomes are very stringent and include far more than the presence of all 57 single copy genes. Specifically, we resolved all connections between assembled scaffolds assigned to the genome. This last criterion makes it very unlikely that parts of the genome will be left out or that foreign fragments will be added to the genome. In fact, given the absence of genome amplification, it is likely that the genomes recovered using these methods are more complete and at least as accurate as genomes recovered by single cell genomics, the widely accepted method for studying uncultivated microbes. Further supporting the veracity of the assemblies, the identification of scaffolds that belong to these genomes was very simple. Beyond this step, the process is very similar to culture-based genomics. Please note that reconstructing genomes from metagenomic data is not a new approach and has a long history in both the Banfield Lab (e.g., Tyson et al., Nature, 2004; Lo et al. Nature, 2007; Aliaga Goltsman et al. Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 2009; Baker et al.

However we recently had the opportunity to validate the assembly of a genome recovered by us from subsurface sediment (Castelle et al., Nature Communications, in press) that was assembled using very similar methods to those used here. The validation was done using long reads (\u223c8 kbp) that were sequenced from the same sample using the Moleculo sequencing technology. 322 of the 340 reads (95%) belonging to the genome aligned perfectly to the assembled genome. Disagreements between the remaining 18 reads and the assembled genome were checked and found to be the result of 11 local mis-assemblies of a few hundred base pairs each (compared to a genome size of 2.2 Mbp). These localized mis-assemblies would also have arisen in an isolate genome assembly. Hence, this experiment provides independent verification of the reliability of our metagenomic genome recovery method."

This decision is supported by commonly accepted criteria for defining new phyla (16S rRNA similarity to known phyla \u2013 see text) and we thank the reviewers for raising this important issue. We do insist however that the new genomes are the closest relatives to Cyanobacteria that have been sequenced to date. This relies on both 16S rRNA phylogeny, which is the accepted gold standard for inferring phylogenetic relations, and also phylogeny that is based on concatenated ribosomal proteins, which have proved to be very reliable."

As an aside, we mention that the group of organisms reported in this study was included in the 200 \u201cmost wanted genomes\u201d of the NIH Human Microbiome Project, which underscores the interest of the human microbiome community in these organisms. Taken together, we strongly believe that the results reported here are of interest for a wide range of researchers as expected from a paper submitted to a wide audience journal such as <i>eLife</i>."

We have also removed the sentence from the Discussion that mentioned our attempts to culture this group. This is because one of us (Ruth) felt that our attempts had been somewhat haphazard, and since culturing anaerobes is not one of our core specialties, this information is not likely to be informative (i.e., another more specialized group may succeed using these methods)."
