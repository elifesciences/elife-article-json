Here, we have chronicled the dynamics of protein and mRNA expression levels across a minimally perturbed cell cycle in human myeloid leukemia cells using centrifugal elutriation combined with mass spectrometry-based proteomics and RNA-Seq, avoiding artificial synchronization procedures. We identify myeloid-specific gene expression and variations in protein abundance, isoform expression and phosphorylation at different cell cycle stages. We dissect the relationship between protein and mRNA levels for both bulk gene expression and for over \u223c6000 genes individually across the cell cycle, revealing complex, gene-specific patterns. This data set, one of the deepest surveys to date of gene expression in human cells, is presented in an online, searchable database, the Encyclopedia of Proteome Dynamics (<a href=\"http://www.peptracker.com/epd/\">http://www.peptracker.com/epd/</a>)."

The combined data set provides evidence of protein-level expression of over 11,000 genes.

The cDNA was then sequenced using paired ends reads at a length of 75 bp. Each sample was run on a single lane of an Illumina HiSeq, to improve coverage of lower abundance transcripts. The paired-end RNA-Seq data were then aligned to the human genome (build hg19), using TopHat, without providing a gene reference (to avoid forced mappings). Following duplicate removal using Picard\u2019s MarkDuplicate (<a href=\"http://picard.sourceforge.net\">http://picard.sourceforge.net</a>), we quantified the gene expression of known protein coding genes using Cufflinks (<a href=\"#bib78\">Trapnell et al., 2013</a>).

Here, we have chronicled the dynamics of protein and mRNA expression levels across a minimally perturbed cell cycle in human myeloid leukemia cells using centrifugal elutriation combined with mass spectrometry-based proteomics and RNA-Seq, avoiding artificial synchronization procedures. We identify myeloid-specific gene expression and variations in protein abundance, isoform expression and phosphorylation at different cell cycle stages. We dissect the relationship between protein and mRNA levels for both bulk gene expression and for over \u223c6000 genes individually across the cell cycle, revealing complex, gene-specific patterns. This data set, one of the deepest surveys to date of gene expression in human cells, is presented in an online, searchable database, the Encyclopedia of Proteome Dynamics (<a href=\"http://www.peptracker.com/epd/\">http://www.peptracker.com/epd/</a>)."

In total, the meta-analysis included protein data from 14 cell line proteomes: 3 \u00d7 HeLa, 2 \u00d7 U2OS, A549, GAMG, HEK293, K562, LnCap, MCF7, RKO, HepG2, and Jurkat-T (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lundberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Beck et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Nagaraj et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Geiger et al., 2012</a>), which were consolidated and mapped to Ensembl Genes prior to comparison. The combined data set provides evidence of protein-level expression of over 11,000 genes. Of these, a common set of \u223c3000 genes are identified by protein data from all these cell lines, defining a core, shared proteome (Columns D and E), and &gt;1000 genes are uniquely detected in this analysis of NB4 cells (Columns A and B).

The cDNA was then sequenced using paired ends reads at a length of 75 bp. Each sample was run on a single lane of an Illumina HiSeq, to improve coverage of lower abundance transcripts. The paired-end RNA-Seq data were then aligned to the human genome (build hg19), using TopHat, without providing a gene reference (to avoid forced mappings). Following duplicate removal using Picard\u2019s MarkDuplicate (<a href=\"http://picard.sourceforge.net\">http://picard.sourceforge.net</a>), we quantified the gene expression of known protein coding genes using Cufflinks (<a href=\"#bib78\">Trapnell et al., 2013</a>).

This in turn has allowed studies, in both model organisms and human cells, which seek to document global proteomes and transcriptomes. For example, several laboratories have performed in-depth proteomic profiling of different human cell lines and independently concluded that the minimum number of proteins expressed in each cell line is on the order of 10,000 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beck et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Nagaraj et al., 2011</a>). In a more recent study, the proteomes of 11 cell lines were profiled to a similar depth (<a href=\"#bib23\">Geiger et al., 2012</a>). These data enable comparison of protein expression levels between cells that differ in tissue type, developmental origin, and mode of in vitro culture. At the transcriptome level, microarray analysis and RNA-Seq have been used to document global mRNA expression across extensive panels of human cells and tissues (<a href=\"#bib66\">Ramaswamy et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Su et al., 2002</a>), and to examine features of RNA regulation, such as alternative splicing (<a href=\"#bib11\">Braunschweig et al., 2013</a>)."

The relationship between protein and mRNA abundance remains a topic of debate and the studies above highlight the challenges of relying on analysis of mRNA alone to measure gene expression at the protein level. High throughput methods have also been used to analyze changes in gene expression in response to specific events, including cell cycle progression. Our objective in this study was to capitalize on these technological advances to provide an in-depth characterization of gene expression in human cells, including cell cycle-associated changes in the proteome and transcriptome. We thus address the key question of how different layers of gene expression affect corresponding levels of protein and mRNA in a biologically important, dynamic system."

Regulation of the cell cycle is important for controlling cell growth and proliferation and for coordinating the timing of major cellular events, such as DNA replication and cell division (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hunter and Pines 1994</a>). Regulatory pathways and checkpoints allow cells to respond quickly to DNA damage and other forms of stress that require cell cycle arrest to prevent uncontrolled cell division (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hartwell and Kastan, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">King et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Elledge, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Pines, 1999</a>). Many signaling mechanisms also impact on the control of cell cycle to allow cells to grow and divide in response to both developmental and environmental cues. Misregulation of the cell cycle machinery can lead to inappropriate cell proliferation, as often seen in neoplastic disease."

Most cell cycle analyzes make use of cell synchronization methods to enrich populations of cells at specific cell cycle stages in sufficient quantities for biochemical characterization. For example, multiple strategies have been used to characterize levels of mRNA expression at different cell cycle stages in the budding yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, including conditional knockdown of cell cycle regulators, withdrawal of growth factors, use of chemical inhibitors and physical size separation by centrifugal elutriation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cho et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Spellman et al., 1998</a>). Large-scale transcriptome analyzes have also been performed in mammalian cells, particularly in HeLa cells, to compare mRNA expression levels across the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cho et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Whitfield et al., 2002</a>). More recently, several groups have also examined cell cycle variation in the mammalian proteome and phosphoproteome in cell line models (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ohta et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Olsen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Pagliuca et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lane et al., 2013</a>). The established methods to achieve highly synchronized mammalian cells usually involve arresting cells, either by inducible genetic depletion of factors needed to drive cell progression, or by drug treatments that either activate checkpoints, block major metabolic pathways, or else disrupt the mitotic spindle. Inhibiting or depleting essential factors and activities needed for proper cell cycle progression, however, may in turn cause side effects that alter gene expression independent from direct, cell cycle-based regulation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cooper et al., 2007</a>)."

In contrast to epithelial tumor cell lines, large-scale studies examining protein expression in hematopoietic cells are sparse, with the Jurkat-T and K562 cell lines being the only immune cell lines comprehensively profiled (<a href=\"#bib23\">Geiger et al., 2012</a>).

To achieve this, we analyzed the human NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cell line using a strategy that combines centrifugal elutriation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Banfalvi, 2008</a>), a physical method of enriching cell populations at different cell cycle stages, with high throughput analyzes of both protein and poly(A)+ mRNA levels. This strategy is outlined schematically in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. First, six elutriated fractions were collected from an unsynchronized population of NB4 cells grown in normal, label free medium. Second, to obtain deep proteomic information with high peptide and protein coverage, extracted proteins from each elutriated fraction were digested with trypsin and/or LysC and further fractionated by offline peptide chromatography prior to mass spectrometric analysis. As described below, this allowed quantitative profiling of the NB4 proteome to a depth of &gt;10,000 proteins, with high mean sequence coverage (\u223c38%). Third, poly(A) + RNA was also isolated from each of the same elutriated NB4 cell fractions that were used to isolate proteins and analyzed by an RNA-Seq transcriptomics workflow (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This allowed us to quantitate transcripts from 12,078 protein coding genes, including 9667 genes whose mRNA expression was measured separately in each of the three pooled, elutriated fractions and in asynchronous cells."

This meta-analysis included protein data from 14 cell line proteomes: 3 \u00d7 HeLa, 2 \u00d7 U2OS, A549, GAMG, HEK293, K562, LnCap, MCF7, RKO, HepG2, and Jurkat-T (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lundberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Beck et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Nagaraj et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Geiger et al., 2012</a>), which were consolidated and mapped to Ensembl Genes prior to comparison. The combined data set provides evidence of protein-level expression of over 11,000 human genes. Of these, a common set of \u223c3000 genes are identified by protein data from all these cell lines, defining a core, shared proteome (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Interestingly, the abundance values of proteins in this core proteome span the full abundance range of the entire NB4 proteome. This suggests that the core proteome is not simply reflecting a detection bias towards abundant proteins. The core proteome is enriched in proteins associated with RNA processing, translation, cell cycle, and DNA metabolic processes, which together highlight key biological processes required for cell proliferation. In contrast, analysis of cell type-specific proteomes highlight specialized biological functions that are associated with cell lineage and mode of culture, as will be discussed below."

Comparison of these cell line-specific subproteomes reveals proteins with functions that highlight not only the differences in lineage, but also distinguish mode of culture, for example suspension vs adherent culture. For example, HeLa- and MCF7-specific sets are enriched in genes involved in cell adhesion, such as cadherins and integrins, whereas the Jurkat-T-specific set is enriched in genes involved in T-cell selection and activation, such as CD1, CD3, and CD4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

For example, in the category with proteins whose abundance peaks in S phase, there is a clear enrichment for GO terms associated with DNA metabolic functions, reflecting DNA replication as the major metabolic event in S phase. Additionally, the promoters of genes encoding proteins that peak in S-phase are enriched with respect to predicted binding sites for E2F (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), a transcription factor that is known to play major roles in regulating entry into the cell cycle and the G1\u2013S transition (<a href=\"#bib52\">Mudryj et al., 1991</a>). Interestingly, we identify members of the E2F family (E2F6 and E2F8) as proteins whose abundance peaks in S and G2&amp;M; phases, which is consistent with recent reports documenting their role in transcriptional inactivation of G1/S genes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bertoli et al., 2013</a>)."

An important point is that simply aggregating the peptide intensities for all of these CASC4 isoforms produces a relatively constant expression pattern across the elutriated fractions.

As shown with CASC4 above, aggregated peptide data for all isoforms of SDCCAG8 would indicate constant expression across the elutriated fractions, if interpreted as having all of the peptides belonging to a single protein species. However, as a result of the high sequence coverage obtained, it is apparent that the peptides from the SDCCAG8 gene belong to separate isoforms that are differentially regulated across the cell cycle. These three examples underline the value of high peptide sequence coverage that allows isoform-level resolution. The data also indicate that current analyzes likely underestimate the total number of cell cycle-regulated polypeptides, because with current methods many peptides are not detected and thus many isoforms still cannot be reliably discriminated."

Mechanistically, these patterns result from the combined effects of differential transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation of gene expression across the cell cycle. Highly concerted protein and mRNA expression levels will typically result from synergistic transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Several genes have been previously found to show highly correlated protein and mRNA expression across the cell cycle, including A-type cyclins. Consistent with previous work in other systems (<a href=\"#bib65\">Pines and Hunter, 1990</a>), we find that Cyclin A2 protein and mRNA expression is highly correlated in NB4 cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>, top). Detailed analyzes have documented regulatory mechanisms that underlie this correlation: namely, cell cycle-regulated transcription of the cyclin A gene, with cyclin A mRNA synthesis being highest in S and G2 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Henglein et al., 1994</a>), and destabilization of cyclin A mRNA and protein during early mitosis and G1 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Pines and Hunter, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Glotzer et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Henglein et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dawson et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Sudakin et al., 1995</a>). These synergistic regulatory mechanisms result in differential expression of the cyclin A gene across the cell cycle. Nearly half of the cell cycle-regulated proteins identified in our proteomic data set showed moderate to high correlation (r &gt; 0.5) between protein and mRNA expression patterns (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>).

Cdt1 mRNA abundance peaks in S-phase, where Cdt1 protein expression is lowest. This surprising inverse relationship between protein and mRNA levels is not likely to be due to low data quality for the Cdt1 gene. A high correlation (&gt;0.75) is observed among the eight, independently identified peptides used to quantify Cdt1 protein expression and error bars indicate the relatively low standard error in scaled intensities from the eight supporting peptides. Furthermore, the Cdt1 protein expression pattern across the cell cycle is confirmed by immunoblot analyzes of elutriated NB4 cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>), and is consistent with what is known in other cell types (<a href=\"#bib89\">Wohlschlegel et al., 2000</a>). Similarly, the Cdt1 mRNA expression pattern is reproducibly detected, as indicated by the error bars for mRNA quantitation and is consistent with recent reports showing that Cdt1 mRNA levels are high in S-phase due to positive regulation by geminin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ballabeni et al., 2013</a>)."

In contrast, GAPDH does not vary in abundance across the elutriated lysates. Thus, the MS and immunoblot data both show that ARHGAP11A is a cell cycle-regulated protein whose expression peaks in G2&amp;M; and is lowest in G1."

The APC/C is a multimeric protein complex whose activity and specificity is cell cycle regulated by interactions with co-activating factors Cdh1 and Cdc20 (<a href=\"#bib82\">Visintin et al., 1997</a>). Intriguingly, Cdc20 was among the 31 genes identified as being regulated both at the protein and mRNA level (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Disruption of the APC/C complex, for example by siRNA-mediated depletion of Cdh1 and/or Cdc20, is expected to stabilize substrate levels.

More importantly, disruption of APC/C activity in U2OS cells increases levels of ARHGAP11A (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). Similarly, transient depletion of Cdh1 in RPE-1 cells resulted in stabilization of the ARHGAP11A protein in asynchronous cells (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). G1-arrest by serum starvation results in very low levels of ARHGAP11A. Transient depletion of Cdh1 results in stabilization of ARHGAP11A, thus showing that ARHGAP11A levels are APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>-dependent during G1-phase (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>, lanes 3 and 4). The blots were also probed with anti-cyclin B1 antibodies to confirm disruption of APC/C activity (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). These data independently show that ARHGAP11A levels are lower in G1-phase than in asynchronous RPE-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>, lanes 1 and 3), which is consistent with the cell cycle regulation of ARHGAP11A abundance observed in elutriated NB4 cells. Thus, we conclude that ARHGAP11A is a cell cycle-regulated protein, and that its levels are regulated by targeted degradation mediated by the APC/C."

In previous studies, this is usually done using either chemical inhibitors or genetic depletion of essential factors, to either activate checkpoints or otherwise block progression through the cell cycle, thus allowing a large enough population of cells at the same cell cycle stage to be harvested for subsequent biochemical analysis. Although effective, the potential disadvantage of these approaches is that they inevitably cause a major metabolic perturbation and/or stress to achieve the cell cycle block and this in turn may affect gene expression in ways that would not occur during normal cell cycle progression. In addition, to minimize possible effects of specialized media on the normal cell cycle, we also avoided here using cell media with dialyzed serum, as frequently used for metabolic labeling of cells with heavy isotope substituted amino acids. Consequently, we focused on growing cells in normal sera and identified proteins by performing label-free MS analysis and we used centrifugal elutriation as the method to generate sub-populations of cells enriched at different cell cycle stages."

Compared with using metabolic inhibition to block cells at different cell cycle stages, elutriation generates minimal stress or disruption of cellular metabolism and physiology. We confirmed that here by showing that the elutriated NB4 cells remained viable and continued to grow and proliferate when returned to culture post elutriation without showing evidence of changes in morphology.

Differences between studies performed in HeLa and NB4 cells may also reflect tissue-specific and/or cell line-specific plasticity in cell cycle regulation in mammalian systems."

The results showed that this relationship is remarkably complex and clearly indicate that measurements of mRNA levels alone cannot be relied upon to provide an accurate reflection of protein abundance in many situations. Indeed, as illustrated for the Cdt1 gene, we identify examples where protein and mRNA levels are even inversely correlated. The rather complex relationship we observe between protein and mRNA levels is important for interpreting previous studies that have relied on using either microarray or RNA-Seq data alone as a surrogate for reporting on the regulation of protein expression."

However, this correlation is weaker (0.47) for the \u223c5% of genes encoding proteins whose abundance varies across the cell cycle. Interestingly, this subset of cell cycle-regulated genes shows further heterogeneity in the relationship between protein and mRNA abundance levels when examined more closely to compare the separate clusters of genes encoding proteins whose expression peaks at different stages. Thus, we observe dramatically varying correlations in protein/mRNA abundance levels in different clusters (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

This suggests that transcriptional regulation mechanisms contribute significantly to modulating protein expression levels in these phases, but less so in G1. A likely explanation for this observation, consistent with the literature on cell cycle regulatory mechanisms, is that post-transcriptional controls, including targeted protein degradation and regulation of translation, operate differentially across the cell cycle and cause temporal imbalances in the relation between transcript levels and proteins. It is well known that mechanisms exist for controlling the targeted degradation of specific proteins, for example, based on the substrate-specific action of E3 ligases targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib36\">King et al., 1996</a>)."

This also showed that aggregating all of the peptide information and interpreting it in terms of the behavior of a single hypothetical polypeptide, as typically done in proteomic studies, would lead to an incorrect conclusion that the corresponding gene was not subject to cell cycle regulation because the peptide information for the cell cycle-regulated isoform was diluted by the contribution of the peptides shared with the other, unregulated isoforms encoded by the same gene."

Our data therefore highlight the need for further technological development in proteomics methods and instrumentation because even in the deepest analyzes reported to date, as with this present study, still less than 50% of the total protein sequence is identified for the genes we can detect being expressed at the protein level. It is also difficult to detect multiple peptides consistently across every sample in a complex experiment, as is the case here with multiple elutriated cell populations.

This version of MaxQuant includes an integrated search engine, Andromeda (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cox et al., 2011</a>). The database supplied to the search engine for peptide identifications was a UniProt human protein database (\u2018Human Reference Proteome\u2019 retrieved on 19 August 2012) combined with a commonly observed contaminants list. The initial mass tolerance was set to 7 p.p.m. and MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.5 Da. Enzyme was set to trypsin/P with up to 2 missed cleavages. Deamidation, oxidation of methionine and Gln-&gt;pyro-Glu were searched as variable modifications. Identification was set to a false discovery rate of 1%. To achieve reliable identifications, all proteins were accepted based on the criteria that the number of forward hits in the database was at least 100-fold higher than the number of reverse database hits, thus resulting in a false discovery rate of less than 1%. Protein isoforms and proteins that cannot be distinguished based on the peptides identified are grouped by MaxQuant and displayed on a single line with multiple UniProt identifiers. The label free quantitation (LFQ) algorithm in MaxQuant was used for protein quantitation. The algorithm has been previously described (<a href=\"#bib44\">Luber et al., 2010</a>). The MaxQuant data analysis was repeated with searches for the following post-translational modifications: Phospho(STY), Methyl/Di-Methyl (KR), and Acetyl (K). Protein quantitation was performed on unmodified peptides and peptides that have modifications that are known to occur during sample processing (pyro-Glu, deamidation).

An initial cleaning step was performed to improve the quality and value of the data set. This step involved removing proteins with less than 2 peptide identifications, those labeled as either contaminants or reverse hits and those where data were missing in any of the fractions. Proteins were further filtered using a procedure analogous to a \u2018checksum\u2019 function in computing. An algorithm was constructed to assess the self-consistency of the quantitation based on known relationships between the elutriated fractions. The intensities measured in the asynchronous NB4 cell population can thus be modeled as a linear combination of the intensities originating from the six elutriated fractions that have been normalized by the measured cell count in each elutriated fraction. For each protein, the theoretical linear combination of elutriated fraction intensities (scaled by cell number) should match the protein intensity measured experimentally in the asynchronous population. Similar factors were calculated between adjacent fractions (e.g., F1 vs F2), using cell number and the proportions of cells in each phase, as determined by flow cytometry. These stringent criteria left a subset of the total proteins detected with very high data coverage across the six elutriated cell cycle fractions and high self-consistency in quantitation."

The authors have used elutriation to enrich for specific cell cycle phases thereby obviating the need to activate cell cycle checkpoints to synchronise cells. The authors make a number of observations, some of which are novel and others generalize principles that have already been observed in the characterization of individual cell cycle regulators. The mass spectrometry analysis is very comprehensive and represents probably the most thorough analysis of protein levels through the cell cycle to date. In addition, this is the first study to compare the mRNA to protein levels through the cell cycle and they find, as largely expected from what we know of protein regulation by proteolysis in the cell cycle, that mRNA levels poorly predict protein levels."

The second is the analysis of the results, which requires very substantial revision. The paper has the peculiar appearance of being written in isolation from the cell cycle literature. A number of the proteins selected as examples by the authors have been extensively analysed in other studies, but these are not referenced. For example, the authors focus on cyclin A2 and by comparing its mRNA level to protein level they conclude that transcription is a major factor in regulating cyclin A levels. They make no mention of the considerable work that has been done on cyclin A in human cells, which has shown that it is an E2F target whose transcription starts at the end of G1 phase, and is targeted by the APC/C ubiquitin ligase in early mitosis and G1 phase. Thus, it is the combination of transcriptional control and cell cycle-dependent proteolysis that controls cyclin A levels. The authors are similarly na\u00efve in their conclusion that protein levels are poorly correlated with mRNA levels; the extensive studies in the last 20 years on SCF-dependent and APC/C-dependent proteolysis is basically ignored with the primary references here being papers from the mid 1990's. Similarly, the authors appear not to have realized that because \u223c50% of the population of asynchronous cells are in G1 phase, mRNA levels in asynchronous cells will be poorly predictive of protein level for any protein whose transcription or stability is cell cycle regulated."

The second is the analysis of the results, which requires very substantial revision. The paper has the peculiar appearance of being written in isolation from the cell cycle literature. A number of the proteins selected as examples by the authors have been extensively analysed in other studies, but these are not referenced. For example, the authors focus on cyclin A2 and by comparing its mRNA level to protein level they conclude that transcription is a major factor in regulating cyclin A levels. They make no mention of the considerable work that has been done on cyclin A in human cells, which has shown that it is an E2F target whose transcription starts at the end of G1 phase, and is targeted by the APC/C ubiquitin ligase in early mitosis and G1 phase. Thus, it is the combination of transcriptional control and cell cycle-dependent proteolysis that controls cyclin A levels</i>."

As this study, so far as we know, provides the most comprehensive global analysis of cell cycle regulated gene expression to date, at both the protein and mRNA level (and the only one we know of in myeloid cells), our finding that the relationship between protein and mRNA levels is highly complex and gene\u2010specific is novel. We are not aware of any comparable, prior analyses that would allow this conclusion to be drawn. While it is true that for certain specific genes, as previously described, protein and mRNA levels are highly correlated due to synergistic transcriptional activation and targeted degradation (such as cyclin A), we specifically show that there are many other cell cycle regulated genes where protein and mRNA levels are very poorly correlated and in some cases even anti\u2010correlated. It is therefore not the case that the prior literature had already comprehensively described how cell cycle affects gene expression at the protein and mRNA level and also not the case that all, or even most, cell cycle regulated genes are regulated in the same way. This in itself we feel is a rather interesting result."

These data therefore do not fit with the statement from the reviewers that \u201cmRNA levels in asynchronous cells will be poorly predictive of protein level for any protein whose transcription or stability is cell cycle regulated\u201d. The clear implication of this statement is that cell cycle regulated genes are either modulated by transcriptional, or stability, mechanisms and therefore it should be apparent that they will inevitably show a poorer than average correlation between protein and mRNA levels. Instead, however, our data show that for certain cell cycle regulated genes, mRNA and protein levels are more correlated in asynchronous cells than seen for bulk gene expression. We hope that these results will thus be of general interest to the cell biology community and can serve to stimulate further research into the mechanisms of gene expression and how it contributes to cell cycle regulation."

While we of course agree that in general more replicate data sets enhance the estimation of variance, we disagree with the notion that whether data are deemed either quantitative or qualitative is simply a reflection of the number of replicates performed. For example, a poorly designed experiment, with low quality data, would not be very \u2018quantitative\u2019, even with 3 or more replicates! We note that in our deep proteome analysis, even although it corresponds to one very large amalgamated experiment (and can thus be viewed as a single replicate), multiple internal replications help to mitigate noise in the data and to improve the accuracy of quantitation. This includes the fact that the separate proteomic measurements of the different elutriated fractions actually represent multiple technical replicates within the experiment. Furthermore, the filtered dataset we used to identify cell cycle regulated proteins had, on average, 22 independent, quantitative peptide measurements to support the final quantitation value presented for each protein. Thus, we strongly assert that this study is, by any reasonable definition, \u201cquantitative\u201d and allows quantitative conclusions to be drawn, albeit with the usual limitations affecting all quantitative studies. In this case the scale of the deep proteome experiment and huge volume of instrument and analysis time involved simply precludes it being done with many biological replicates, given current technology. However, we do not wish this partly semantic point as to how quantitative the data are to be contentious. Therefore, as a compromise, we changed the title from \u201cA quantitative chronology...\u201d to \u201cA proteomic chronology....\u201d, while retaining the descriptor \u201cquantitative\u201d in the abstract and the text.

However, we believe the concern raised by the reviewers is not in fact valid because the elutriated fractions are only enriched for cells at different cell cycle stages and not completely pure, (as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Therefore, our analysis does not necessarily exclude detection of proteins that are specifically induced only at defined cell cycle stages. Even if their regulation was so strict that they were completely absent in one or more stages, rather than simply modulated in abundance, they should likely still be present at some level and hence in theory be detectable in each of the elutriated fractions because these contain mixed populations. Our decision to enforce only considering proteins where data were detected across all fractions is deliberately conservative and we accept this reduces the total number of proteins we evaluate for cell cycle regulation. On the positive side, this decision to be conservative improves the overall quality and quantitative value (see comments also above) of our data set, reduces false positives and ensures that we include predominantly proteins that are comfortably above the sensitivity threshold for our technical workflow."

Thus, while STAT3 is likely to be important for regulating specific genes, our data suggest that on the whole, other transcription factors (such as E2F in S\u2010phase), are predominantly responsible for general transcriptional regulation of cell cycle gene expression in G1\u2010 and S\u2010phase. However, STAT3 appears to be generally important in regulating the transcription of proteins that peak in G2/M/G1, with nearly all members of this cluster having predicted STAT3 binding sites in their promoters.

To a large extent this is an inevitable corollary of aiming to document global gene expression dynamics across such a complex biological process as the cell cycle. We are especially pleased that <i>eLife</i> provides a unique opportunity to include a comprehensive treatment of the data that would definitely not be possible in the standard high profile journals. To keep the length of the manuscript within reasonable limits, we have however revised the manuscript to try to be as concise as possible, commensurate with the scale and scope of the dataset."

We understood this to be the desired layout in an <i>eLife</i> publication. These figures, labelled \u201cFigure X\u2013supplementary figure Y\u201d, are to be hyperlinked from the main figure when viewed online, thus providing readers convenient access to supplementary figures. We apologize that this was not made clear in the original file containing the figures and wonder if this contributed to giving the impression that the manuscript was longer than it will actually appear."
