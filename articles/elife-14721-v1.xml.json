Several of the most deadly bacterial pathogens, such as <i>Salmonella enterica</i> and <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, cause disease by multiplying inside human cells. The human body is constantly patrolled by immune cells, and contains lots of antibodies and other molecules that can target and kill microbes, but the environment inside host cells provides a safe haven where certain pathogens can avoid detection by the immune system. However, each host cell can contain only a limited number of these intracellular bacteria so, after several rounds of replication, they need to leave the infected cell and invade other cells in order to continue multiplying. Until recently the details of how intracellular bacteria can spread between cells without being detected and killed by the immune system were poorly understood."

Previous studies have revealed that some intracellular bacteria, including <i>L. monocytogenes,</i> grow an actin tail in order to move between epithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Welch and Way, 2013</a>). However, <i>F. tularensis</i> is unable to form an actin tail so it must rely on a different mechanism to spread around the body."

Top: After several rounds of replication in host cells, certain intracellular bacteria (green), including <i>L. monocytogenes,</i> have the ability to make an actin tail that can propel them from an infected cell (shown in blue) towards a neighbouring epithelial cell (yellow). This causes part of the infected cell membrane to bulge into the neighbouring cell, which eventually results in the bacteria being taken into the neighbouring cell surrounded by two layers of membrane (one from each cell). Bacteria then break down the two membranes to be released into the cytosol. Bottom: Steele et al. found that <i>F. tularensis</i> and <i>S. enterica</i> can transfer between macrophages through a trogocytosis-associated process. Uninfected macrophages (yellow) acquire bacteria from infected macrophages (blue) following temporary contact between the cells. Afterwards, the cells separate and the bacteria start to replicate in the acceptor cell (blue-yellow; the original blue donor cell is not shown). This bacterial cell-to-cell transfer is also associated with the exchange of membrane, membrane proteins and cytosol."

It\u00a0happens more often upon infection, specifically between infected macrophages and their donor cells. This observation suggests that trogocytosis is regulated by individual cells upon infection. A remarkable feature of this process is that membrane proteins that are exchanged between cells \u2013 such as the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules, which help to activate immune responses \u2013 continue to work properly in their new cell. Therefore, trogocytosis may serve as a surveillance mechanism for the immune system."

This task will be particularly challenging since it is not currently possible to block trogocytosis with genetic techniques or specific inhibitor drugs. Further experiments are needed to visualize the cellular structures involved in the process, and to understand how the transfer of bacteria is regulated. It will also be important to understand the impact of trogocytosis-associated transfer on other processes, notably innate immune signaling (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ablasser et al., 2013</a>), the presentation of antigens (including the possible transfer of the MHC between cells; <a href=\"#bib2\">Campana et al., 2015</a>), and the spread of the bacteria within the host."
