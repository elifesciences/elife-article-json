However, network-level mechanisms that link its activity to brain state remain enigmatic. Here, we combined optogenetics, fMRI, electrophysiology, and video-EEG monitoring to characterize the central thalamus-driven global brain networks responsible for switching brain state. 40 and 100 Hz stimulations of central thalamus caused widespread activation of forebrain, including frontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and striatum, and transitioned the brain to a state of arousal in asleep rats. In contrast, 10 Hz stimulation evoked significantly less activation of forebrain, inhibition of sensory cortex, and behavioral arrest. To investigate possible mechanisms underlying the frequency-dependent cortical inhibition, we performed recordings in zona incerta, where 10, but not 40, Hz stimulation evoked spindle-like oscillations. Importantly, suppressing incertal activity during 10 Hz central thalamus stimulation reduced the evoked cortical inhibition. These findings identify key brain-wide dynamics underlying central thalamus arousal regulation."

However, network-level mechanisms that link its activity to brain state remain enigmatic. Here, we combined optogenetics, fMRI, electrophysiology, and video-EEG monitoring to characterize the central thalamus-driven global brain networks responsible for switching brain state. 40 and 100 Hz stimulations of central thalamus caused widespread activation of forebrain, including frontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and striatum, and transitioned the brain to a state of arousal in asleep rats. In contrast, 10 Hz stimulation evoked significantly less activation of forebrain, inhibition of sensory cortex, and behavioral arrest. To investigate possible mechanisms underlying the frequency-dependent cortical inhibition, we performed recordings in zona incerta, where 10, but not 40, Hz stimulation evoked spindle-like oscillations. Importantly, suppressing incertal activity during 10 Hz central thalamus stimulation reduced the evoked cortical inhibition. These findings identify key brain-wide dynamics underlying central thalamus arousal regulation."

The central thalamus and intralaminar nuclei, in particular, have been postulated to play a critical and unique function in regulating arousal, attention, and goal-directed behavior (<a href=\"#bib78\">Schiff and Pfaff, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Mair et al., 2011</a>). This idea dates back to the first demonstrations that direct and indirect electrical stimulations of central thalamus control cortical electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics and elicit behavioral transitions between drowsiness/relaxation and wakefulness/attention (<a href=\"#bib68\">Moruzzi and Magoun, 1949</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Hunter and Jasper, 1949</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Fuster, 1958</a>). Since the initial identification of central thalamus\u2019s causal effect on brain state and behavior, significant support for its role in arousal regulation has come from anatomical and histological studies. Steriade and Glenn (<a href=\"#bib95\">Steriade and Glenn, 1982</a>) identified a monosynaptic pathway from the mesencephalic reticular formation to the central lateral (CL) and paracentral (PC) nuclei of central thalamus that projects to cerebral cortex and striatum. In addition to this input, the central thalamus receives projections from other arousal systems, including norepinephrinergic innervation from locus coeruleus (<a href=\"#bib104\">Vogt et al., 2008</a>) and cholinergic innervation from the upper brainstem and basal forebrain (<a href=\"#bib38\">Heckers et al., 1992</a>). In combination with these inputs, the diffuse projections of central thalamus allow it to influence the overall excitability of cortex during states of attention. For example, virtually all relay cells of the CL nucleus project to both striatum and cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#bib23\">Deschenes et al., 1996</a>)."

First, variations in the level of activity within the intralaminar nuclei are linked to changes in behavioral alertness (<a href=\"#bib50\">Kinomura et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Shirvalkar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Mair and Hembrook, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Schiff et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Giber et al., 2015</a>), including transitions during the normal sleep\u2013wake cycle and acute cognitive enhancements such as improved working-memory and sustained attention (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, lesions of the central thalamus can produce enduring cognitive impairments, including reduced attentional processing and memory (<a href=\"#bib36\">Guberman and Stuss, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Mair et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Van Der Werf et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Newman and Burk, 2005</a>), hypersomnolence (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bassetti et al., 1996</a>), or even coma (<a href=\"#bib12\">Castaigne et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Plum, 1991</a>). Indeed, neuronal loss across central thalamus has been associated with severely disabled and vegetative patients following severe traumatic brain injury (<a href=\"#bib63\">Maxwell et al., 2006</a>). In addition, electrical stimulation of the central thalamus at low frequencies is associated with absence seizures and behavioral arrest in animal models (<a href=\"#bib43\">Hunter and Jasper, 1949</a>) and human subjects (<a href=\"#bib103\">Velasco, 1996</a>). Human imaging studies have also found that anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness is associated with disrupted thalamocortical functional connectivity in regions consistent with the intralaminar nuclei (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akeju, 2014</a>)."

This GABAergic population is itself inhibited by the striatal neurons driven by central thalamus, creating a positive feedback loop. Thus, when the thalamostriatal and thalamocortical projections from central thalamus are partially lost due to brain injury, it causes disinhibition of the pallidum and increased inhibition of the remaining central thalamus neurons, which further reduces cortical activation. While this down-regulation is predicted to have broad modulatory impact on global dynamics, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of central thalamus has been explored as a potential means of reversing its effects and facilitating arousal regulation in the minimally conscious state (<a href=\"#bib88\">Shirvalkar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Schiff et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Mair and Hembrook, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Smith et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Mair et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Schiff, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Fridman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Gummadavelli et al., 2015</a>). Despite success in a single-subject clinical study (<a href=\"#bib77\">Schiff et al., 2007</a>), identification of circuit-level mechanisms that link therapeutic efficacy of central thalamus DBS to specific stimulation parameters remains challenging and at present limits the clinical efficacy of DBS in subjects with traumatic brain injury. Thus, while significant progress has been made in understanding the connections of central thalamus and its behavioral correlates (<a href=\"#bib101\">Van der Werf et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Schiff, 2008</a>), relatively little is known about the dynamic function of these circuits, and no clear mechanism exists to explain how \u2013 or indeed, if \u2013 a single population in central thalamus can act as a switch on the global brain state."

The combination of optogenetic stimulation with fMRI (ofMRI) has been demonstrated to be an effective method for mapping the functional role of specific genetically- and spatially-defined neuronal populations at various brain regions and different frequencies of stimulation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lee et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Desai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Weitz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Liang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Takata et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Duffy et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Byers et al., 2015</a>). In the present work, we sought to apply this approach to uncover the downstream effects of distinct firing patterns by central thalamus relay cells at the whole-brain level \u2013 a visualization uniquely possible with ofMRI. Prior work beginning with Morison and Dempsey (<a href=\"#bib67\">Morison and Dempsey, 1942</a>), who envisioned \u201cdissecting\u2026 the electrical activity of the cortex on the basis of its relations with the thalamus,\u201d has shown that high- and low-frequency electrical stimulation of thalamic nuclei can produce distinct cortical activation patterns. For example, early studies of the intralaminar nuclei per se showed that low-frequency stimulation evokes slow-wave activity and spindle bursts in cortical EEG, which are associated with primary generalized absence seizures, loss of consciousness, and drowsiness (<a href=\"#bib43\">Hunter and Jasper, 1949</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Jasper, 1949</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Seidenbecher and Pape, 2001</a>). Conversely, high-frequency electrical stimulation has been shown to desynchronize the cortical EEG signal (<a href=\"#bib68\">Moruzzi and Magoun, 1949</a>), which is associated with behavioral arousal. While these studies set early hypotheses on the mechanisms of arousal regulation, the non-selective nature of electrical stimulation has prevented the observed responses from being attributed specifically to relay cells, and not synaptic afferents or fibers of passage mixing together in a bulk activation effect. More importantly, although a picture of whole brain activity can be vaguely inferred from electrophysiology recordings, these techniques cannot provide a direct visualization of activity across individual brain regions over the entire brain. Because ofMRI can provide spatial and temporal information on the whole-brain scale during perturbations of specific neural circuitry, we applied this technique to study the causal role of central thalamus relay neurons in activating forebrain networks."

The ZI, a mostly GABAergic region, has been shown to limit the transmission of ascending sensory information via feedforward inhibition of higher\u00a0order thalamic nuclei (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barth\u00f3 et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Trageser and Keller, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lavall\u00e9e et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Trageser et al., 2006</a>). Such activity can induce a state of reduced sensory processing, similar to the behavioral quiescence induced by low-frequency central thalamus stimulation. These studies suggest a powerful control exerted by ZI over brain state and higher\u00a0level processing, much like central thalamus. However, the possible involvement of ZI in central thalamus arousal circuits remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the electrophysiology responses of this region during targeted stimulation of central thalamus at frequencies that either facilitate or suppress attention and arousal. To determine whether ZI plays an active role in these circuits, we also used optogenetics to specifically inhibit neurons in this region during central thalamus stimulation. This experimental paradigm was used to infer ZI\u2019s functional contribution to the central thalamus-driven brain circuit dynamics measured with fMRI and electrophysiology."

We performed a stereotactic injection in the right CL and PC intralaminar nuclei of central thalamus with adeno-associated virus carrying channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and the fluorescent reporter protein EYFP under control of the CaMKIIa promoter. This promoter is expressed primarily in excitatory neurons, the vast majority of which in thalamus are relay cells (<a href=\"#bib93\">Smith, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ellender et al., 2013</a>). Of cells identified within the bulk injection area, 35% were EYFP-positive, and 97% of EYFP-positive cells co-expressed CaMKIIa, indicating high sensitivity for stimulation of excitatory neurons (n = 2 rats, 831 cells; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While ChR2-EYFP expression extended beyond these two nuclei (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), targeted stimulation of the intralaminar nuclei was achieved by (a) stereotactic placement of the implanted optical fiber, as confirmed with high-resolution T2-weighted structural MR images (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), and (b) spatially restricted illumination (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). We initially injected and cannulated 47 rats using the central thalamus as the stereotactic target (-3.2 mm AP, +1.5 mm ML, -5.5 mm DV). However, the intralaminar nuclei are relatively small and difficult to accurately target. We therefore used only a subset of these animals based on the empirically observed distribution of optical fiber tip locations using T2-weighted MRI scans (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; &lt;0.85 mm distance from target coordinate). Of the 18 rats that had an accurately localized implant location, two exhibited a general absence of fMRI activity \u2013 most notably at the site of stimulation \u2013 and were excluded, leaving 16 animals for further analysis."

Due to the spread of viral transfection (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), it is possible that the reported fluorescence reflects projections from adjacent thalamic nuclei as well. Nevertheless, in agreement with known projection systems of central thalamus, EYFP-expressing axons were observed throughout forebrain, including frontal cortex and striatum (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In particular, the medial prefrontal, lateral prefrontal, cingulate, motor, and sensory cortices all received strong projections. This input was highly convergent at the superficial layers, with moderate but weaker projections present in middle layers as well. Furthermore, projections were significantly restricted to the hemisphere ipsilateral to virus injection for both cortex and striatum. While these anatomical connections provide a strong foundation for understanding how central thalamus can influence brain state, they do little to explain the dynamic nature of these circuits \u2013 for example, how stimulation of central thalamus at different frequencies can lead to distinct behavioral responses (<a href=\"#bib43\">Hunter and Jasper, 1949</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Velasco, 1996</a>). Therefore, to dissect the functional significance of these massive forebrain projections and visualize the large-scale spatial and temporal dynamics evoked by central thalamus stimulation, we combined optical stimulation with simultaneous in vivo whole-brain functional imaging (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lee et al., 2010</a>)."

Novel inverse Gauss-Newton methods were also used to correct for possible motion artifacts and optimize the robustness of detecting optogenetically\u00a0evoked responses (<a href=\"#bib29\">Fang and Lee, 2013</a>). For each experiment, we delivered 20\u2009s periods of stimulation every minute for 6 min at 10, 40, or 100\u2009Hz. This form of continuous steady-state stimulation mimics the approach used in clinical DBS and has been showed to evoke robust fMRI responses with optogenetic stimuli (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lee, et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Duffy, et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib105\">Weitz et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, stimulation at all three frequencies resulted in a robust positive blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal at the site of stimulation that was highly synchronized to light delivery, increased upon optical activation, and gradually returned to baseline following the end of stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). To confirm that this BOLD signal reflected underlying neuronal firing patterns, we next performed simultaneous single-unit recordings with stimulation using an optrode at the central thalamus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In agreement with the fMRI signal, stimulations at 10, 40, and 100\u2009Hz all resulted in robust increases in the local neuronal firing rate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G;</a> n = 5 neurons, p&lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the 20\u2009s pre-stimulation and stimulation periods, 12 trials for each neuron)."

For example, the evoked responses are consistent with the unilateral nature of thalamocortical projections (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but reveal that the contralateral cortex can still be modulated by unilateral stimulation of central thalamus, particularly at high frequencies. Importantly, stimulation of other thalamic nuclei failed to evoke similarly widespread activity in the striatum and cortex (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Furthermore, large differences in forebrain activation between 10 and 40\u2009Hz stimulations were not observed for other forms of subcortical stimulation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), suggesting this is a distinct property of central thalamus."

Because we wished to keep a 20\u2009s pulse train for all stimulation frequencies and avoid possible differences introduced by neuronal adaptation, maintaining a constant duty cycle required unique pulse widths for each frequency (i.e. 30, 7.5, and 3 ms for 10, 40, and 100\u2009Hz, respectively). To rule out the possibility that these changes in pulse width were the primary cause of the above differences in forebrain recruitment, we repeated stimulations while maintaining a 3 ms pulse width. Visualization and quantification of evoked fMRI responses show that the increase in cortical and striatal activation with frequency was preserved (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). These data suggest that stimulation frequency was the primary factor in modulating forebrain fMRI activation."

Despite targeted activation of excitatory neurons, the somatosensory cortex exhibited a strong negative BOLD signal during 10\u2009Hz stimulation, suggesting a suppression of baseline activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3A,B</a>). In stark contrast, central thalamus stimulations at 40 and 100\u2009Hz led to positive changes in the BOLD signal at the somatosensory cortex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3A,B</a>). Thus, stimulation of the same excitatory population at different frequencies resulted in completely opposite responses at a downstream target. Importantly, these responses were preserved when pulse width was held constant in control experiments, indicating that stimulation frequency was the primary factor controlling this effect (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A,C</a>)."

                                "text": "While previous studies have hinted at similar findings of frequency-dependent polarity changes (<a href=\"#bib57\">Logothetis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Weitz et al., 2015</a>), downstream positive and negative BOLD signals that result from selective stimulation of excitatory neurons at distinct frequencies have not yet been visualized and validated with electrophysiology. To define the neuronal underpinnings of these signals, we therefore performed single-unit extracellular recordings in the somatosensory cortex during central thalamus stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In agreement with the BOLD activity observed during ofMRI experiments, 10\u2009Hz stimulation resulted in a decrease in neuronal firing rate between pre-stimulation and stimulation periods (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>; n = 10 of 11 recorded neurons). Conversely, stimulations at 40 and 100\u2009Hz both led to increases in neuronal firing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>; n = 11 of 11 recorded neurons). Because the evoked firing rates appeared to change over the course of stimulation, we specifically compared the pre-stimulation firing rate to the average firing rates during consecutive 5\u2009s periods of the 20\u2009s stimulus (i.e. 0\u20135\u2009s, 5\u201310\u2009s, 10\u201315\u2009s, and 15\u201320\u2009s; uncorrected p\u00a0&lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test; 17 trials for each neuron). Interestingly, the decrease in firing rate during 10\u2009Hz stimulation occurred primarily over the interval from 5 to 15\u2009s after stimulation began, while the increase in firing rate during 40\u2009Hz stimulation occurred primarily over the first 10\u2009s (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). On the other hand, the increase in neuronal firing rate during 100\u2009Hz stimulation was generally maintained throughout the 20\u2009s stimulation period (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Such differences may reflect short-term plasticity of the thalamocortical pathway, which has previously been shown to exhibit frequency-dependent properties (<a href=\"#bib13\">Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1996a</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">1996b</a>). Peri-stimulus time histograms also revealed that spike events occurring during inhibition had a non-uniform distribution over time, which peaked between 6 and 34 ms after light onset (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data suggest that the glutamatergic thalamocortical input at 10\u2009Hz sometimes generated action potentials. Notably, however, not every light pulse resulted in an immediate action potential."

We chose to investigate the response properties of the ZI, which has been implicated in providing a powerful GABAergic modulation of 10\u2009Hz spike-wave activity in spontaneous absence seizures in the rat (<a href=\"#bib86\">Shaw et al., 2013</a>). Anatomically, ZI sends direct GABAergic projections to somatosensory thalamic nuclei and sensory cortex (<a href=\"#bib71\">Nicolelis et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Kolmac and Mitrofanis, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barth\u00f3 et al., 2002</a>). Functionally, ZI has also been shown to selectively gate sensory information processing in higher\u00a0order thalamic nuclei through GABAergic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib99\">Trageser and Keller, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lavall\u00e9e et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Trageser et al., 2006</a>). To investigate the involvement of ZI, we performed single-unit and field potential electrophysiology recordings in this region during simultaneous optogenetic stimulation of central thalamus at 10 or 40\u2009Hz (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). EEG recordings were simultaneously collected in frontal cortex to directly evaluate the relationship between ZI activity and whole-brain arousal state, which is typically measured with forebrain EEG. The ZI was targeted using stereotactic localization and the well-defined somatotopic representation of this region (<a href=\"#bib70\">Nicolelis et al., 1992</a>). The electrode was targeted to -3.96 mm AP, +2.2\u20132.6 mm ML, +6.7\u20137.2 mm DV from dura. The ZI was identified according to a compatible depth reading, spike latencies consistent with a polysynaptic response (on the order of 10 ms; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), and a receptive field that responds to contralateral whisker stimulation, which ZI is known to possess (<a href=\"#bib70\">Nicolelis et al., 1992</a>). The electrode was initially lowered through the dorsal part of the VP thalamus (approximately 1.5 mm above ZI), which also responds to whisker stimulation, until the recorded neurons did not respond to such a stimulus. The electrode was then lowered for another ~1.5 mm until the recorded neurons fired in response to whisker stimulation, indicating the ZI had been reached."

However, a key difference was that large, amplitude-modulated spindle-like oscillations (SLOs) in the field potential occurred significantly more often during 10\u2009Hz stimulation than 40\u2009Hz stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). These oscillations exhibited an inter-event interval centered around 6.6 \u00b1 0.2\u2009s (s.e.m.), similar to those observed in thalamus during sleep onset (<a href=\"#bib18\">Contreras et al., 1997</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Consistent with this, simultaneous EEG recordings in frontal cortex revealed strong spike-wave modulation during 10\u2009Hz stimulation and lower amplitude, fast oscillations during 40\u2009Hz stimulation, which are associated with loss of consciousness and aroused brain states, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). EYFP-expressing axons were also observed in ZI (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>), indicating that central thalamus relay neurons may have direct connections to ZI and providing a possible anatomical substrate for these responses."

However, it remains unknown whether the evoked activity in ZI plays a causal role in driving the frequency-dependent inhibition of somatosensory cortex. To address this question, we injected the inhibitory opsin halorhodopsin (eNpHR) fused to the mCherry fluorescent marker and controlled by the pan-neuronal hSyn promoter into ZI of four animals expressing ChR2-EYFP in central thalamus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Single-unit recordings were performed simultaneously at the ZI and sensory cortex during concurrent activation of these two opsins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

Consistent with the data presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, 68 cells (89%) exhibited a decrease in firing during 10\u2009Hz stimulation of central thalamus (uncorrected p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test; 10\u201315 trials for each neuron). Strikingly, however, suppression of ZI activity with eNpHR reversed this effect. Across animals, 50 out of 76 neurons (66%) exhibited reduced inhibition when central thalamus stimulation was paired with eNpHR activation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>; p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test over 1\u2009s bins; 10\u201320 trials for each neuron). Indeed, a fraction of cells switched from inhibitory responses to excitatory ones. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> illustrates the firing patterns of one cell that exhibited an inhibitory response during 10\u2009Hz central thalamus stimulation that was eliminated when ZI was simultaneously suppressed with eNpHR. Collectively, these data suggest that incertal activity during 10\u2009Hz central thalamus stimulation has a net inhibitory effect on somatosensory cortex. In support of this influence being through direct anatomical connections, mCherry-positive axons were observed in the sensory cortex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>), consistent with previous reports of incerto-cortical projections (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lin et al., 1990</a>). These findings present a conceptually novel role of ZI in central thalamus arousal circuits."

Control (pre-stimulus) activity was consistent across frequencies of stimulation, as quantified with EEG band power in delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). During 10\u2009Hz stimulation, the majority of animals exhibited behavior indicative of an absence seizure, including freezing and behavioral arrest throughout stimulation followed by a return to sleep (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; n = 4/7). In addition, the most common EEG response was a transition to slow spike-wave discharges (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>; n = 5/7), which are typically associated with loss of consciousness (<a href=\"#bib65\">Mirsky and VanBuren, 1965</a>).

More recently, it has also been shown that pharmacologically-induced changes in thalamic firing levels can switch cortical dynamics between activation and deactivation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hirata and Castro-Alamancos, 2010</a>). However, no studies have characterized the specific changes in activity that simultaneously occur across the whole intact brain during these events to explain how the same neuronal population can selectively switch arousal state. Here, we show that distinct firing patterns of excitatory neurons in the central thalamus drive these opposing EEG rhythms, lead to dramatic differences in the spatial extent of forebrain recruitment, and switch the region\u2019s downstream influence on cortex from excitation to inhibition. Notably, high-frequency EEG patterns evoked during 40 and 100\u2009Hz stimulation associate with robust activation of frontal cortex, motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and striatum \u2013 regions that receive widespread glutamatergic projections from intralaminar nuclei (<a href=\"#bib47\">Jones and Leavitt, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Berendse and Groenewegen, 1990</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib35\">Groenewegen and Berendse, 1994;</a> <a href=\"#bib92\">Smith et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</a>). On the other hand, slow-wave oscillations evoked during 10\u2009Hz stimulation are associated with limited forebrain activation and strong inhibition of somatosensory cortex. The frequency-dependent generation of spindle-like oscillations, which are known to underlie brain synchronization at the onset of sleep (<a href=\"#bib96\">Steriade et al., 1993</a>), suggest that these differences may in part be due to the engagement of thalamocortical networks responsible for sleep and loss of perceptual awareness during 10\u2009Hz stimulation. In the context of our findings, it is also noteworthy that for some rat strains with absence seizures, a specific 10\u2009Hz generator in somatosensory cortex has been independently proposed (<a href=\"#bib102\">van Luijtelaar and Sitnikova, 2006</a>)."

In this study, we investigated the behavior of ZI \u2013 a region rich in GABAergic neurons that also sends direct inhibitory projections to sensory thalamus and sensory cortex (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lin et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Benson et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Nicolelis et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Kolmac and Mitrofanis, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barth\u00f3 et al., 2002</a>). We found that spindle-like oscillations were uniquely evoked when central thalamus was stimulated at 10\u2009Hz and somatosensory cortex was inhibited. Stimulation at this frequency in asleep rats also evoked absence seizure-like freezing and spike-waves in a majority of animals, a cortical pattern known to be modulated by ZI projections (<a href=\"#bib86\">Shaw et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, suppressing the incertal activity evoked by 10\u2009Hz central thalamus stimulation with halorhodopsin reduced the cortical inhibition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>), suggesting a key role for ZI in modulating this response. Indeed, it has been previously suggested that rhythmic incertal activity contributes to membrane hyperpolarizations and sustained high-voltage cortical rhythms through GABAergic incertofugal pathways (<a href=\"#bib86\">Shaw et al., 2013</a>). Our data support this hypothesis, and link such a pathway to whole-brain, directly visualized fMRI activity patterns."

This incerto-thalamic pathway would parallel the previously reported gating of ascending sensory information at the level of thalamus by ZI (<a href=\"#bib99\">Trageser and Keller, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lavall\u00e9e et al., 2005</a>). The hypothesized feedforward and feedback inhibition via ZI both suggest a direct projection from central thalamus to ZI, which our fluorescence imaging data support (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). However, we note that previous tracing studies failed to identify thalamic input specifically from intralaminar nuclei to ZI (<a href=\"#bib85\">Shammah-Lagnado et al., 1985</a>). In summary, our findings provide the first demonstration that arousal regulation driven by central thalamus has a causal and frequency-dependent influence on ZI, and that suppressing the recruitment of ZI modulates the brain-wide dynamics driven by central thalamus stimulation. Specifically, our results suggest that the frequency-dependent depression of cortical activity is in part mediated by extrinsic inhibitory signals originating from ZI."

Low-frequency (10\u2009Hz) stimulations of certain thalamic nuclei in vivo yield strong hyperpolarization of cortical neurons putatively via this process (<a href=\"#bib13\">Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1996a</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">1996c</a>). It is also interesting to note that the \u2018recruiting response\u2019, characterized by an enhanced cortical response during low frequency electrical stimulation of intralaminar nuclei (<a href=\"#bib67\">Morison and Dempsey, 1942</a>), is hypothesized to originate from this inhibition (<a href=\"#bib16\">Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1997</a>). Our observation that individual stimuli sometimes trigger spikes in cortex (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) is consistent with the possibility that these phenomena occur during the delivered 10\u2009Hz optogenetic stimuli. However, intracellular and laminar recordings are needed to more conclusively resolve this issue. More recently, a study utilizing optogenetic targeting showed that non-specific \u2018matrix\u2019 thalamocortical neurons preferentially drive inhibitory interneurons in cortical layer I (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cruikshank et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, they found that IPSPs generated by stimulation of matrix neurons (which constitute the nuclei targeted here [<a href=\"#bib48\">Jones, 2001</a>]) remain sustained during repeated stimuli compared to those evoked by stimulation of non-matrix neurons. Given the above findings, it is possible that interneuron-mediated thalamocortical inhibition, in addition to the demonstrated role of ZI, may contribute to the observed cortical responses. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no in vivo\u00a0studies demonstrating that cortical interneuron-to-pyramidal cell inhibition is stronger at low frequencies of intralaminar thalamic stimulation compared to high frequencies."

It has been shown that different sensory stimuli can evoke positive and negative BOLD signals in the same cortical area, which are linked to increases and decreases in neural activity, respectively (<a href=\"#bib89\">Shmuel et al., 2006</a>). Building\u00a0upon these studies, we found that direct stimulation of central thalamus excitatory neurons at different frequencies leads to activation or suppression of neuronal activity in a downstream cortical location, which is coupled with positive and negative BOLD signals, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These findings strongly support the hypothesis that a major component of the negative BOLD signal derives from decreases in neuronal activity and are consistent with previous reports of tight neural-hemodynamic coupling in the somatosensory cortex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Huttunen et al., 2008</a>)."

The study by Logothetis et al. also found that cortical regions which are polysynaptically connected to the lateral geniculate nucleus, such as V2, even exhibit negative BOLD responses at high frequencies of stimulation (&gt;60\u2009Hz). It was proposed that these polysynaptic deactivations result from frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition, the process by which pyramidal cells in cortex inhibit local and remote pyramidal cells via GABAergic interneurons. Unlike the study by Logothetis et al., we did not observe significant negative BOLD signals in either mono- or polysynaptically connected regions of cortex during high frequencies of stimulation. Furthermore, given the bias of corticocortical disynaptic inhibition toward higher frequencies (<a href=\"#bib90\">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</a>), this microcircuit is unlikely to be driving the observed suppression of cortex during 10\u2009Hz central thalamus stimulation."

With electrical stimulation, it has been impossible to dissociate these two effects in vivo, since the frequency of stimulation and preferential recruitment of specific neuronal populations could not be decoupled (<a href=\"#bib64\">McIntyre and Grill, 2002</a>). This made it difficult to explain, for example, the relationship between stimulation parameters and the therapeutic efficacy of DBS. Using targeted, temporally precise, optogenetic stimulation in the current study allowed us to selectively excite a single group of neuronal elements and identify their specific role in creating distinct modes of network function. The use of electrical stimulation instead would have prevented us from gaining this unique insight into the specific role of excitatory central thalamus neurons and their spiking frequency."

Furthermore, the widespread activation of cortex and striatum observed at high frequencies of stimulation adds to a growing body of evidence that the central thalamus is a highly appropriate target for the remediation of acquired cognitive disabilities via forebrain recruitment. In a more general context that extends beyond stimulation of central thalamus, the ofMRI techniques we employ here are generalizable and can be universally applied to study the mechanisms underlying DBS for other target regions and disorders. With this knowledge, stimulation paradigms can be optimized to accelerate clinical translation for a wide range of neurological disorders that currently lack such treatment, paving the way for the development of next-generation DBS therapies."

After securing the animal within a stereotactic frame, small craniotomies were performed using a dental drill above the region of interest. For stimulation, the cannula implanted at central thalamus was connected to a 473\u00a0nm laser source (Laserglow Technologies) with an output power level of 2.5 mW via an optical fiber. The cannula implanted at ZI was connected to a 593\u00a0nm laser source (Laserglow Technologies) calibrated to 2.5\u20133.0 mW. An acute 16-channel microelectrode array was targeted to the recording site using stereotactic instruments (NeuroNexus Technologies; A1x16 standard model linear electrode array for local and cortical recordings; V1-16-Poly2 polytrode array for ZI recordings; 0.35 \u00b1 0.5 MOhm impedance). A stainless steel reference screw was placed above the cerebellum. Continuous field potential and single unit spiking events were recorded using the Plexon omniplex system with plexcontrol software (Plexon Inc., TX).

When ChR2 and eNpHR were activated together, the same stimulation paradigm was followed, except that a 30\u2009s period of continuous 593 nm light delivery began 5\u2009s before the onset of ChR2 excitation. When only eNpHR was activated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), a 20 or 30\u2009s period of continuous 593 nm light delivery was used, with 40 or 30\u2009s periods of no light delivery between repeated cycles, respectively. For single unit responses, the Plexon multichannel acquisition processor was used to amplify and band-pass filter the neuronal signals (150\u2009Hz \u2013 8 kHz). Signals were digitized at 40 kHz and processed to extract action potentials in real-time.

Brains were extracted and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. The brains were equilibrated in 10%, 20%, and then 30% sucrose in PBS at 4\u00b0C. Coronal sections (50 \u03bcm) were prepared on a freezing microtome (HM 430 Sliding Microtome, Thermo Scientific Inc.). Consecutive sections (500 \u00b5m apart) were mounted and examined with a fluorescence microscope (Leica EL6000). For quantitative immunohistochemistry (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), free-floating sections were processed with 5% normal donkey serum, and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 60\u2009min. Sections were then exposed at 4\u00b0C for 48\u2009hr to primary antibodies against mouse monoclonal CaMKII\u03b1 (CaMKII\u03b1, 1:500, 05\u2013532, Millipore, Billerica, MA). After washing with PBS, sections incubated for 2\u2009hr at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:250, Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Slices were then washed and mounted (DAPI-Fluoromount G, SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). Immuno-fluorescence was assessed with a laser confocal microscope (Leica CTR 6500)."

Post-freezing, the Neg-50 embedded brain was sectioned on a Microm HM550 cryostat using the tape-transfer method with all sections mounted directly onto slides. Alternating sections, cut at 20 \u03bcm, were separated to form two distinct series per brain. One slide series of the sectioned material was processed for Nissl cell body staining, using a thionin-based protocol and coverslipped with DPX mounting medium. The alternate series was dehydrated and directly coverslipped with DPX for fluorescence imaging. Whole-slide digital imaging was performed using a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer 2.0-HT system at 0.46 \u03bcm/pixel, with fluorescence scans at 12-bit depth using a tri-pass filter cube. Following data conversion to lossless jp2 (JPEG2000), individual brain sections were aligned and registered using rigid 2-D image transformation."

For in vivo electrophysiology measurements at thalamus and ZI, one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to evaluate changes in firing rate between the pre-stimulation and stimulation periods. For measurements at sensory cortex in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, a two-tailed version of the test was used to evaluate either increases or decreases in firing rate. For results in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, the average pre-stimulus firing rate (20\u2009s bin) was compared to the average firing rate of four 5\u2009s bins over the 20\u2009s period of stimulation using a one-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. One-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to evaluate differences in SLO occurrence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), as well as changes in cortical or incertal firing when eNpHR activation was coupled with central thalamus stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,H</a>). For electrophysiology results, independence was assumed between repeated trials. All other assumptions for these tests were satisfied. For volumetric comparisons in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2,</a> one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to identify increases in the volume of BOLD activation between 10 and 40\u2009Hz and 10 and 100\u2009Hz (corrected for multiple comparisons). Note that variance was generally similar across groups being compared. Significance was determined at the \u03b1 = 0.05 cutoff level. No statistical methods were used to estimate sample size. All statistical tests used to compare changes with frequency (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) were performed pairwise, with an equal number of animals used for each frequency."

This observation clearly speaks to the potential use of these findings to guide developmental work on DBS for therapeutic purposes. In particular, the authors show that changing frequency of stimulation can change the brain response from broad activation of forebrain circuits for high frequency stimulation to decreased arousal and negative BOLD signals for low frequency stimulation. One could imagine using the first stimulation pattern or patterns similar to it help enhance arousal in patients who are minimally conscious or in a vegetative states, whereas the second pattern might prove useful for treating seizures. At any rate, the results offer a principled way to investigate the basic science of DBS and to learn more about the brain's arousal circuits by combining two modalities."

By using optogenetic activation of the central thalamus in combination with fMRI (and other techniques), they demonstrate how the activation of somas in the central thalamus is enough to induce large changes in cortical BOLD signal, later correlated with single unit firing. The authors demonstrate that while high (40-100 Hz) frequency stimulation of the central thalamus activates different cortical (and subcortical) areas causing arousal, low (10 Hz) frequencies reduce cortical activity. The responses of zona incerta to the same stimulation patterns are compatible with a potential role of this area in the switch between both effects, at least those concerning some areas of the cortex. Even when a definitive causal and mechanistic relationship is not established, the study is relevant for both basic neuroscience \u2013 it brings together the single neuron level to the whole brain activation and it gives a feasible systems level interpretation of the phenomena \u2013 and also for the applied, clinical implications."

What inputs does it receive? Is central thalamus projecting to zona incerta?

This has been studied previously but there is very little reflection of that knowledge here. I can think of a series of studies in the rat that investigated the cortical effects of frequency-dependent electrical stimulation in the VL/VA thalamic region (adjacent to the targeted CL/PC region) in rats. Those studies showed that stimulation in various thalamic nuclei evoke short-latency frequency-depend excitatory cortical responses that can augment (spreading significantly when stimulating in VL/VA) or depress (when stimulating in VPM/VPL). Importantly, at 10 Hz, stimulation always drives strong long-lasting feedforward inhibition, which hyperpolarizes cortical cells immediately after each short-latency excitatory response (e.g. see Fig. 1 in Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1996b). This inhibition of cortical cells may explain the negative BOLD observed in S1 during 10 Hz stimulation (20 sec); under this stimulation regimen, cortical cells will be hyperpolarized most of the time."

Most important is the fact that the authors chose to keep the duty cycle constant across stimulation frequencies. This means that at 10 Hz the light stimulus per cycle lasts 30 ms and at 100 Hz it lasts 3 ms. This is very problematic because the changes that are being attributed to frequency can easily be attributed to pulse duration, which has very significant effects on the responses evoked. Thus, everywhere in the paper where the authors allude to frequency, they are also changing pulse duration, which is a major confound. The only reasonable way to keep the total light duration constant when studying frequency is by increasing the train duration for the lower frequencies and keeping the pulse duration constant."

Stimulation of these other thalamic nuclei in vivo at 10 Hz produces facilitating (spindle-like) responses in cortex, not depressing responses. In fact, work in slices also supports this.

A more recent account of this literature, including more recent studies done in the rat (Dempsey and Morison worked in cats), is presented in Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1997 (not cited by the authors, but highly relevant). Primary responses occur when specific thalamic nuclei are stimulated, such as sensory thalamus. Primary responses depress with frequency. Augmenting and recruiting responses occur when VL, VA, VM, midline or intralaminar thalamic nuclei are stimulated. These responses are similar in that they produce enhanced cortical responses at stimulation frequencies between 7-14 Hz. They differ in their cortical depth profile, indicating that they target different layers (as expected from the known projections), and in the size of the primary response they evoke. VL stimulation evokes augmenting responses with a small primary response (small compared to sensory pathways) in motor cortical areas, which is surface positive. In contrast, recruiting responses are mostly surface negative, lacking the surface positive primary response of augmenting responses. The present study did not record field potential responses in cortex, so it is difficult to know if the responses they evoke at 10 Hz in cortex are augmenting or recruiting. But a consistent finding from intracellular recordings is that strong feedforward inhibition is evoked in cortex in vivo by stimulating the thalamus at 10 Hz (Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1996c; Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1996a). In fact, the area stimulated by the authors is known to evoke recruiting responses, which should yield feedforward inhibitory responses with weaker short-latency excitation (surface positivity) than augmenting responses."

You need to look at feedforward inhibition driven by thalamic stimulation, preferably in vivo.

If in that figure (or Fig. 3 of the same paper) the surface positive field potential component and associated corresponding excitatory drive (which produces the spikes) are eliminated, what is left is a recruiting response, as defined originally by Dempsey and Morison. Similar to spindles, recruiting responses trigger spikes only on some of the waves at 10 Hz. Thus, 3.6 Hz would be consistent with this.

Consequently, light delivery might not only inhibit ZI cells, but other cells too, including adjacent thalamocortical cells. It is therefore possible that the effects observed are due to inhibition of thalamocortical cells. Similarly, could the mCherry fibers observed in cortex actually be thalamocortical fibers? It is also possible that your stimulation could be activating the NRt, which would drive the observed spindles and the recruiting responses in the cortex at 10 Hz, in which case there would be no need for the extrinsic inhibition purportedly provided by ZI. These possibilities should be addressed in the paper. Unless they can be ruled out, conclusions about the role of the zona incerta should be modified accordingly."

Therefore, the recorded signal represents the integration of a larger volume that likely includes excited regions (e.g. motor and cingulate cortex). Indeed, the reviewer\u2019s comment highlights the novelty of our results. While our observation of cortical spike-and-wave activity is consistent with previous studies of thalamic stimulation, the whole-brain visualization afforded by fMRI allowed us to predict the presence of neuronal silencing in a highly localized region of cortex, which we later went on to confirm with electrophysiology.

However, there are several problems with this paper. First, the authors seem to have a poor understanding of the effects that thalamic stimulation delivered at different frequencies has on the cortex. This has been studied previously but there is very little reflection of that knowledge here. I can think of a series of studies in the rat that investigated the cortical effects of frequency-dependent electrical stimulation in the VL/VA thalamic region (adjacent to the targeted CL/PC region) in rats. Those studies showed that stimulation in various thalamic nuclei evoke short-latency frequency-depend excitatory cortical responses that can augment (spreading significantly when stimulating in VL/VA) or depress (when stimulating in VPM/VPL). Importantly, at 10 Hz, stimulation always drives strong long-lasting feedforward inhibition, which hyperpolarizes cortical cells immediately after each short-latency excitatory response (e.g. see Fig. 1 in Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1996b). This inhibition of cortical cells may explain the negative BOLD observed in S1 during 10 Hz stimulation (20 sec); under this stimulation regimen, cortical cells will be hyperpolarized most of the time.</i> "

In particular, we now discuss feedforward inhibition and the possibility that it underlies the observed frequency-dependent silencing of sensory cortex. After careful consideration of existing literature and our own results, we conclude that feedforward thalamocortical inhibition is unlikely to explain the effects reported here. Several lines of evidence point to this conclusion. First, cortical IPSPs driven by feedforward inhibition typically depress after a few repeated stimuli (Cruikshank et al., 2012; Cruikshank et al., 2010). Second, high frequency activity evokes increased levels of interneuron-driven cortical inhibition relative to excitation, whereas low frequency activity does not (Galarreta and Hestrin, 1998). Third, white matter stimulation increases inhibitory synaptic activity in cortex during 40 Hz, but not 10 Hz, stimulation (Contreras and Llinas, 2001). The figure highlighted by the reviewer (Fig. 1 in Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1996b) is informative in highlighting the frequency-dependent properties of thalamic stimulation, but suggests that 10 Hz stimulation still evokes cortical spikes with every stimulus. We did not observe this type of response, with the average firing rate in cortex being 3.6 \u00b1 3.4 Hz (<i>n</i> = 11 neurons, mean \u00b1 std) during the 20 s period of 10 Hz stimulation."

Most important is the fact that the authors chose to keep the duty cycle constant across stimulation frequencies. This means that at 10 Hz the light stimulus per cycle lasts 30 ms and at 100 Hz it lasts 3 ms. This is very problematic because the changes that are being attributed to frequency can easily be attributed to pulse duration, which has very significant effects on the responses evoked. Thus, everywhere in the paper where the authors allude to frequency, they are also changing pulse duration, which is a major confound. The only reasonable way to keep the total light duration constant when studying frequency is by increasing the train duration for the lower frequencies and keeping the pulse duration constant.</i> "

It is notable, however, that our experimental paradigm is unique and fundamentally different compared to those employed in previous studies due to our novel approach of selective excitation of central thalamic relay neurons using optogenetic techniques and the visualization of whole-brain response patterns using fMRI. The several well-characterized thalamocortical properties cited by the reviewer originate from thalamic stimulation in related but distinct experimental preparations (e.g. electrical microstimulation or optogenetic stimulation in reduced preparations), which though clearly directly related, may produce different effects. The precise frequency selectivity of the whole-brain network responses shown here has simply not been demonstrated before (other approaches have been limited to looking at only some pieces of the network at one time). With that said, we agree that many aspects of our findings have interpretations in the context of prior literature. One reviewer relates our findings to the well-known recruiting response, which we agree could possibly co-exist with and/or contribute to the observed responses (see Discussion paragraph five). However, there is a much more clear and compelling comparison to a fourth thalamocortical physiological mode described since the 1940s (in addition to the three already noted by the reviewer) \u2013 the production of high voltage spike-wave activity associated with behavioral arrest. This mode is directly supported by our data, as we show that 10 Hz stimulations generate spike-wave EEG and behavioral arrest patterns, and concretely link our stimulation paradigm to the zona incerta (see below).

A more recent account of this literature, including more recent studies done in the rat (Dempsey and Morison worked in cats), is presented in Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1997 (not cited by the authors, but highly relevant). Primary responses occur when specific thalamic nuclei are stimulated, such as sensory thalamus. Primary responses depress with frequency. Augmenting and recruiting responses occur when VL, VA, VM, midline or intralaminar thalamic nuclei are stimulated. These responses are similar in that they produce enhanced cortical responses at stimulation frequencies between 7-14 Hz. They differ in their cortical depth profile, indicating that they target different layers (as expected from the known projections), and in the size of the primary response they evoke. VL stimulation evokes augmenting responses with a small primary response (small compared to sensory pathways) in motor cortical areas, which is surface positive. In contrast, recruiting responses are mostly surface negative, lacking the surface positive primary response of augmenting responses. The present study did not record field potential responses in cortex, so it is difficult to know if the responses they evoke at 10 Hz in cortex are augmenting or recruiting. But a consistent finding from intracellular recordings is that strong feedforward inhibition is evoked in cortex in vivo by stimulating the thalamus at 10 Hz (Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1996c; Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1996a). In fact, the area stimulated by the authors is known to evoke recruiting responses, which should yield feedforward inhibitory responses with weaker short-latency excitation (surface positivity) than augmenting responses. The reviewer concludes that by citing papers based on specific thalamic nuclei, such as core sensory thalamic nuclei (Cruikshank et al., 2010), is not appropriate, because it is well known that the pathways stimulated in this study have different response properties.</i> "

We also include citations (Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1997) and (Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1996c) listed above, and discuss the recruiting response and its hypothesized mechanism of hyperpolarization driven by thalamic stimulation. However, we wish to add that the list of three cortical responses described by the reviewer (primary, augmenting, and recruiting) omits another key mode of thalamocortical activation \u2013 namely, the generation of spike-wave cortical activity and behavioral arrest that is known in human subjects as the absence seizure and is modeled in various rodent strains. Indeed, the reference provided by the reviewer (Castro-Alamancos and Connors, 1997) also ends with a discussion of this general phenomenon. However, it is not presented as an isolated mode of cortical response, likely because it is a network property and is not well isolated in the experimental contexts in which the other three responses are characterized. We would point out that our experimental framework of whole-brain imaging is uniquely suited to characterize the circuit-level differences of stimulation frequency across the entire brain during sustained, steady-state activation (approximating the typical approach used in deep brain stimulation) rather than the methods used to study primary, augmenting, and recruiting responses (which are generated by shorter duration stimulation paradigms and lack specific behavioral correlates)."

We are led to zona incerta directly from these data and existing literature on rodent absence seizures that points to the ZI\u2019s role in modulating spike-wave discharges (see Introduction). We also wish to emphasize that we are not the first group to suggest a key role for incertofugal inhibition in spike-wave activity or to probe this possibility experimentally. For example, one study (Shaw et al., 2013) concluded, \u201cMembrane hyperpolarization due to the intensive inhibitory GABAergic actions is beneficial for maintaining brain rhythms [\u2026] Delayed rhythmic incertal activity may help to develop membrane hyperpolarization that builds up sustained high-voltage cortical rhythms through GABAergic incertofugal pathways.\u201d This point has been clarified in the revised manuscript (see Discussion)."

You need to look at feedforward inhibition driven by thalamic stimulation, preferably in vivo. The other cited slice paper (Cruikshank et al., 2012), looked at feedforward inhibition driven by thalamic inputs but only marginally (only 1 example panel in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> and no group data). It is hard to derive any strong conclusions other than to say that inhibition is there, albeit depressed compared to the 1st stimulus.</i> "

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no study has directly compared the frequency-dependent strength of cortical interneuron-mediated thalamocortical inhibition during intralaminar thalamic stimulation in vivo. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the extent to which this inhibition would vary between our 10, 40, and 100 Hz stimulations. Intracellular recordings would be an appropriate means to further investigate this issue, a discussion point we have added to the revised manuscript. Until these experiments are conducted, our results stand on their own as a novel and exciting demonstration that zona incerta plays a causal role in modulating cortical inhibition induced by central thalamus stimulation. While zona incerta has previously been implicated in modulating spike-wave discharges and associated absence seizures, we were able to link this relationship to specific whole-brain activity patterns and a previously described inhibitory pathway originating from ZI."

If in that figure (or Fig. 3 of the same paper) the surface positive field potential component and associated corresponding excitatory drive (which produces the spikes) are eliminated, what is left is a recruiting response, as defined originally by Dempsey and Morison. Similar to spindles, recruiting responses trigger spikes only on some of the waves at 10 Hz. Thus, 3.6 Hz would be consistent with this. It would be helpful if you were to present PSTHs using each stimulus of the 10 Hz train as the marker (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).</i> "

These figures show that spike events have a non-uniform distribution over time and are more likely to occur after a 6-34 ms latency from the onset of individual light pulses. While such a pattern is expected to occur during disynaptic thalamocortical inhibition (and is therefore compatible with the reviewer\u2019s hypothesis), it should be noted that it does not confirm or implicate the presence of thalamocortical inhibition mediated by cortical interneurons. Instead, this pattern only suggests that the evoked inhibition is not strong enough to completely eliminate the spikes evoked monosynaptically by excitatory thalamocortical afferents. In other words, while the PSTHs are consistent with cortical interneurons driving the observed inhibition (in the sense that they show a stimulus-driven excitatory response), the observed histogram distributions would likely also be present if inhibition was mediated by an external source such as zona incerta."

Consequently, light delivery might not only inhibit ZI cells, but other cells too, including adjacent thalamocortical cells. It is therefore possible that the effects observed are due to inhibition of thalamocortical cells. Similarly, could the mCherry fibers observed in cortex actually be thalamocortical fibers? It is also possible that your stimulation could be activating the NRt, which would drive the observed spindles and the recruiting responses in the cortex at 10 Hz, in which case there would be no need for the extrinsic inhibition purportedly provided by ZI. These possibilities should be addressed in the paper. Unless they can be ruled out, conclusions about the role of the zona incerta should be modified accordingly.</i> "

Furthermore, virtually none of the cone includes the thalamus (which already has a low mCherry expression-level compared to ZI), suggesting that the effects observed are not due to inhibition of thalamocortical cells. Notably, the incomplete coverage of zona incerta by the 593 nm cone of activation may explain why inhibition is not fully reversed across all recorded cells in cortex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>)."
