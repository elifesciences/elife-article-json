Hin is a member of the DNA invertase subclass of serine recombinases that are regulated by a remote recombinational enhancer element containing two binding sites for the protein Fis. Two Hin dimers bound to specific recombination sites associate with the Fis-bound enhancer by DNA looping where they are remodeled into a synaptic tetramer competent for DNA chemistry and exchange. Here we show that the flexible beta-hairpin arms of the Fis dimers contact the DNA binding domain of one subunit of each Hin dimer. These contacts sandwich the Hin dimers to promote remodeling into the tetramer. A basic region on the Hin catalytic domain then contacts enhancer DNA to complete assembly of the active Hin tetramer. Our results reveal how the enhancer generates the recombination complex that specifies DNA inversion and regulates DNA exchange by the subunit rotation mechanism."

Hin is a member of the DNA invertase subclass of serine recombinases that are regulated by a remote recombinational enhancer element containing two binding sites for the protein Fis. Two Hin dimers bound to specific recombination sites associate with the Fis-bound enhancer by DNA looping where they are remodeled into a synaptic tetramer competent for DNA chemistry and exchange. Here we show that the flexible beta-hairpin arms of the Fis dimers contact the DNA binding domain of one subunit of each Hin dimer. These contacts sandwich the Hin dimers to promote remodeling into the tetramer. A basic region on the Hin catalytic domain then contacts enhancer DNA to complete assembly of the active Hin tetramer. Our results reveal how the enhancer generates the recombination complex that specifies DNA inversion and regulates DNA exchange by the subunit rotation mechanism."

A protein called HU then causes the DNA to bend and form a loop, and the four Hin subunits and the two Fis dimers all come together at the enhancer to form a structure called the invertasome where the recombination reaction occurs. All four DNA strands at the crossover point are broken as a result of a near simultaneous attack by the catalytic serine amino acids in the Hin subunits. One pair of Hin subunits\u2013and the two DNA strands attached to them\u2013then rotate by 180 degrees around the other pair of Hin subunits.

Two of the Hin subunits are clamped onto the enhancer by the Fis dimers and by directly interacting with the enhancer DNA, but the other two (and the DNA strands attached to them) are free to rotate within the tetramer. In the <i>Salmonella</i> chromosome the enhancer is located close to one of the <i>hix</i> sites (\u223c100 base pairs away from it), so the length of the DNA between the enhancer and <i>hix</i> site physically limits the number of Hin subunit rotations to just one."

We show that Fis contacts to inactive Hin dimers at an early step of invertasome formation lead to assembly of catalytically-active tetramers. Unexpectedly, we find that a localized basic surface on the Hin catalytic domain is also required for enhancer-dependent assembly of active tetramers and demonstrate using tethered chemical nucleases that it is associated with enhancer DNA between the two Fis dimers.

The remaining eight lysines were each individually mutated to alanine and tested for crosslinking with Fis-Q21C; a truncation mutant missing the two C-terminal lysines was also evaluated. Each of the mutants accumulated substantial amounts of cleaved invertasomes at the time of crosslinking (10 min incubation), as also shown by the levels of covalent Hin-(<sup>32</sup>P-DNA) products (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Hin-K146C at the N-terminus of helix 1 within the DBD generated \u223c15% crosslinked Fis-Hin products (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>), a level similar to that of wild-type Hin crosslinked to Fis-Q21C by AMAS. Hin-K158C at the C-terminus of the DBD helix 1 generated low levels of BMOE-mediated crosslinks with Fis-Q21C. No cysteine substitutions within the catalytic domain generated crosslinks (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that the alanine mutations (e.g., Hin-K51A in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>) may have disrupted the AMAS-mediated crosslinking via an indirect mechanism (see below). Additional solvent-exposed residues within the DBD helix 1 region were converted to cysteine and those that generated substantial levels of DNA-cleaved invertasomes were tested for BMOE crosslinking with Fis-Q21C (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). Hin-H147C, Hin-E150C, and Hin-Q151C within the \u03b1-helix formed crosslinks with Fis-Q21C, but H160C in the loop connecting to DBD helix 2 did not generate crosslinks. The 8 \u00c5 crosslinks between Fis-Q21C and five positions within helix 1 of the Hin DBD demonstrate that the Hin DBD is in close proximity to the Fis \u03b2-hairpin arms in the DNA-cleaved invertasome."

In order to confirm that mutations of these residues specifically affect Fis-activation and not protein misfolding or other aspects of the recombination reaction such as site synapsis or DNA chemistry, rescue experiments were performed. Hin-R154A and Hin-L155A were each coupled to the gain-of-function mutation Hin-H107Y, which can catalyze recombination without the Fis/enhancer system (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sanders and Johnson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heiss et al., 2011</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, wild-type Hin recombines the plasmid substrate to a near equilibrium mixture of parental and inverted products within 5 min in the presence of Fis, whereas Hin-L155A inverts less than 2% of the substrate in the same amount of time. In contrast, both Hin-H107Y and the double mutant Hin-H107Y/L155A catalyze recombination in the absence of Fis at similar rates.

Lys51 is located within the predicted helix-B of the Hin catalytic domain, which contains two other basic residues, Arg48 and Lys47 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Hin-R48A failed to form detectable AMAS crosslinks under standard conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Hin-K47A associates unstably with the enhancer as demonstrated by relatively efficient Fis-Hin crosslinking at early times but undetectable crosslinking after 20 min incubation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Fis-activated DNA inversion rates of Hin-R47A, R48A, and K51A are moderately decreased with R47A and K51A exhibiting about threefold reductions in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). However, the combinations of K47A/R48A and R48A/K51A severely impair Fis-activated Hin inversion both in vivo and in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). These mutations have no effect on Hin binding to <i>hix</i> (data not shown). To confirm that these residues are directly functioning in Fis/enhancer-activation, Hin-R48A/K51A was coupled to the gain-of-function mutation Hin-H107Y. Hin-R48A/K51A/H107Y promotes Fis-independent inversion at rates that are indistinguishable from the single H107Y mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), demonstrating that these mutations are not disturbing Hin catalytic properties.

Therefore, DNA exchange is normally limited to a single 180\u00b0 rotation step, resulting in an unknotted inversion product. Additional subunit rotations, which generate DNA knots of increasing complexity, can occur when the enhancer is released from the invertasome complex. Reactions employing Fis mutants that have weakened interactions with Hin (<a href=\"#bib36\">Merickel and Johnson, 2004</a>), or Hin DBD mutants that have weakened interactions with Fis (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) lead to processive recombination.

On the other hand, wild-type Hin knotted 30% of the reacted substrates with a long spacer between the <i>hix</i> site and the enhancer. Hin-R48A and Hin-K51A, however, are insensitive to the length of the loop between the <i>hix1</i> site and the enhancer; both mutants knotted about 40% of the reacted short spacer substrates corresponding to an eightfold increase in processive DNA exchange compared with wild-type Hin. The increased processive DNA exchange by Hin-R48A and Hin-R51A provide further evidence that these mutations destabilize the association of the enhancer with the Hin synaptic complex."

Stabilized DNA-cleaved invertasomes were assembled with Fis-Q21C and Hin-wt and crosslinked with AMAS (4.4 \u00c5 spacer) or GMBS (7.3 \u00c5 spacer). Uncrosslinked and Fis-Hin crosslinked invertasomes were then switched to reaction conditions allowing for ligation. As recognized by the loss of the Hin serine-DNA linkage in the Fis-Hin-(<sup>32</sup>P-DNA) and Hin-(<sup>32</sup>P-DNA) bands, both the Fis-Hin crosslinked (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, lanes 3, 4 and 5, 6) and uncrosslinked (lanes 1, 2) complexes were able to efficiently promote DNA ligation. We conclude that ligation can efficiently occur when Hin is covalently linked to Fis, reinforcing earlier topological data indicating that the enhancer normally remains associated with the Hin complex throughout the reaction (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heichman et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Merickel and Johnson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dhar et al., 2009a</a>)."

These connections involve: (1) the DBDs of two Hin subunits with the \u03b2-hairpin arms of the Fis dimers, and (2) the catalytic domains of Hin with the enhancer DNA between the bound Fis dimers. As elaborated below, our new understanding of the connections between the eight protein polypeptides and three DNA segments, combined with existing molecular structures, enable us to construct a structural model of the Hin invertasome that catalyzes DNA exchange. We also provide experimental evidence for an early intermediate in the invertasome assembly pathway consisting of Hin dimers associated with Fis at the enhancer. The molecular architectures of intermediate and DNA-cleaved invertasome complexes reveal how the Fis/enhancer element functions at different steps to initiate and regulate DNA recombination by serine invertases."

The results of further mutagenesis of these residues are presented here. Fis mutants were evaluated for activation of Hin-catalyzed DNA inversion in vivo using the same <i>lacZ</i> reporter system as utilized for the Hin mutants, except that the Fis mutant gene on a plasmid was introduced into the cell containing Hin-wt (see <a href=\"#bib50\">Safo et al., 1997</a> for experimental details). For each residue the order of amino acid residues (top to bottom) reflects their relative in vivo activities. (++++) indicates wild-type activity where red colonies developed on lactose MacConkey agar plates within 27 hr. (+++) indicates red colonies developed between 28\u201330 hr; (++) indicates red colonies between 32\u201334 hr, (+) indicates red colonies after 36\u201338 hr, (\u00b1) indicates evidence of very low inversion after 40 hr, (\u2212) indicates no detectable inversion after 48 hr like the no Fis control. Selected Fis mutants were partially purified and assayed for activation of Hin-catalyzed inversion in vitro. Numbers in parentheses reflect inversion rates relative to Fis-wt (set to 1.0). The data indicate that Fis residues 16 and 22 are most active when hydrophobic (Val, Ile, Leu). Polar substitutions (Ser, Thr, Glu) at Asp20 exhibit moderate activity, and a leucine substitution has surprisingly high activity. These Fis residues are proposed to specifically interact with Hin DBD residues Arg154, Leu155, and possibly Gln151 during invertasome assembly."

The two Hin dimers are sandwiched between the Fis \u03b2-hairpin arms such that the catalytic domains are adjacent to each other and thus optimally positioned to isomerize into a tetramer.

However, the position of Hin helix-B changes substantially relative to the enhancer. Initially, helix-B is at a \u223c50\u00b0 angle with respect to the enhancer DNA with its C-terminal end (Lys51) near the phosphate backbone and the remainder of the helix oriented away (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

Initially, Fis-Hin interactions, together with the propensity of plectonemically supercoiled DNA to form branched DNA structures containing 2 (\u2212) nodes, localize the two <i>hix</i>-bound Hin dimers at the enhancer. As Fis-Hin interactions have not been observed by standard solution assays, conformational energy from DNA supercoiling appears essential to promote synapsis. Formation of the active Hin tetramer could then be driven by mass action forces. For example, dynamic scissor-like movements between subunits of each dimer may transiently expose the hydrophobic surfaces of the apposing dimer interfaces to initiate remodeling into the tetramer. Conformational energy from the Fis/enhancer segment may also be harvested to drive tetramer assembly forward. This energy could be transduced from the twist deficit present in the negatively supercoiled DNA and/or by the mobile Fis \u03b2-hairpin arms to facilitate compaction of the two dimers into the tetramer. Spring-like mechanisms contributing to assembly of active recombination complexes also have been proposed for the Tn10 transpososome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chalmers et al., 1998</a>). Finally, attractive electrostatic forces between the helix-B region and the enhancer DNA promote the final conformational change into the active tetramer structure."

A single clockwise rotation of subunits together with their linked DNA strands will result in inversion of the DNA between the <i>hix</i> sites with an accompanying loss of four supercoils, as shown for Hin- and Gin-mediated DNA inversion (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kanaar et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Merickel and Johnson, 2004</a>). When the distance between a <i>hix</i> site and the enhancer is short, as in the native configuration in the <i>Salmonella</i> chromosome (\u223c100 bp between <i>hixL</i> and the proximal Fis binding site), the small loop will inhibit additional subunit rotations because of torsional strain generated from multiple DNA windings (illustrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). However, additional rotations can occur under conditions where the loop is expanded by release of the Fis/enhancer from the Hin tetramer during the reaction or with substrates containing long segments of DNA between <i>hixL</i> and the enhancer. The structures of the resulting knotted DNA products are fully consistent with DNA exchange initiating within our invertasome model (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kanaar et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Heichman et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Crisona et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Merickel and Johnson, 2004</a>). Thus, the multiple connections stabilizing the Hin tetramer onto the Fis/enhancer element function to restrict processive subunit exchanges. We experimentally demonstrate in this work that the final chemical step in the reaction, Hin-catalyzed DNA ligation, can efficiently occur when Fis and Hin remain physically connected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), implying that the invertasome normally remains intact over the course of the entire reaction."

The Fis dimers were then aligned onto their binding sites based on the co-crystal structure. The Hin DNA-cleaved and pre-cleaved tetramer models were manually docked onto the Fis-bound enhancer such that the Fis \u03b2-hairpin arms were optimally positioned with Arg154 and Leu155 on the Hin DBDs and consistent with the (\u22122) topology of a branched DNA on negatively supercoiled DNA. The model of Hin dimers associated with the enhancer was generated by independently docking Hin dimer-<i>hix</i> models onto the enhancer using the DNA-cleaved tetramer model as a guide to position the Hin DBD relative to Fis. Morphed intermediates (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>) were generated using the Yale Morphing Server (<a href=\"#bib30\">Krebs and Gerstein, 2000</a>).

All agreed that this is an important model system for both a general understanding of how multiprotein complexes assemble on DNA targets with well-separated binding sites and where supercoiling is involved, as well as more specifically for serine recombinase-family proteins. In addition, the paper presents a clever and comprehensive set of experiments that reveal the important contacts of the Hin invertasome both with Fis and with the enhancer DNA. The model for Hin/Fis assembly on DNA provides a satisfying explanation for how Fis stimulates inversion and how the system is wired to specifically carry out inversion with production of primarily unknotted product. A particularly appealing aspect of the work is that it makes use of existing structural models to carry out specific, targeted cross-linking experiments, along with targeted hydroxyl radical cleavage mapping, all of which are technically challenging. However, one of the most interesting findings, the unexpected similarity between invertases and resolvases, e.g., between Hin and Sin, in regions used to make interfaces in their respective synaptic complexes, could be highlighted more clearly in the manuscript."

The explanation of how Fis-Hin interactions could stabilize a synaptic tetramer of Hin subunits seems very plausible and is well supported by a lot of data. The explanation of how the catalytic domain residues contribute also seems reasonable, but one can't help but think that perhaps something else is going on as well. The interaction with enhancer DNA could help promote stable formation of the tetramer, but it is less clear why loss of these interactions leads to a higher frequency of multiple rotations and knotted products. The explanation given is that the Fis/enhancer can more easily detach, leading to less control of the reaction as the short loop increases in size. An additional/alternative source for an explanation can be considered from <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, where the \u2018unknotted recombinant\u2019 is predicted to have DNA crossing over the catalytic domains in a way that does not exist in the parental configuration. Is it not possible that residues 47-51 could interact with this new DNA and contribute to product stabilization in a similar manner? This is more difficult to model than the enhancer DNA, but would be worth mentioning. On the other hand, local stiffness of the DNA might be enough to prevent it from making its way down to helix B even with a little extra torque as shown for the product. It might be useful to clarify your explanation of the topology experiment. Is it correct to say that, with the small loop, if the enhancer stays put, multiple rounds of recombination are energetically uphill because of the conformational strain they'd introduce in the dinky loop. If the enhancer wanders off, the loop can expand to accommodate additional nodes. The control experiment showing that loop size matters for the WT but not for the mutant is very satisfying in this regard."

Especially given that Hin, Sin, and \u03b3\u03b4 have otherwise-different synaptic complexes, and that this corner of the protein contacts other subunits in Sin and (presumably) \u03b3\u03b4, but contacts DNA in Hin, it is reasonable to suspect that there is probably deeper significance to its recurrence in screens. Are the contacts made to the C-terminus of helix B only stabilizing the binding of other entities in the complex, or could they be some sort of \u201cpull tab\u201d by which the accessory proteins/DNA can actively destabilize the dimer and tip the conformational equilibrium toward the active tetramer? The sentence \u201cFinally, attractive electrostatic...\u201d suggests this idea, but better comparisons with \u03b3\u03b4 and Sin would bolster it nicely."

We agree and are happy that <i>eLife</i> allows the space to adequately address this. We have added an expanded section at the end of the Discussion that describes the important similarities between the systems and their general significance with respect to the control of serine recombinases. We highlight relevant regulatory residues in the Sin and \u03b3\u03b4/Tn3 resolvase systems in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and specifically state that resolvase hyperactive mutants containing regulatory mutations analogous to the Hin DBD (Sin) and helix-B (Sin and \u03b3\u03b4/Tn3) interfaces are able to catalyze recombination in the absence of accessory sub-sites. We have added a figure (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 2</a>) comparing the electrostatic surfaces of Hin and resolvase, which illustrates the differences in charge over the helix-B region as well as the alternative basic patch (part of the 2-3\u2032 interface) on resolvase."

The explanation of how Fis-Hin interactions could stabilize a synaptic tetramer of Hin subunits seems very plausible and is well supported by a lot of data. The explanation of how the catalytic domain residues contribute also seems reasonable, but one can't help but think that perhaps something else is going on as well. The interaction with enhancer DNA could help promote stable formation of the tetramer, but it is less clear why loss of these interactions leads to a higher frequency of multiple rotations and knotted products. The explanation given is that the Fis/enhancer can more easily detach, leading to less control of the reaction as the short loop increases in size. An additional/alternative source for an explanation can be considered from</i> <a href=\"#fig4\"><i>Figure 4D</i></a><i>, where the \u2018unknotted recombinant\u2019 is predicted to have DNA crossing over the catalytic domains in a way that does not exist in the parental configuration. Is it not possible that residues 47-51 could interact with this new DNA and contribute to product stabilization in a similar manner? This is more difficult to model than the enhancer DNA, but would be worth mentioning. On the other hand, local stiffness of the DNA might be enough to prevent it from making its way down to helix B even with a little extra torque as shown for the product. It might be useful to clarify your explanation of the topology experiment. Is it correct to say that, with the small loop, if the enhancer stays put, multiple rounds of recombination are energetically uphill because of the conformational strain they'd introduce in the dinky loop. If the enhancer wanders off, the loop can expand to accommodate additional nodes. The control experiment showing that loop size matters for the WT but not for the mutant is very satisfying in this regard</i>."

If we understand correctly, the reviewers suggest that the DNA strand in the small loop is \u201ccaptured\u201d by the catalytic domains of the top subunits (as drawn in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) after DNA exchange, thereby inhibiting further exchanges. Although this is an intriguing idea, it seems to us to be unlikely. As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>, the green DNA emanating from the yellow Hin subunit would have to become severely kinked in order to associate with the helix-B region of the top subunits. As the reviewers note, local DNA stiffness, particularly if the DBD of the yellow subunit remains bound to DNA, would strongly disfavor such a configuration."

Especially given that Hin, Sin, and \u03b3\u03b4 have otherwise-different synaptic complexes, and that this corner of the protein contacts other subunits in Sin and (presumably) \u03b3\u03b4, but contacts DNA in Hin, it is reasonable to suspect that there is probably deeper significance to its recurrence in screens. Are the contacts made to the C-terminus of helix B only stabilizing the binding of other entities in the complex, or could they be some sort of \u201cpull tab\u201d by which the accessory proteins/DNA can actively destabilize the dimer and tip the conformational equilibrium toward the active tetramer?
