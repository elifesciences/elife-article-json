Notch is further characterized by a twofold relationship with its Delta-Serrate (DSL) ligands, as ligands from opposing cells (<i>trans</i>-ligands) activate Notch, whereas ligands expressed in the same cell (<i>cis</i>-ligands) inhibit signaling. We show that cells without both <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-</i>ligands can mediate Notch-dependent developmental events during <i>Drosophila</i> oogenesis, indicating ligand-independent Notch activity occurs when the receptor is free of <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-ligands. Furthermore, <i>cis</i>-ligands can reduce Notch activity in endogenous and genetically induced situations of elevated <i>trans</i>-ligand-independent Notch signaling. We conclude that <i>cis</i>-expressed ligands exert their repressive effect on Notch signaling in cases of <i>trans</i>-ligand-independent activation, and propose a new function of <i>cis</i>-inhibition which buffers cells against accidental Notch activity."

(<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> provides a brief schematic depiction of the stages of early oogenesis.) At oogenesis stage 7, Notch signaling is activated in the somatic follicle cells by a robust germline Dl upregulation, which leads to the expression of <i>Hindsight</i> (<i>Hnt</i>), downregulation of <i>Cut</i>, and the polyploidization of the follicle cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Deng et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">L\u00f3pez-Schier and St Johnston, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Sun and Deng, 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). When <i>Dl</i> germline mutant clones were generated (i.e., <i>trans</i>-activation was removed), the follicle cells failed to downregulate <i>Cut</i> expression, which persisted past stage 7, indicative of a failure to activate Notch (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In contrast, <i>Dl</i> follicle cell mutant clones show precocious <i>Cut</i> downregulation at stage 6 attributable to the relief of <i>cis</i>-inhibition (<a href=\"#bib23\">Poulton et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Surprisingly, <i>Dl</i> mutant clones in the follicle cells bordering <i>Dl</i> mutant clones in the germline (i.e., a germline with no signaling source, herein referred to as <i>Dl-/Dl-</i> cells) show correct <i>Hnt</i> and <i>Cut</i> expression from stage 7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). These <i>Dl-/Dl-</i> clones also correctly transit into the endocycle, as their nuclear volumes are similar to wild-type follicle cells in the later stages of oogenesis after polyploidization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>), whereas cells neighboring <i>Dl-/Dl-</i> follicle cell clones (retaining a <i>cis</i>-ligand but without a <i>trans</i>-ligand) are comparable to wild-type cells before entry to endocycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>). Removal of both <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-</i>Dl through knockdown of Dl by RNA interference (RNAi) simultaneously in the germline and soma confirmed this finding (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Together, these observations provide evidence that follicle cells without both <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-</i>ligand sources can still enter the endocycle stages of oogenesis. This back-up route to the endocycle is not a co-option of Ser in place of Dl, as <i>Dl</i><sup><i>RevF10</i></sup><i>Ser</i><sup><i>Rx82</i></sup> double clones recapitulated the <i>Dl-/Dl-</i> phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

                        "text": "To determine whether the entry into the endocycle in <i>Dl-/Dl-</i> follicle cells still requires the function of Notch, we implemented the mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) system (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lee and Luo, 2001</a>). The MARCM system enables us to create mutant clones while driving expression of a UAS transgene specifically in those clonal cells. <i>Dl-/Dl-</i> clones driving expression of <i>Notch</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup> show a significantly higher proportion (p &lt; 0.0001) of late <i>Cut</i>-expressing cells than the <i>Dl-/Dl-</i> clones alone, indicating that Notch is still required for the mitotic-to-endocycle switch (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D and 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Likewise, MARCM clones for the null allele of Suppressor of Hairless (Drosophila Notch transcriptional effector), <i>Su(H)</i><sup><i>47</i></sup>, in RNAi-induced <i>Dl-/Dl-</i> clones also show late <i>Cut</i> expression (p &lt; 0.0001) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) in comparison with RNAi-induced <i>Dl/Dl-</i> clone controls (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,D</a>). A Notch activity reporter, Notch Responsive Element (NRE)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Stempfle et al., 2010</a>) was also upregulated in <i>Dl-/Dl-</i> clones as early as stage 2, and this expression persisted beyond stage 6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>), suggesting that NRE-GFP is probably more sensitive to Notch activation than Hnt in follicle cells. Together, these results suggest that Notch activity occurs independently of canonical ligands when both <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-</i>ligands are removed, resulting in normal downstream developmental events in the follicle cells. Consistently, <i>Dl</i><sup><i>RevF10</i></sup><i>Ser</i><sup><i>Rx82</i></sup> double mutant clones in the wing and eye discs show a slight cell-autonomous upregulation of NRE-GFP in the clone center, which would only occur if <i>cis</i>-inhibition blocked a DSL-independent mode of Notch activity, as interior cells have no access to <i>trans</i>-ligand (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). This NRE-GFP upregulation was spatially variable in the wing disc, having the highest prevalence in the notum region (25% incidence), a low incidence in the dorsal pouch (8%), whereas in the ventral pouch region it was never seen (n = 80) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), perhaps owing to the differential regulation of Notch degradation throughout the wing disc (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hori et al., 2011</a>). As reported previously, most wing disc clones showed a higher NRE-GFP upregulation in the clone boundary where there is access to <i>trans</i>-ligand, indicating that the ligand-independent Notch activity observed occurs at a rather low level."

Upon transfection with <i>pMT-N</i><sup><i>FL</i></sup>, a CuSO<sub>4</sub>-inducible full-length Notch construct, Notch activation was increased by a factor of 5.13 compared with the control cells, as indicated by a NRE-firefly luciferase reporter gene (p &lt; 0.0001) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Notch activation in S2 cells is at least partially dependent on endosomal trafficking, as double-stranded (ds) RNA against early endosome component, <i>Rab5</i>, or multivesicular body sorting protein, <i>hrs</i>, reduced the levels of Notch activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). This is consistent with the in vivo studies indicating that ligand-independent Notch activation relies heavily on receptor trafficking (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hori et al., 2012</a>) (<i>Rab5</i> p = 0.00623, <i>hrs</i> p = 0.0159), and our observation that Notch accumulates in <i>Dl-/Dl-</i> clones (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A requirement for trafficking is consistent with the results of others who have demonstrated aberrant Notch activation in follicle cell mutants for trafficking components (<a href=\"#bib32\">Wilkin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Vaccari et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Schneider et al., 2013</a>), such as <i>tsg101</i> mutant clones, which show early Notch activation in the follicle cells (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Furthermore, co-transfecting <i>pMT-N</i><sup><i>FL</i></sup> with <i>pMT-GAL4</i> and <i>pUASt-Ser</i><sup><i>del3</i></sup>, a form of <i>Ser</i> that cannot activate Notch, but only <i>cis</i>-inhibit, (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fleming et al., 2013</a>) almost entirely abolished the Notch activation detected when N<sup>FL</sup> was transfected alone (p = 0.0048) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These results suggest that if Notch is expressed in a cell free of <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-</i>ligands, DSL ligand-independent activity will occur and that <i>cis</i>-inhibition is extremely efficient in preventing this \u2018accidental\u2019 Notch activity as it travels through the endosomal pathway en route to degradation."

Notch activation in <i>lgd</i> mutant cells is caused by a defect in Notch trafficking and degradation, as the receptor is aberrantly transported to the limiting membrane of the lysosome which facilitates production of N<sup>ICD</sup> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Childress et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Gallagher and Knoblich, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Jaekel and Klein, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Schneider et al., 2013</a>). Using dpp-GAL4 to misexpress <i>UAS-Dl</i> along the anterior\u2013posterior axis of the wing disc in <i>lgd</i><sup><i>d7</i></sup> homozygous larvae, Wg expression was considerably reduced along the <i>dpp</i> expression domain, indicating that <i>cis</i>-inhibition can block the ligand-independent Notch activity observed in this situation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Overexpression of <i>Deltex</i> (<i>Dx</i>), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that stimulates Notch monoubiquitination and promotes its trafficking to the lysosomal limiting membrane, has also been shown to induce ligand-independent Notch activation specifically in the ventral wing pouch region (<a href=\"#bib19\">Matsuno et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hori et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Wilkin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Schneider et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We used <i>patched</i> (<i>ptc</i>)-GAL4 to drive expression of <i>UAS-Dx</i> with either <i>UAS-Dl</i> or <i>UAS-Ser</i><sup><i>del3</i></sup>, whose ectopic expression leads to a reduction of Wg staining along the dorsoventral boundary (<a href=\"#bib20\">Micchelli et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Fleming et al., 2013</a>) (controls in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,E</a>).

Misexpressing <i>UAS-Ser</i><sup><i>del3</i></sup> increased the frequency of witnessing bursting crystal cells (see arrowheads in <b>B</b>) (<b>B</b> and <b>E</b>). Lymph glands were counted for each genotype (n = 14 for <i>lz &gt; GFP</i>, n = 12 for <i>lz &gt; GFP; UAS-Notch</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup>, and n = 14 for <i>lz &gt; GFP; UAS-Ser</i><sup><i>del3</i></sup>). Welch's t-test was used to assess significance between wild-type (WT) lymph glands and each of the experimental groups (p = 0.043 and p = 0.029, respectively). To determine whether <i>Ser</i><sup><i>del3</i></sup>-misexpression induced \u2018bursting\u2019 was caused by the <i>cis</i>-inhibitory effect of Ser on ligand-independent Notch activation, we used the Notch activity reporter <i>E(spl):m\u03b2-CD2</i>. We focused our analysis on larger crystal cells, which enter the endocycle as part of their differentiation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Terriente-Felix et al., 2013</a>), and therefore are the ones most probably undergoing ligand-independent Notch activation. For illustrations, all GFP-positive cells were outlined and were filled in with differing shades of red corresponding to Notch reporter staining intensity. <i>E(spl)m\u03b2:CD2</i> is expressed in 55% of crystal cells and 77.4% of mature crystal cells (<b>C</b> and <b>F</b>). Misexpression of <i>UAS-Ser</i><sup><i>WT</i></sup> significantly (p &lt; 0.0001 for mature crystal cells, p = 0.0457 if all crystal cells were taken into account) reduced the fraction of crystal cells which show <i>E(spl)m\u03b2:CD2</i> expression, with 34.4% of all cells showing expression and 20.7% of mature cells showing <i>CD2</i> expression (<b>D</b> and <b>F</b>). For this analysis, the total number of <i>lz &gt; GFP</i> cells were counted, taking into account their size, lz &gt; GFP intensity, and E(spl)CD2 intensity. Mature crystal cells were defined as cells that were both large and had intense lz &gt; GFP. We then took the proportion of either all cells, or mature cells which had E(spl)CD2 staining for each lymph gland (n = 12 for <i>lz &gt; GFP</i>, n = 13 for <i>lz &gt; GFP;UAS-Ser</i>). Grubbs' outlier test was used, which removed one data point (p &lt; 0.05) from the control, which had an unusually small number of crystal cells. Then Welch's t-test was used to assess significance between the mean proportions of crystal cells which showed Notch activity. All error bars represent SD. These observations indicate that increased ligand expression in crystal cells decreases cell survival by blocking Notch ligand-independent activation, and therefore the buffering role of <i>cis</i>-expressed ligand can be extended to endogenous cases of DSL-independent Notch activity.

During development, this type of noncanonical Notch activity is normally prevented by <i>cis</i>-expressed DSL ligands in numerous tissues. <i>Cis</i>-inhibition can also attenuate DSL-ligand independent Notch activity both in endogenous and genetically induced situations. Mechanistically, this could be explained if DSL ligands sequestered Notch at the membrane, made Notch more sensitive to degradation, or increased the stability of the heterodimer as it travels through the endosomal pathway. As we and others (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fiuza et al., 2010</a>) have shown that increasing or decreasing ligand has variable effects on receptor distribution among tissues, and given that we observe a consistent effect among tissues on Notch activation upon <i>cis</i>-ligand removal, we prefer the stability hypothesis. <a href=\"#bib6\">Fiuza et al. (2010)</a> show that ligand affects Notch stability during Notch activation by EDTA, giving support to the stability hypothesis as the most parsimonious explanation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fiuza et al., 2010</a>). It is suggested that retaining a pool of translated Notch receptor keeps the pathway in a condition capable of almost instant activation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Sprinzak et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, we propose that a role of <i>cis</i>-ligands might be to keep the Notch pathway in a state of readiness by buffering against unintentional stochastic Notch activity resulting from normal processing through the endosomes. Endogenously, this may aid the ability of a cell to mediate future Notch-dependent developmental events that have strict temporal regulation."

All other crosses were kept at 25\u00b0C unless otherwise noted. In lymph gland studies, Grubbs' test was used to identify significant (p &lt; 0.05) outliers, which were omitted from further analyses."

In preparation for transfection 10<sup>6</sup> cells per milliliter were seeded into either 24-well plates or 96-well plates for experiments with or without dsRNA treatment, respectively. Transfections were carried out with Qiagen Effectene (Qiagen, Netherlands) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. Plasmids used for transfection were pMT-Notch<sup>FL</sup> (a gift from Renjie Jiao), pMT-GAL4 (DGRC #1042), pUASt-Ser<sup>del3</sup> (a gift from Robert J Fleming), pMT-Deltex (a gift from Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas), NRE-firefly luciferase (a gift from Sarah Bray), or Renilla luciferase (a gift from Sarah Bray). Aliquots (75 ng for 24-well plates or 50 ng for 96-well plates) of each non-luciferase plasmid were added and, where applicable, 10 ng of each luciferase plasmid. DNA concentration between transfections was kept constant with an empty vector. For experiments without dsRNA treatment, CuSO<sub>4</sub> was added to a concentration of 500 \u00b5M 24 hr after transfection, and cells were assayed 24 hr later. dsRNA was transcribed in vitro using the RiboMAX large-scale RNA production system-T7 kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The following primers were used to amplify genomic DNA taken from a single male fly from the NRE-GFP stock:"

In order to increase the readability by non-<i>Drosophila</i> biologists, we have gone through the manuscript with non-specialists who have helped us to locate areas which may not be clear, and have attempted to clarify these points. For example, we added a figure to show the schematic drawing of oogenesis, which shows where the follicle cells and germline cells are located. We also include a WT wing disc stained with Wg for comparison and label regions of interest on this disc (i.e., Notum region, hinge region, DV boundary, wing pouch) which we refer to in the text."

From the comments, we are not sure whether \u201can immunocytological following\u201d also refer to a pulse-chase experiment (i.e. pulse with NECD antibody then chase for varying amounts of time before fixation and secondary antibody wash), this technique, although it works in the imaginal disc, has not been successful in the follicle cells, which was noted in Yan et al, 2009, <i>Dev Cell</i> 17. We agree with the reviewer that the conclusion we made on cis-inhibition might be too general and too strong. We therefore have reworded this to the following: \u201cTherefore, we propose that a role of <i>cis</i>-ligands could be to keep the Notch pathway in a state of readiness by buffering against unintentional stochastic Notch activity resulting from normal processing through the endosomes.\u201d"
