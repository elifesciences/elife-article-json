The large flight muscles of <i>Drosophila</i> develop from adult muscle progenitor (AMP) cells set-aside embryonically. The thoracic segments are all allotted the same small AMP number, while those associated with the wing-disc proliferate extensively to give rise to over 2500 myoblasts. An initial amplification occurs through symmetric divisions and is followed by a switch to asymmetric divisions in which the AMPs self-renew and generate post-mitotic myoblasts. Notch signaling controls the initial amplification of AMPs, while the switch to asymmetric division additionally requires Wingless, which regulates Numb expression in the AMP lineage. In both cases, the epidermal tissue of the wing imaginal disc acts as a niche expressing the ligands Serrate and Wingless. The disc-associated AMPs are a novel muscle stem cell population that orchestrates the early phases of adult flight muscle development."

Many mature tissues such as colon, prostate, lung, muscle and brain use adult-specific stem cells in tissue maintenance or regeneration (<a href=\"#bib71\">Reya et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Gonzalez, 2007</a>). The molecular mechanisms of regulating stem-cell proliferation have been studied in neural-, intestinal-, hematopoietic- and epithelial-stem cells of vertebrates and invertebrates (<a href=\"#bib86\">Tulina and Matunis, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Ohlstein and Spradling 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Takashima et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Farkas and Hutter, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Reichert, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Homem and Knoblich 2012</a>). The regulation of stem-cell proliferation is usually through signals from a \u2018stem-cell niche\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mandal et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brack et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cordero et al., 2012</a>). Significant progress in understanding these mechanisms of regulation of stem-cell proliferation and self-renewal has been made in <i>Drosophila</i>. For example, in the developing optic lobe, stem cell-like neuroepithelial cells first increase in number through symmetric divisions and are then transformed into so-called neuroblasts which undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions to generate differentiated neurons and glial cells in this part of the brain (<a href=\"#bib57\">Maurange et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Egger et al., 2011</a>).

Myogenesis occurs in two phases; an embryonic one, which makes the muscles required for the larval life (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bate et al., 1991</a>) while a postembryonic phase leads to formation of muscle required for the adult (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fernandes et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Roy and VijayRaghavan, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Sudarsan et al., 2001</a>). The AMPs, lineal derivatives of the mesoderm, are generated embryonically and proliferate postembryonically (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bate et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fernandes et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Roy and VijayRaghavan, 1999</a>). Little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the AMPs proliferate and to give rise to the large number of cells which are needed to contribute to the massive adult flight muscles. During late embryogenesis the AMPs required for the formation of flight muscles are set aside in the mesothoracic segment (T2) and those required for haltere muscle development in the metathoracic segment (T3) (<a href=\"#bib82\">Sudarsan et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib73a\">Roy et al., 1997</a>). The numbers of AMPs at this early stage in T2 and T3 are same but the AMPs in T2 proliferate profusely while those in T3 far less. Studies on the \u2018four-winged-fly\u2019 have clearly shown the key role played by the wing-disc ectoderm in regulating myoblast proliferation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fernandes et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dutta et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib73a\">Roy and VijayRaghavan 1997</a>).

We focus on the AMPs associated with the wing imaginal disc in the second thoracic segment, which give rise to the large indirect flight muscles. We show that an initial amplification of the number of these AMPs occur through symmetric divisions and is followed by a switch to asymmetric divisions, in which the AMPs self-renew and generate postmitotic myoblasts required for the formation of adult myofibers. The sequential nature of these two division modes results in a change in the arrangement of AMP lineages from an initially monostratified layer adjacent to the wing disc epithelium to a markedly multistratified layer comprising both AMPs and their post mitotic myoblast progeny. While the initial amplification of AMPs through symmetric divisions is controlled by Notch signaling, the switch to the subsequent asymmetric division mode of AMP division additionally requires Wingless. In both cases the epidermal tissue of the wing imaginal disc acts as a stem cell niche and provides the ligands, Serrate and Wingless, for the two signaling pathways that operate in the AMPs. We identify the AMPs as a novel muscle stem cell population whose proliferation pattern orchestrates the building of the large flight muscles in <i>Drosophila</i>."

In the thoracic segments of the embryo, each of these progenitor cells divides asymmetrically to generate a muscle founder cell involved in embryonic myogenesis and an AMP which has active Notch (N) signaling and continues to express the mesodermal marker Twist (Twi). In contrast to their muscle founder cell siblings, the AMPs do not differentiate in the embryo; rather they are set aside and at the end of embryonic development become associated with the imaginal discs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bate et al., 1991</a>). The Twi-expressing AMPs associated with the wing imaginal discs co-express Vestigial (Vg) in late embryonic stages (<a href=\"#bib82\">Sudarsan et al., 2001</a>). In the early embryonic stage (Stage11) Wg induced Dll (Distalless) expression leads to separation of the primordium for different discs and those for wing imaginal discs start expressing Vg and results in defining of the population for wing disc primordium (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cohen et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Campos-Ortega, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kubota et al., 2000</a>).

To further characterize the extent of post-embryonic proliferation of the flight-muscle AMPs, we determined the number of Twi-positive cells associated with the T2 wing disc at different larval stages. Immediately after larval hatching (24 hr AEL) a total of 10 (\u00b12) Twi-positive cells were found on the wing disc implying that these had not yet initiated proliferative divisions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). At the late second instar stage (72 hr AEL) the number of Twi-positive cells associated with the wing disc had increased to approximately 250 (\u00b115) and at the late third instar stage (144 hr AEL) approximately 2500 (\u00b190) Twi-positive cells were found on the wing disc indicative of intense proliferative activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>). We conclude that the 10 AMPs present on the wing disc at the end of embryogenesis and the beginning of larval development initiate a proliferation process during subsequent larval stages which results in some 2500 Twi-positive cells at the end of larval development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F,G</a>). These findings suggest that each embryonically born AMP, on the average, would give rise to a lineage of approximately 250 cells during larval development. We next investigated the cellular mechanisms that make this remarkable proliferation possible."

In twin-spot MARCM, heat shock induces a timed mitotic recombination event in the precursor cell which results in differential labeling of its two daughter cell clones with heritable expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in one cell and red fluorescent protein (RFP) in the other. Symmetric cell divisions will result in daughter cell clones of RFP and GFP of equal number of cells; asymmetric clonal amplification should result in daughter cell clones of GFP and RFP of unequal size."

Wing discs containing labeled clones were co-labeled for Twi-immunoreactivity. Twin-spot MARCM clones induced between the early first instar and the late second instar invariably resulted in two relatively large, differentially labeled daughter cell clones that were similar in size and contained a similar number of cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). This indicates that mitotically active cells in the AMP lineages divide symmetrically during early larval development (30 hr\u201372 hr AEL). In contrast, twin-spot MARCM clones induced during larval development from the early third instar (\u223c75 hr AEL) onward always resulted in two differentially labeled daughter cell clones of different number of cells in each clone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>). Notably, one of the two daughter cell clones invariably comprised one large labeled cell with elongated morphology, whereas the other daughter cell clone contained up to 10 (\u00b13) smaller cells. This indicates that mitotically active cells in the AMP lineages have differential clonal potential and divide during the third larval instar stage (72 hr\u2013144 hr AEL), with each stem cell giving rise to one stem cell through self-renewal as well as a sibling cell which could differentiate further."

In the third larval instar stage, these myogenic progenitor cells divide to produces up to 10 progeny to generate a total of approximately 2500 myogenic cells. This division is different from the earlier mode, as the division outcome is asymmetric as the majority of the clone is essentially due to proliferation of the one of the cell.

To determine if mitotic activity takes place in specific layers, cells were co-labeled for phospo-histone-3 (PH3) immunoreactivity and <i>Dmef2-</i>Gal4 was used to drive UAS mCD8::GFP. Throughout larval development, PH3 positive cells were only observed in the cell layer immediately adjacent to the wing disc epithelium. Notably, even in the multistratified organization manifested in the third larval instar, PH3 positive cells were seen only in cells located adjacent to the epithelium and not in cells located in more distal layers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013D\u2033</a>).

Centrosome position and, hence, the axis of cell division were revealed by a GFP-tagged peri-centrosomal (CNN-GFP) label (<a href=\"#bib59\">Megraw et al., 2002</a>) and <i>Dmef2</i>-Gal4 was used to drive UAS-CNN-GFP expression. Throughout the second instar stage, the axis of cell division in the mitotically active cells is oriented parallel to the surface of the wing disc epithelium such that both daughter cells remain in contact with the epithelium (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013H\u2032</a>). In contrast, from early third instar stage onward, the axis of cell division shows an oblique to orthogonal orientation relative to the disc surface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I\u2013L\u2032</a>). Consequently, only one of the two daughter cells remains in contact with the disc epithelium while the other daughter cell loses epithelial contact and, hence, might contribute to the population of cells located in layers distal to the disc epithelium."

For this, we first performed EdU (5-Ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine) incorporation experiments to visualize cells actively engaged in DNA replication as well as their progeny. EdU incorporation was carried out in early third instar larva (in a 5 hr pulse) and visualized in AMP cells on wing discs co-labeled with for Twi immunoreactivity. When cells were examined directly after EdU incorporation (pulse, no chase), labeling was only found in cells adjacent to the disc epithelium (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). This result confirms the finding that mitotically active cells are located next to the epithelium. If the incorporation of EdU was followed by 48 hr without EdU (pulse, chase) and the cells then examined, labeling was seen in all layers. However, in this case, the majority of labeled cells were in the most distal layer, less labeled cells were in an intermediate layer and the lowest number of labeled cells was found in the layer adjacent to the disc (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). This indicates that the pulse of EdU labeling incorporated into the (replicating) cells adjacent to the disc epithelium was now manifest in the (non-replicating) cells located in more distal layers. This, in turn, implies that the cells in the more distal layers are the postmitotic progeny of the proliferating cells that remain in contact with the disc epidermis."

In early larval development (first and second instar), AMPs undergo a marked amplification in cell number through symmetric divisions. These divisions are oriented parallel to the wing disc epithelium and hence the AMPs form a monolayer of proliferating cells that remain in contact with the disc epithelium. In late larval development (third instar) AMPs switch to an asymmetric mode of proliferative cell division in which they self-renew and generate postmitotic daughter cells. These asymmetric divisions are oriented obliquely to the wing disc surface such that the self-renewing daughter cells remain in contact with the disc epithelium while the postmitotic daughters become located in the more distal layer of non-replicating myoblasts."

Wingless (Wg) is a signaling protein that can act to control developmental patterning and growth (<a href=\"#bib79\">Sharma and Chopra, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Zecca et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">van Amerogen and Nusse, 2009</a>). During larval development of the wing disc, Wg is expressed in the prospective wing blade region in all instar stages, however, expression in the prospective notum region, in which the developing AMP lineages reside, is only manifest from the early third instar onwards (<a href=\"#bib67\">Phillips and Whittle, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Tomoyasu et al., 2000</a>). Previous work on postembryonic myogenesis has shown that Wg signaling from this region of the larval wing disc epithelium is involved in elaboration and maintenance of myoblast diversity (<a href=\"#bib82\">Sudarsan et al., 2001</a>)."

Throughout the third instar stage, notal Wg expression is seen in a stripe of epithelial cells that are closely apposed to the adjacent population of Twi positive cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013H</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). To determine if Wg signaling from this spatially restricted stripe of epithelial cells can influence all of the Twi-positive cells in the myogenic layers, we used immunolabeling to visualize beta-catenin activity in wild type vs notal Wg loss-of-function using <i>Wg(ts)/Wg(Sp-1</i>) alleles. In these experiments, notal Wg loss-of-function resulted in complete loss of beta-catenin activity in all Twi-positive cells implying that inductive Wg signaling from the notum region of the wing disc affects all myogenic cells in the third larval instar (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I\u2013N</a>). We next carried out similar Wg loss-of-function experiments together with Nb immunolabeling to investigate if inductive Wg signaling is required for onset and maintenance of Nb expression in the third instar myogenic cells. Wg loss-of-function in the wing disc notum resulted in complete loss of Nb expression in all Twi-positive cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8O\u2013V</a>). We conclude that Wg signaling in the wing disc notum is required for induction and maintenance of Nb expression in the myogenic AMP lineages in the third larval instar stage."

To understand the possible direct link of the induction of Wg signaling and change in the orientation of the cell division, we down regulated Wg using DN-TCF with <i>Dmef2</i>-Gal4 and probed for division axis using CNN-GFP. The axis of the division in this background is parallel to the epithelium, similar to that seen in the early instars (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Wg, in the presumptive notum is expressed only from the late second instar (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexandre et al., 2014</a>), therefore this result shows that down-regulation of Wg prevents the switch in cell-division orientation from parallel to the epithelium to perpendicular to the epithelium. This suggests that Wg signaling from the wing disc niche might have dual effects on neighboring myogenic cells, namely the induction of Nb expression and the regulation of proliferation."

The haltere (T3) disc and the wing (T2) disc, start off with a similar numbers of myoblasts in the late embryo. Studies on muscle development in the \u2018four-winged fly\u2019, where the function of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is removed from the haltere disc, showed that AMP population is controlled by the disc-epidermis. When the haltere ectoderm is transformed to T2 with the AMPs continue to retain a T3 identity, the AMPs nevertheless transform to a T2 population size (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fernandes et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib73a\">Roy et al., 1997</a>). Despite these early studies examining the role of signaling from the disc-ectoderm (<a href=\"#bib82\">Sudarsan et al., 2001</a>) in flight muscle specification (<a href=\"#bib77\">Schnorrer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Sch\u00f6nbauer et al., 2011</a>), the mechanism of population expansion have not been hitherto investigated.

This amplification, where the daughters of each stem are both stem cells, takes place by the division of cells parallel to the disc-epithelium stem-cell niche and requires Ser-N signaling. As the expression of Wg in the presumptive notum known to occur in the late second instar larva (<a href=\"#bib85\">Tomoyasu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alexandre et al., 2014</a>) changes in the AMPs proliferative behaviour are seen. A switch to asymmetric cell- division results in a \u2018self-renewed\u2019 stem cell and a post-mitotic sibling poised to differentiate to contribute to multinucleate muscles. The plane of cell division is no longer parallel to the ectoderm, resulting a stratified layer of cells, with the disc-proximal layer consisting of stem cells."

AMPs initially manifest a symmetric cell division mode, which serves to amplify the progenitor pool in the first and second larval stages, and subsequently transit to an asymmetric cell division mode during the third larval stage during which they self-renew and generate the postmitotic myoblasts required for adult muscle formation. In both steps, signaling is required from the notum region of the wing disc epithelium, which acts as a transient niche. Thus, Ser localized in epithelial cells of the disc is necessary for activation of N signaling in AMPs throughout larval development, and diffusible Wg from the disc epithelial cells in the third larval instar is necessary for the expression of Nb in AMP lineages and, hence, for their transition from symmetric to asymmetric division modes. The idea of epithelium tissue as transient niche for the regulation of proliferation is something similar to that known in intestinal stem cell (<a href=\"#bib56\">Mathur et al., 2010</a>). In this paper authors provide evidence for the role of progeny of ISC progenitor as a very transient signaling center regulating stem cell proliferation via decapentaplegic."

These neuroepithelial cells sequentially transform into neuroblasts, which generate differentiated neural cells of the medulla through asymmetric divisions. This transition from symmetric to asymmetric divisions involves cellular events such as the reorientation of the mitotic spindle and multiple molecular signaling processes including the dynamic regulation of Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib24\">Egger et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2011</a>).

In germline stem cell (GSC) in the ovarioles and testis, the contact of stem cells with the tightly regulate stem cell number and coordinated maturation of the progeny to form gametes.

Remarkably, this is also seen in the culture, suggesting that this is an intrinsic property and not niche dependent.

Each ovariole contains two or three germline stem cells, which are in contact with somatic cells that regulate their establishment, maintenance and differentiation.

Half of the larvae from the 72 hr stage were separated, dissected and processed for immunolabeling in the \u2018no chase\u2019 cohort.

Wing discs were then dissected and processed for immunolabeling studies. In both cohorts, Edu detection was performed according to the Click-iT Edu labeling kit (Invitrogen)."

These cells are set aside during embryogenesis and undergo extensive proliferation in larval development to generate \u223c2500 myoblasts associated with the wing-disc in the mesothoracic segment. They authors show that the AMPs undergo a series of symmetric divisions, regulated by Serrate-Notch signaling, resulting in their expansion. This is followed by a series of asymmetric divisions, regulated by Wg and numb, leading to presumably muscle cells. Their data therefore implicate the epidermal tissue of the wing imaginal disc as a stem cell niche that orchestrates the proliferation and differentiation of the AMPs."

In the wild type, in early instars, the division axis is parallel to the epithelium. In the third instar there is a change in the division axis, effectively perpendicular to the epithelium and the division outcome is asymmetric. We down-regulated Wg function by overexpressing DNTCF and show by using CNN-GFP that the axis of the division in this background is parallel to the epithelium, similar to that seen in the early instars. Wg, in the presumptive notum is expressed only from the late 2<sup>nd</sup> instar (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexandre et al., 2014</a>), therefore this result shows that down-regulation of Wg prevents the switch in cell-division orientation from parallel to the epithelium to perpendicular to the epithelium.
