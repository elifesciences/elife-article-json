Although two gene products mutated in Parkinson\u2019s disease, PINK1, and Parkin have been found to play a central role in triggering mitophagy in mammals, how the pre-autophagosomal isolation membrane selectively and accurately engulfs damaged mitochondria remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that TBC1D15, a mitochondrial Rab GTPase-activating protein (Rab-GAP), governs autophagosome biogenesis and morphology downstream of Parkin activation. To constrain autophagosome morphogenesis to that of the cargo, TBC1D15 inhibits Rab7 activity and associates with both the mitochondria through binding Fis1 and the isolation membrane through the interactions with LC3/GABARAP family members. Another TBC family member TBC1D17, also participates in mitophagy and forms homodimers and heterodimers with TBC1D15. These results demonstrate that TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 mediate proper autophagic encapsulation of mitochondria by regulating Rab7 activity at the interface between mitochondria and isolation membranes."

Although these two pathways share a number of core biochemical steps, the morphology of the isolation membranes can differ greatly. Cup-shaped isolation membranes surround cytosol and organelles upon starvation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baba et al., 1994</a>). However, when large aggregates of debris accumulate or during xenophagy (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kageyama et al., 2011</a>), autophagosomes form locally on the surface of the substrate and grow in contour with the often irregularly shaped structures that can be much larger than the membrane cups formed during starvation. Furthermore, for large aggregates of mitochondria, several autophagosomes may form simultaneously on different sides of the cargo and fuse together to engulf them (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yoshii et al., 2011</a>). Ubiquitinated protein aggregates may be tagged by LIR (LC3-interacting region) domain-containing proteins that bind LC3 family proteins on isolation membranes to help recruit autophagosomes to the debris (<a href=\"#bib5\">Birgisdottir et al., 2013</a>).

As TBC1D15 binds to Fis1 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Onoue et al., 2013</a>) and is a Rab-GAP potentially involved in autophagy (<a href=\"#bib3\">Behrends et al., 2010</a>), we made a <i>TBC1D15</i> gene knock out (KO) cell line using TALENs (Transcription activator-like effector nucleases [<a href=\"#bib12\">Gaj et al., 2013</a>]) and compared the LC3 accumulation phenotype with that of <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> cells. We designed TALEN binding pairs that target exon 9 of the <i>TBC1D15</i> gene because it is shared by all conceivable TBC1D15 splicing isoforms. One <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> clone harbors a 14-bp deletion in one allele and a large deletion in the other allele, both of which are frame-shifting and would cause mRNA decay (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We compared the mitochondrial and peroxisomal morphology of <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells with that of <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i>, <i>MFF\u2212/\u2212</i>, and <i>DRP\u2212/\u2212</i> cells. In agreement with previous work (<a href=\"#bib45\">Otera et al., 2010</a>), mitochondrial morphology, as well as peroxisomal morphology in <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> cells, was similar to that of WT cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In contrast to moderately elongated mitochondria in <i>TBC1D15</i> siRNA-treated cells reported previously (<a href=\"#bib44\">Onoue et al., 2013</a>), complete depletion of TBC1D15 by knock out resulted in no obvious mitochondrial morphology changes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Furthermore, peroxisome shape in <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells was also indistinguishable from that of WT cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In sharp contrast, <i>MFF\u2212/\u2212</i> and <i>DRP\u2212/\u2212</i> cells display elongated mitochondria and peroxisomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating that Mff and Drp1 play important roles in regulating both mitochondria and peroxisome morphology, consistent with the previous findings (<a href=\"#bib54\">Smirnova et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Koch et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek, 2008</a>). Quantification of mitochondrial morphology demonstrated that the fission defect in <i>MFF\u2212/\u2212</i> cells is similar to, but not as strong as, that caused by <i>DRP1</i> deletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Therefore, it appears that both TBC1D15 and Fis1 are dispensable for mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission in human cells."

To assess autophagosomes in the absence of TBC1D15, we made stable cell lines expressing YFP-LC3 and mCherry-Parkin and treated the cells with valinomycin, a potassium ionophore that dissipates mitochondrial inner membrane potential, to trigger Parkin-mediated mitophagy. 3 hr of valinomycin treatment to depolarize mitochondria-stimulated Parkin translocation onto mitochondria with similar efficiencies in all cell lines tested (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). WT cells have several small dots, crescent-shaped, or spherical YFP-LC3 puncta representing isolation membranes and autophagosomes, respectively, that were observed on or near fragmented mitochondria, consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#bib40\">Narendra et al., 2008</a>). However, upon mitophagy induction in <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> cells, YFP-LC3 accumulates excessively in foci, which often appears interconnected with one another, localized on or near mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shen et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells display expanded LC3-labeled structures very similar to those in <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> cells suggesting that Fis1 and TBC1D15 are involved at the same step in autophagy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This phenotype requires both Parkin (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>) and PINK1 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) expression and the loss of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), indicating that it occurs upon mitophagy induction downstream of PINK1-induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria. Expression of N-terminally 3\u00d7FLAG-tagged Fis1 rescued the LC3 accumulation in <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), confirming the effect was caused by the loss of Fis1. Similarly, N-terminally HA-tagged WT TBC1D15 expressed in <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells reverted the excessive LC3 accumulation to that of WT after mitophagy induction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>)."

To examine whether microtubules are important for generating LC3 tubular structures in <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells, we added nocodazole, which interferes with the polymerization of microtubules, together with valinomycin to cells for 3 hr. Although WT cells have similar LC3 puncta with or without nocodazole treatment, LC3-labeled tubular structures and LC3 accumulation in <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells completely disappeared upon nocodazole treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Thus, intact microtubules are essential for LC3-labeled membrane expansion in <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells, a step upstream of autophagosome fusion with lysosomes where previous work indicated dynein-facilitated autophagy (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kimura et al., 2008</a>).

For this purpose, YFP-Parkin stably expressing cells were treated with valinomycin for various times and total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. More endogenous lipidated LC3 (LC3-II) accumulated in <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells as compared to that of WT cells as also seen in <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This is consistent with the greater appearance of YFP-LC3 accumulation by microscopic observation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Although Mfn1, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, was completely degraded within 2 hr in WT, <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> and <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells, ubiquitination of TOMM20, another outer membrane protein was retarded in <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> and <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; TOMM20 asterisk). In WT cells, PINK1 is barely detectable under normal growing conditions because of the degradation through N-end rule pathway (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yamano and Youle, 2013</a>), whereas it accumulates on the outer membrane upon addition of valinomycin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) as seen also with CCCP (<a href=\"#bib35\">Matsuda et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Vives-Bauza et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Narendra et al., 2010b</a>). The accumulated PINK1 starts to decrease after 8 hr of valinomycin likely as mitochondria are eliminated by Parkin-mediated mitophagy. On the other hand, accumulated PINK1 in <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> or <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> was retained longer than in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting, in conjunction with the delayed TOMM20 degradation, that autophagic clearance and/or proteasomal degradation is delayed in <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> or <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells. The rate of degradation of TOMM20, TIMM23, and mitochondrial HSP60 in <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> or <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells, however, was not different as compared to that of WT cells at the 8-hr time points (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). On the other hand, when cells were treated with valinomycin for longer times up to 40 hr, most of the TOMM20 was degraded and protein levels of the matrix HSP60 and the mitochondrial DNA-encoded COXII (MT-COXII) decreased in WT cells, whereas they were retained in <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> and <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). These results indicate that the Fis1-TBC1D15 pair is not essential for mitophagy but the deletion of either impedes clearance of damaged mitochondria, despite the greater magnitude of LC3 accumulation following Parkin translocation. We also found that, although Fis1 is degraded during mitophagy, TBC1D15 escapes the degradation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

Therefore, we assessed if fission defects generally cause LC3 accumulation. The excessively long mitochondria found in <i>MFF\u2212/\u2212</i> or <i>DRP\u2212/\u2212</i> cells are converted from an elongated tubular network to larger, more rounded, or bubble-like structures relative to WT cells upon 3 hr valinomycin treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). However, Parkin translocation and mitochondrial colocalization with YFP-LC3 in <i>MFF\u2212/\u2212</i> and <i>DRP1\u2212/\u2212</i> cells were similar to those in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>) without the LC3 accumulation and/or tubulation seen in <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> and <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These results suggest that LC3 accumulation is a unique feature following the loss of Fis1 or TBC1D15 and is not caused by defects in mitochondrial fission, consistent with the finding that Fis1 and TBC1D15 do not appear to regulate mitochondrial morphology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

                                "text": "The human genome encodes at least 40 different TBC domain-containing proteins. According to phylogenetic and domain analysis of human and mouse TBC proteins (<a href=\"#bib19\">Itoh et al., 2006</a>), TBC1D17 has a high similarity to the primary protein sequence of TBC1D15. Specifically, the region outside the TBC domain comprising 193-312 aa of TBC1D17 is 35% identical (55% positive) to the 201-333 aa region of TBC1D15 that contains the Fis1-interacting region (data not shown), suggesting that TBC1D17 may also interact with Fis1. To test this idea, we expressed HA-tagged TBC1D17 (HA-TBC1D17) with or without Fis1 overexpression in HeLa cells. Overexpressed HA-TBC1D17 alone was cytosolic (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). However, after co-overexpression with Fis1, HA-TBC1D17 localized to mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), indicating that like TBC1D15, TBC1D17 has an ability to bind Fis1. Similar results were obtained by co-immunoprecipitation with YFP-Fis1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Although we were unable to detect endogenous TBC1D17 because no antibody is available, these results suggest that TBC1D17 may also be targeted to mitochondria via an interaction with Fis1. By co-immunoprecipitation, we found that TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 can form homo- and hetero-dimers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Furthermore, the TBC1D15 \u0394221-250 mutant that lacks a Fis1-binding region translocates to mitochondria when co-overexpressed with Fis1 and WT TBC1D15 or WT TBC1D17 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), indicating that TBC1D17 can recruit the mutant TBC1D15 to Fis1 through dimerization. These results are also interesting in light of evidence that Fis1 also forms dimers (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jofuku et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lees et al., 2012</a>) suggesting a new model of Fis1/TBC topology (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>)."

Mitochondrial and peroxisomal morphologies in these cells were indistinguishable from those in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). <i>TBC1D17\u2212/\u2212</i> cells displayed LC3 accumulation during mitophagy similar to, but less severe than that of <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). However, the degree of LC3 accumulation in <i>TBC1D15/TBC1D17</i> DKO cells was not further increased as compared to that of <i>TBC1D15</i> single KO. Therefore, in HCT116 cells, TBC1D15 appears to be dominant for contouring autophagosome morphogenesis. TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 may have different cell type expression profiles or different regulatory mechanisms. Overexpression of either TBC1D15 or TBC1D17 can rescue the LC3 accumulation in <i>TBC1D15/17DKO</i> cells, whereas the TBC1D15 \u0394221-250 mutant cannot (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>).

                                "text": "The absence of TBC1D15 causes the accumulation and/or tubulation of the autophagosome marker, LC3 upon Parkin activation of mitophagy. This would be consistent with Rab-GAP activity of TBC1D15 switching a Rab protein to an inactive form to counterbalance Parkin-induced Rab activation. We hypothesized that the localization of such a Rab-GAP to mitochondria could inhibit Rab activity on one side of the isolation membrane to help contour the membrane expansion to surround the cargo. TBC1D15 may coordinate mitochondrial attachment to pre-autophagosomal membranes with asymmetric inhibition of Rab proteins to guide autophagosomes to tightly engulf mitochondria. Consistent with this hypothesis, several TBC family proteins such as TBC1D25/OATL1 and TBC1D2B have been reported to directly bind Atg8 family proteins (<a href=\"#bib18\">Itoh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Popovic et al., 2012</a>) and TBC1D15 was identified by proteomics to bind Atg8 family members (<a href=\"#bib3\">Behrends et al., 2010</a>). To test this model, we assessed Atg8 family protein interaction with TBC1D15 and sought to identify novel LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs. In mammals, there are at least six different ATG8 homologues including LC3A, LC3B, LC3C, GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2. Both LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies are found on autophagosomal membranes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kabeya et al., 2004</a>). Similar to YFP-LC3B (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), YFP-GABARAPL1 also forms massively expanded structures in <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> and in <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells after Parkin translocation induced by valinomycin treatment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We prepared recombinant GST-tagged Atg8 family proteins and subjected them to in vitro binding assays with cell extracts overexpressing YFP-TBC1D15. While GST alone does not bind YFP-TBC1D15, LC3, and GABARAP subfamily members bind in moderate and high amounts to YFP-TBC1D15, respectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Fis1 cannot bind GABARAPL1, confirming that the binding between TBC1D15 and GABARAPL1 is not mediated indirectly through Fis1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). In general, Atg8 homologues bind through their LDS (LIR docking site) to an LIR motif of a substrate (<a href=\"#bib42\">Noda et al., 2008</a>). We performed more detailed analyses of the mechanism of GABARAPL1 binding to TBC1D15 because the GABARAP subfamily proteins display greater binding than LC3 subfamily members (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). We made a GABARAPL1 LDS mutant by replacing Y49 and L50 with alanines. Although equal amounts of GST-tagged GABARAPL1 WT and LDS mutant were expressed and immunoprecipitated, the LDS mutant failed to bind YFP-TBC1D15 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), indicating that the binding occurs through LIR\u2013LDS interactions. This result was confirmed in binding assays of HA-TBC1D15 and YFP-GABARAPL1 expressed in cultured cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>)."

Based on this consensus motif, we identified 20 different LIR candidates in the TBC1D15 protein sequence (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To narrow down candidates, we made and tested TBC1D15 truncations by in vitro binding assays using GST-tagged GABARAPL1. TBC1D15 was first divided into four parts according to the domain structure; the N-terminus (1\u2013200), a region including the Fis1-interacting site (201-333), the TBC domain (334\u2013557), and a C-terminal region (558\u2013674), all of which were tagged with YFP at the N-terminus for detection by immunoblotting. Transiently overexpressed TBC1D15 domains in HEK293 cells subjected to in vitro binding assays revealed that only the 201\u2013333 region retained the affinity for GABARAPL1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>).

Although little is known about the pairing between various Rab proteins and TBC proteins, in vitro GTPase assays (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>) and pull-down assays in cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Peralta et al., 2010</a>) suggest that TBC1D15 may function as a Rab-GAP for Rab7. Rab7 is required for endosome maturation and transport from the late endosome to the lysosome (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bento et al., 2013</a>). However, Rab7 also has been reported to be involved in the biogenesis of autophagosomes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gutierrez et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jager et al., 2004</a>). We hypothesized that if TBC1D15 bound to Fis1 on mitochondria normally inhibits Rab7 during mitophagy through Rab-GAP activity, the excessive LC3-labeled tubulation observed in <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells (as well as <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> cells) might be a consequence of excessive or unregulated Rab7 activity. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down Rab7 by siRNA. We found 2 of 4 different siRNAs tested could knock down endogenous Rab7 expression efficiently (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). These two Rab7 siRNAs were able to completely suppress the abnormal LC3 accumulation and tubulation in both <i>FIS1\u2212/\u2212</i> or <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and data not shown). We investigated Rab7 localization in WT and <i>TBC1D15\u2212/\u2212</i> cells with or without valinomycin treatment.

Mitochondrial damage is initially signaled to Parkin through the kinase PINK1 (<a href=\"#bib67\">Youle and Narendra, 2011</a>). As PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane of depolarized mitochondria, it recruits Parkin and activates Parkin ubiquitin ligase activity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Iguchi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lazarou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zheng and Hunter, 2013</a>). Parkin then modifies numerous mitochondrial outer membrane proteins with K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains. This ubiquitin signal appears to recruit ULK1, Atg9 and LC3 to the mitochondrion independently of one another to induce mitophagy (<a href=\"#bib17\">Itakura et al., 2012</a>). Our results also indicate that Rab7 is likely activated by a Rab GEF to promote autophagosomal membrane growth and microtubule associated trafficking and that TBC1D15/17 Rab GAP activity is required to temper Rab7 activity to tailor autophagosomal membrane expansion to surround mitochondrial aggregates. Without TBC1D15, or with TBC1D15 lacking Rab GAP activity, LC3/GABARAP-labeled isolation membranes accumulate excessively and without cargo orientation sending long tubules away from mitochondria along microtubule tracks. This suggests that Rab GAP activity localized on the cargo\u2014facing only one side of the expanding LC3 positive isolation membranes\u2014may inhibit Rab7 activity and thereby inhibit membrane expansion proximal to the cargo forcing the growing membrane to tightly wrap odd shaped cargo. Alternatively, perhaps LC3-decorated preautophagosomal structures traffic along microtubules toward Parkin-ubiquitinated mitochondria and fuse together around mitochondrial aggregates where TBC1D15 bound to mitochondria inhibits Rab7 to mediate the release of LC3-bound membranes from microtubules as they contact the mitochondrial cargo (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pankiv et al., 2010</a>)."

Parkin also may activate Rab proteins as a step in xenophagy (<a href=\"#bib33\">Manzanillo et al., 2013</a>)."

Proteins that contain both an LIR domain and a ubiquitin-associated domain such as p62 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bjorkoy et al., 2005</a>), optineurin (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wild et al., 2011</a>), NBR1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kirkin et al., 2009</a>), and NDP52 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Thurston et al., 2009</a>) can bind to LC3 and to polyubiquitin chains to recruit ubiquitinated cargo into nascent isolation membranes. TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 are also LIR domain-containing LC3/GABARAP-binding proteins. However, in contrast to the ubiquitin-binding LIR domain proteins, TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 appear to constitutively bind to mitochondria through Fis1 and thus, unless somehow regulated, would not appear to initiate the recruitment of LC3 to mitochondria. More likely, TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 use LC3/GABARAP binding in the context of Rab GAP activity to orient growing isolation membranes to the surface of the cargo. Interestingly, TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 appear to heterodimerize and homodimerize, which may increase their affinity for LC3/GABARAP by multivalent binding. Fis1 also forms dimers consistent with its role as the TBC1D15/17 receptor. The self association of TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 is shared by other ubiquitin-binding LIR domain proteins such as p62 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Birgisdottir et al., 2013</a>)."

Furthermore, Fis1 loss in <i>C. elegans</i> causes LC3 accumulation and has been linked to stress-induced mitochondrial fission (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shen et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, Dnm1 activity in yeast (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mao et al., 2013</a>), and Drp1 activity in mammalian cells is required for mitophagy (<a href=\"#bib60\">Twig et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tanaka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Frank et al., 2012</a>) suggesting a link with Fis1 in mitophagy. In contrast to human Fis1, yeast Fis1 has an N-terminal extension that folds back into a pocket used by other tetratricopeptide motif proteins to bind ligands (<a href=\"#bib55\">Suzuki et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2005</a>). It will be important to determine how TBC1D15 interacts with human Fis1 and if the Rab GAP-binding activity of human Fis1 is conserved in yeast. Fis1 also localizes to peroxisomes and would be predicted to recruit TBC1D15/17 to peroxisomes as well, suggesting that Fis1 and TBC1D15/17 may also play a role in pexophagy."

However, the nature of this process is unclear. It is possible that the expansion represent dynein-dependent transport of the abnormal mitochondria\u2013autophagosome complex (LC3-positive mitochondria) or its clusters rather than elongation of the isolation membranes. It is even possible that these LC3-positive structures are aggregates/aggresomes of the LC3 protein, which can be formed in a microtubule-dependent manner. To address these issues, (1) the author should observe and compare isolation membrane marker proteins during mitophagy in control, <i>FIS1</i>\n<sup>\n<i>-/-</i>\n</sup> cells, and <i>TBC1D15</i>\n<sup>\n<i>-/-</i>\n</sup> cells, and (2) perform electron microcopy to clarify the nature of the expanded LC3 structures."

As this is one of the main conclusions of this study, it should be more vigorously investigated, for example by quantification of mtDNA and other protein markers."

In particular, at which step mitophagosome formation is blocked is not clearly demonstrated. Again, electron microscopy can distinguish whether membrane formation or fusion is inhibited at an early or late step, or recognition of mitochondria by autophagic membranes is impaired."

We also detected endogenous Atg16L1 that is associated with Atg12-Atg5 complex and serves as an isolation membrane marker.

This is consistent with our model in which TBC1D15 and Rab7 function after Parkin translocation more proximal to isolation membrane expansion or trafficking."

In addition, we saw more alternate types of LC3-labeled membranes in <i>TBC1D15</i>\n<sup>\n<i>-/-</i>\n</sup> cells. Frequently, larger LC3-labeled membrane capsules were found that contained mitochondria and membrane structures that were not identifiable - these may be partially degraded mitochondria, compacted autophagosomal membranes or tubules or other structures. Moreover, YFP-LC3 in <i>TBC1D15</i>\n<sup>\n<i>-/-</i>\n</sup> cells sometimes associates with small diameter membrane structures such as late endosomes localized very close to mitochondria. However, these may connect to isolation membranes out of plane of the EM section.
