Dpp and FGF signaling in the ASP was dependent on components of the planar cell polarity (PCP) system in the disc, and neither Dpp- nor FGF-receiving cytonemes extended over mutant disc cells that lacked them. ASP cytonemes normally navigate through extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of collagen, laminin, Dally and Dally-like (Dlp) proteins that are stratified in layers over the disc cells. However, ECM over PCP mutant cells had reduced levels of laminin, Dally and Dlp, and whereas Dpp-receiving ASP cytonemes navigated in the Dally layer and required Dally (but not Dlp), FGF-receiving ASP cytonemes navigated in the Dlp layer, requiring Dlp (but not Dally). These findings suggest that cytonemes interact directly and specifically with proteins in the stratified ECM."

Further experiments showed that the extracellular matrix between the cells that produce the morphogens and the cells of the air sac primordium is roughly arranged into layers.

This language may be used in most or all metazoan organs. Studies of Drosophila, chick, zebrafish, and cultured human cells show that the signaling proteins that regulate development are transported along actin-based filopodia (cytonemes) and exchange at synapses where the cells that produce them contact the cells that receive and respond to them (<a href=\"#bib54\">Roy et al., 2014</a> and reviewed in <a href=\"#bib36\">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pr\u00f6ls\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2016</a>). The large distances between the source and receiving cells in some of these contexts (as much as 100 \u00b5m in the wing disc and 150 \u00b5m in the chick limb bud) highlights the question that this work investigates - how cytonemes extend to reach their targets."

The cytonemes that mediate the exchange of these proteins contain the Dpp receptor Thickveins (Tkv) or the FGF receptor Breathless (Btl), extending from the basal surface of the ASP cells and synapsing with Dpp- or FGF-producing disc cells, respectively (<a href=\"#bib54\">Roy et al., 2014</a>). The ASP lies underneath the basement membrane that envelops the wing disc (<a href=\"#bib25\">Guha\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009</a>), and although the space they traverse has not been analyzed, it presumably has characteristics of prototypical extracellular matrix (ECM, reviewed in <a href=\"#bib4\">Broadie\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011</a>). The number and distribution of ASP cytonemes depend on the production of Dpp and FGF in the disc and on their respective receptors in the ASP, but it is not known whether the cells between the producing and receiving cells (henceforth called 'intermediate cells') also contribute to cytoneme-mediated signaling. Possible candidates that might have roles in these intermediate cells that we tested include components of the planar cell polarity (PCP) system, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and integrins."

PCP is also manifested in the asymmetric subcellular localization of proteins such as Frizzled (Fz, a seven-pass transmembrane protein), Dishevelled (Dsh) and Diego (Dgo, cytosolic proteins) to one side and Van Gogh (Vang, a four-pass transmembrane protein) and Prickle (Pk, a cytosolic protein) to the other. Fz, Dsh, Dgo, Vang and Pk are constituents of the core PCP pathway in Drosophila, and all are required for planar orientation and polarization.

To investigate whether PCP mutants also affect the cytonemes that interact with the wing disc, we examined ASP morphology in PCP mutant third instar larvae. The ASP grows laterally from the transverse connective (TC) across the disc toward the cells that express FGF, and at the wandering stage (late L3), the ASP extends across the band of Dpp-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). The late L3 ASP has a characteristic narrow proximal stalk, bulbous medial region and rounded distal tip. Many cytonemes emanate from its periphery, with long lateral ones that extend dorsally to the Dpp-expressing disc cells, and the longer ones at the tip that reach postero-laterally to the FGF-expressing disc cells. In <i>pk</i> and <i>Vang</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>)<i>, dachsous (ds</i>) and <i>fat (ft</i>) mutants (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>), and in larvae that express <i>misshapen, dRhoA, drok, dRac1, multiple wing hair,</i> or <i>Leukocyte-antigen-related-like</i> RNAi (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), ASP morphology was abnormal. Although the abnormalities of the <i>pk</i> and <i>Vang</i> mutant ASPs shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E and F</a> are among the most extreme that were observed, all mutant ASPs with these genotypes were abnormal. We do not make inferences about the roles of the genes for which mutant phenotypes were not observed on the screen. We investigated the phenotypes of the <i>pk</i> and <i>Vang</i> mutants further."

These phenotypes implicate Pk and Vang in ASP development but do not distinguish between requirements in ASP cells, in signal-producing disc cells or in the intermediate disc cells over which the cytonemes extend. In order to discriminate between these alternatives, we reduced pk and Vang function by expressing <i>pkRNAi</i> and <i>VangRNAi</i> constructs specifically in tracheal or disc cells. Expression of the RNAi constructs in tracheal cells did not affect either ASP morphology or ASP cytonemes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). In contrast, ASP morphology was abnormal and cytonemes were reduced in number and length when <i>pkRNAi</i> or <i>VangRNAi</i> were expressed in the dorsal region of the wing disc where the ASP is located (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). Similar results were obtained by ectopic over-expression of <i>pk</i> and <i>Vang</i> in the dorsal wing disc (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with previous studies showing that loss- and gain-of-function conditions for <i>pk</i> and other PCP genes have similar effects on planar polarity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adler\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Casal\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Taylor et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Tree et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Vinson and Adler, 1987</a>). Over expression of either <i>fz</i> or <i>fmi</i> had no apparent effect on ASP morphology or development (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Expression of RNAi constructs directed against other genes of the PCP system (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) identified <i>Grunge (Gug</i>) to be another candidate function that is required specifically in disc cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,H</a>). <i>Gug</i> encodes the Drosophila homolog of the Atrophin co-repressor (<a href=\"#bib13\">Erkner et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2002</a>) and has been proposed to function in the Fat/Dachsous arm of the PCP system (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fanto et al., 2003</a>). RNAi directed against several other genes that are required for PCP function (e.g., <i>dRhoA, mwh, Lar</i>) resulted in abnormal ASP phenotypes after expression in either the ASP or disc (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

To monitor Dpp and FGF signaling in the ASP, we used a sensor that generates green fluorescence in cells that actively transduce Dpp (Dad-GFP; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ninov et al., 2010</a>), and an antibody that detects dpERK, which accumulates in cells that actively transduce FGF (<a href=\"#bib50\">Reich\u00a0et\u00a0al., 1999</a>). Under normal conditions, cells in the medial region of the ASP activate Dpp signal transduction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#bib54\">Roy et al., 2014</a>) and cells at the tip activate FGF signal transduction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#bib54\">Roy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</a>). In <i>pk</i> and <i>Vang</i> mutants, Dpp and FGF signal transduction in the ASP were reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C,E,F</a>), confirming the importance of these functions for signaling in the ASP.

Rather, they navigate along, or at some distance from the basal surface of the disc cells, and they presumably encounter the ECM in a manner that has not been defined. We previously observed that the structure of the ECM is sensitive to both increased and reduced Mmp2 expression, and that dis-regulation of Mmp2 reduces ASP growth and signaling and perturbs morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Guha\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009</a>).

We also monitored cell components that localize to either the apical (atypical PKC; aPKC) or basolateral (Discs large; Dlg) compartments (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Whereas cells in mutant <i>Vang</i> clones appeared to retain normal distributions of Dlg, which is consistent with the normal morphological appearance of the columnar disc cells, levels of aPKC were elevated and extended more basally than normal. The apparent downregulation of aPKC by the PCP system, which has been reported previously in studies of the Drosophila eye (<a href=\"#bib9\">Djiane\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005</a>) and wing (<a href=\"#bib30\">Harumoto et al., 2010</a>), indicates that some aspects of the apical/basal polarity are PCP-dependent. We do not know how the amounts of Dally and Dlp protein in the ECM are controlled or how the PCP components Pk and Vang, which concentrate apically, might influence the composition of the basal ECM. Possibly, mutant cells fail to export the HSPGs, fail to retain HSPGs that they or their neighbors make, or do not effectively sort or localize the HSPGs between their apical and basal compartments."

In contrast, loss of Dlp reduced FGF signaling but not Dpp signaling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,I</a>). <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a> presents Rose plots that show the number and orientation of ASP cytonemes in control, <i>dally<sup>80</sup></i>and <i>dlp<sup>A187</sup></i> genotypes. This analysis confirms that whereas cytonemes extended postero-laterally from the ASP tip and along the dorsal/ventral axis from the medial ASP in approximately equal numbers under normal conditions, the dorsal-oriented cytonemes that mediate Dpp signaling were primarily reduced in <i>dally<sup>80</sup></i> mutants and the postero-laterally oriented cytonemes were primarily reduced in <i>dlp<sup>A187</sup></i> mutants.

Simultaneous expression of Tkv:GFP and Btl:Cherry in the ASP marked the Tkv- and Btl-containing cytonemes, and sagittal projections of serial confocal sections (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and frontal sections (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>) of a specimen isolated from an early to mid L3 stage larva showed that these two types of cytonemes are separated in the space over the wing disc: the Tkv-containing cytonemes traverse a region further from the basal surface of the disc than the Btl-containing ones. Both the Tkv-containing and Btl-containing cytonemes extend from the tip at this stage (<a href=\"#bib54\">Roy et al., 2014</a>). Similar preparations imaged to identify Dally and Dlp (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), and laminin, collagen and Dlp (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), showed that these proteins were stratified above the basal surface of the disc epithelium. Collagen was present in a discrete, distal-most layer. Laminin was also most prominent distally but it did not extend as far from the disc surface as collagen. Dally was also prominent distally, but Dally did not extend as far from the disc surface as collagen or laminin. Dlp was most prominent in the region more proximal to the basal surface of the disc epithelium. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a> depicts the distributions of collagen, laminin, Dally and Dlp relative to the location of the Tkv- and Btl-containing cytonemes. The segregation of the Tkv-containing and Btl-containing cytoneme types to separate Dally and Dlp strata and the specific requirements for Dally and Dlp by Tkv-containing and Btl-containing cytonemes establishes the functional importance of ECM stratification."

We tested for their role in the ASP by expressing RNAi constructs, and observed that whereas the ASP developed normally in the presence of <i>scbRNAi</i>, <i>\u03b1PS4RNAi</i>, <i>\u03b1PS5RNAi</i> and <i>\u03b2vRNAi</i> (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>), ASP development was abnormal in the presence of <i>mysRNAi, mewRNAi</i> and <i>ifRNAi</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013D</a>). FGF and Dpp signaling in the ASP were reduced in the presence of <i>mysRNAi, mewRNAi,</i> or <i>ifRNAi</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013L</a>); and relative numbers of cytonemes were also reduced (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8M</a>). Expression of <i>mysRNAi</i> and <i>mewRNAi</i> had no apparent effect on the number of dividing or apoptotic cells, on cell shape or on the ability of ASP cells to activate Dpp signal transduction (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013N</a>). We also examined control and integrin-depleted preparations to determine whether synaptic contacts between the ASP and wing disc are integrin-dependent. We applied the GRASP (GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partner) technique that generates GFP fluorescence specifically at sites of close and stable cell-cell contacts (<a href=\"#bib15\">Feinberg et al., 2008</a>), and that we used previously to mark cytoneme synapses (<a href=\"#bib31\">Huang and Kornberg, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Roy et al., 2014</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> (panels N-Q), GFP fluorescence was visible at the juxtaposition of the ASP and wing disc in controls, but fluorescence was markedly reduced in preparations from animals that expressed <i>mysRNAi</i>. This result is consistent with the reduced numbers of cytonemes in these preparations (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>)."

Its large cells, easy accessibility for visual analysis, dependence on and sensitivity to paracrine signaling, and robust and abundant cytonemes offer many ways to exploit Drosophila\u2019s genetic toolkit. We took advantage of these attributes to address the general question of targeting, asking how ASP cytonemes navigate across the wing disc in order to synapse specifically with cells that express either Dpp or FGF. We focused on the 'intermediate' disc cells that are situated between ASP cells that extend cytonemes and the disc cells they target, and we identified several functions that the intermediate cells must express in order for ASP cytonemes to mediate signaling. The results show that the extracellular environment in which cytonemes navigate is organized and structured and provides essential support that is specific to different cytoneme types."

They also change in response to ectopic over-expression of signaling proteins (<a href=\"#bib25\">Guha\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Roy\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</a>). These properties suggest that cytonemes are dependent on an active targeting mechanism that conceivably might involve: (1) a random search; (2) chemotaxis informed by an attractant; or (3) structural information encoded in their environment. Although the chemotaxis model seems unlikely because cytonemes that deliver signaling proteins orient to receiving cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bischoff et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Callejo et al., 2011</a>), and although the results we report do not rule out a role for random search, our results indicate that the extracellular environment created by intermediate cells is essential and raise the question how cytonemes interact with it."

Polarized rows of laminin have been observed in the basement membrane at the basal surface of follicle cells in the Drosophila ovary (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gutzeit\u00a0et\u00a0al., 1991</a>) that may involve receptor-mediated alignment of the cytoskeleton with the ECM (<a href=\"#bib18\">Frydman and Spradling, 2001</a>). Although the functional link between the PCP system and these processes has not been established and although the possibility remains that the roles of the PCP components in these systems are unrelated to their roles in planar polarity, our working assumption is that axon pathfinding, polarized extensions, directed cell migrations and cytoneme navigation may share a requirement for features in the substrates they encounter that are dependent on cell polarity."

They correlate this with differential localization of these glypicans, and dependent cytonemes, within the extracellular matrix (ecm). They also identify requirements for integrin signaling in cytoneme formation or stability. Their observations are novel and very interesting, and for the most part well supported, but I do have concerns with some of the data."

The authors also report an effect of Vang, but if I understand <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> correctly, fz, dsh, and flamingo had no effect, which would be inconsistent with a role for the core PCP system.

In the Abstract they also suggest that cytoneme extension may be guided by PCP-dependent polarity encoded in or dependent on the ECM. This led me to suppose that they had shown that the core PCP system somehow laid down polarized ECM (comparable to the polarized fibronectin deposits controlled by PCP genes in Xenopus). However, this was misleading, as the link between the PCP system and the ECM is left unclear. The authors show that some PCP genes (Vang and pk) affect cytoneme function, but ultimately this appears to be due to a decrease in overall Dally and Dlp levels. They do not investigate this further, and no polarization of the ECM is shown. Thus the only evidence is for a permissive rather than an instructive role for Vang and Pk.</i>"

This finding is well supported by the data we present and we do not understand why the relative number of figure panels is germane.

The reviewer did not suggest specific experiments to tackle the general questions that we agree are of interest, and it is beyond the scope of this study and peripheral to our immediate goals to undertake a long-term study of the cell biology responsible for cytoneme specificity or for the structure and function of the ECM that answering them would require."
