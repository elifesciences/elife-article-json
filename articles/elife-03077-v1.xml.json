                    "text": "The \u2018ribosomal stress (RS)-p53 pathway\u2019 is triggered by any stressor or genetic alteration that disrupts ribosomal biogenesis, and mediated by several ribosomal proteins (RPs), such as RPL11 and RPL5, which inhibit MDM2 and activate p53. Inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) is a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis and crucial for maintaining cellular guanine deoxy- and ribonucleotide pools needed for DNA and RNA synthesis. It is highly expressed in many malignancies. We previously showed that inhibition of IMPDH2 leads to p53 activation by causing RS. Surprisingly, our current study reveals that Inauzhin (INZ), a novel non-genotoxic p53 activator by inhibiting SIRT1, can also inhibit cellular IMPDH2 activity, and reduce the levels of cellular GTP and GTP-binding nucleostemin that is essential for rRNA processing. Consequently, INZ induces RS and the RPL11/RPL5-MDM2 interaction, activating p53. These results support the new notion that INZ suppresses cancer cell growth by dually targeting SIRT1 and IMPDH2."

                    "text": "The \u2018ribosomal stress (RS)-p53 pathway\u2019 is triggered by any stressor or genetic alteration that disrupts ribosomal biogenesis, and mediated by several ribosomal proteins (RPs), such as RPL11 and RPL5, which inhibit MDM2 and activate p53. Inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) is a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis and crucial for maintaining cellular guanine deoxy- and ribonucleotide pools needed for DNA and RNA synthesis. It is highly expressed in many malignancies. We previously showed that inhibition of IMPDH2 leads to p53 activation by causing RS. Surprisingly, our current study reveals that Inauzhin (INZ), a novel non-genotoxic p53 activator by inhibiting SIRT1, can also inhibit cellular IMPDH2 activity, and reduce the levels of cellular GTP and GTP-binding nucleostemin that is essential for rRNA processing. Consequently, INZ induces RS and the RPL11/RPL5-MDM2 interaction, activating p53. These results support the new notion that INZ suppresses cancer cell growth by dually targeting SIRT1 and IMPDH2."

The tumor suppressor p53 pathway is one such a target because nearly all cancers show defects in this pathway. Approximately 50% of human cancers have mutations in the TP53 gene itself, while the rest of them harbor functionally inactive p53 proteins, because active p53 can trigger cell growth arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, and/or senescence, which are detrimental to cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Vogelstein et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Vousden and Prives, 2009</a>), and impede cell migration, metabolism, and/or angiogenesis. A major mechanism for functional inactivation of p53 is through overexpression of two chief p53 suppressors, MDM2 and MDMX, which work together to inactivate p53 by directly interacting with p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity and mediating its ubiquitin dependent degradation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wade et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Huang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Tollini and Zhang, 2012</a>). This MDM2/MDMX-mediated p53 degradation is also facilitated by SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylase (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vaziri et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cheng et al., 2003</a>). SIRT1 is highly expressed in human cancers due to down regulation of another p53 target tumor suppressor called hypermethylated in cancer-1 (HIC-1) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2005</a>)."

Consequently, INZ induces p53-dependent apoptosis and senescence in various p53-wild type human cancer cells, such as H460, and HCT116 by inducing the expression of p53-dependent transcriptome (<a href=\"#bib19\">Liao et al., 2012</a>). INZ markedly inhibits the growth of H460 or HCT116 xenograft tumors, but is not toxic to normal cells and tissues. Also, INZ sensitizes the anti-cancer effect of cisplatin, doxorubicin, or Nutlin-3 (an MDM2 inhibitor) as tested in xenograft cancer models (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang et al., 2012c</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zhang et al, 2013</a>). Thus, this small molecule presents as a promising contender for a molecule-targeted anti-cancer therapy. Since its discovery, we have optimized INZ (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zhang et al., 2012a</a>) and determined additional cellular proteins that INZ might target via a set of biochemical, proteomic, and cell-based analyses. As detailed below, our study unveils inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) as a novel cellular target of INZ."

The association of INZ with IMPDH2 suggested that INZ might have a similar effect.

This result was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining, as INZ, but not INZ(O), led to apparent decrease of nucleolar NS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This decrease was due to the reduction of NS's half-life from &gt;10 hr to &lt;6 hr, as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, but NS mRNA level did not alter (data not shown).

Consistently, knocking down RPL5 and RPL11 abrogated INZ-induced p21 and MDM2 levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), indicating that RPL5 and RPL11 are required for INZ-induced p53 activation and apoptosis. Also, ribosome profile analysis followed by IB revealed that INZ significantly increases the levels of ribosome-free RPL5 and RPL11 (fractions 1\u201310), whereas it markedly reduces the level of polysomes (fractions 37\u201351) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), suggesting that INZ could suppress ribosome biogenesis and possibly protein translation. All together, these results demonstrate that INZ can activate p53-dependent apoptosis by interfering with ribosome biogenesis through depletion of NS, causing RS, which then induces the release of ribosome-free RPL11 and RPL5 that bind to MDM2 and consequently inhibit its activity toward p53."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>, addition of either GTP or guanosine to cells significantly, though partially, alleviated the INZ induction of p53 level and activity as measured by IB analysis of p53, Puma and cleaved PARP.

Indeed, knockdown of IMPDH2 compromised the GTP depletion by INZ treatment in both p53 wild type and p53 null HCT116 cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Thus, targeting multiple proteins of one or more signaling pathways in cancers is necessary for developing a more effective cancer therapy.

However, dual targeting SIRT1 and IMPDH2 by INZ to activate p53 would offer the first paradigm for anti-cancer drug development. Our studies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1\u20134</a>) together with previously published findings strongly suggest that INZ effectively activates p53 and suppresses tumor growth in a p53-dependent fashion by targeting SIRT1 and IMPDH2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhang et al., 2012b</a>)). This dual targeting strategy could also explain why INZ can still partially activate p53 in IMPDH2 knockdown or GTP-supplemented cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), although the partial impairment of p53 induction could also be due to the inefficiency of completely knockdown IMPDH2 or the possible non-continuous availability of intracellular GTP throughout the experiment."

Ten-step MudPIT was performed using increasing concentrations of ammonium acetate to initiate each step followed by a 100-min gradient of 0\u201380% acetonitrile. All samples were analyzed on a LTQ Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with the dynamic exclusion set to 90 s. The spectra obtained through MudPIT analysis were searched through Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (Thermo Scientific) using SEQUEST as the peptide-spectrum matching algorithm against the Human NCBI 11-22-10 database containing 29,535 protein sequences. In addition to the human proteins, the database also contained \u223c140 common contaminant sequences for proteins such as keratins, BSA, and proteolytic enzymes. Using Proteome Discoverer 1.3, all peptides were required to pass a 2% false discovery threshold. The number of spectra obtained for proteins found to interact with Biotin-INZ was compared to the levels of spectra for those same proteins observed in MOCK and DMSO treatments to ensure that the candidate interacting proteins are detected at levels higher than background."

Now they provide a different mode by which this compound activates p53 and the authors do not try to consolidate these observations with their previous work showing INZ inhibits SIRT1, so we cannot assess the contribution of each activity to the end effect. When does INZ work via SIRT1 and when by inhibiting IMPDH2? Since both SIRT1 and IMPDH2 catalyze NAD+ dependent reactions is there perhaps a common mechanism by which this compound works in cells? The consequences of each function of INZ in terms of p53-independent effects are also not clear. It would be interesting to know whether INZ(O) has also lost SIRT1 inhibitory activity: could the two activities be separated using this compound?"

Is that why the levels of GTP are so dramatically reduced in these cells? Are they similarly reduced in p53 null cell lines? What about normal non-transformed cells? The nature of the interaction between INZ and IMPDH2 remains unclear. Although INZ is implied in the manuscript to inhibit IMPDH2 activity, the RNAi mediated knockdown of IMPDH2 does not replicate the same effects on p53 as INZ treatment. The authors should address this uncertainty and extend the findings on the interaction between the inhibitor and IMPDH2."

It is possible that INZ inhibits SIRT1 and IMPDH2 in a similar fashion, since both of the enzymes utilize NAD as a cofactor. To prove that INZ can target both pathways by inhibiting SIRT1 and IMPDH2 to achieve maximum cell growth inhibition, we performed INZ dose response experiments in HCT116 cells with double knockdown of SIRT1 and IMPDH2.

This could be due to other SIRT1's substrates like p73 as we showed in our previous studies. Although there is the existence of other potential protein targets (that are associated with SIRT1 and IMPDH2) for INZ, our results clearly show that this compound at lower doses specifically triggers p53-dependent apoptosis and suppression of cell proliferation in both cultured and xenograft tumors (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zhang et al 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhang et al 2012b</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang et al 2012c</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">Zhang et al 2013</a>) and data not shown).

Indeed, INZ did directly bind to purified IMPDH2 in biotin-avidin pull down assays (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 2C-D</a>). Although we could pull-down IMPDH2 from cell extracts and observed the direct binding between IMPDH2 and INZ using purified proteins, INZ did not affect IMPDH2 activity using the purified enzyme (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 3B</a>). This discrepancy could be due to differences between the native state of IMPDH2 inside cells and the purified recombinant protein, as the former could include post-translational modifications and/or partner proteins. Another possibility is that as the chemical structure of INZ mimics a nucleoside, it could be phosphorylated by a kinase and the phosphorylated form directly inhibits the activity of IMPDH2 in vivo, as a number of nucleosideanalogues (e.g. ribavirin, mizoribine) are known to inhibit IMPDH2 after being monophosphorylated by cellular kinases (Leyssen et al 2005, Stuyver et al 2002a, Stuyver et al 2002b). Our results also suggest that INZ might not directly bind to the active site of the enzyme. Currently, we have found some interesting proteins pulled down by INZ are associated with IMPDH2 via proteomics analyses and biochemical and cell-based assays, and we have also identified the metabolites of INZ by LC-MS/MS. It is possible these metabolites of INZ and newly identified IMPDH2-binding proteins might play a role in the regulation of IMPDH2 activity by INZ. Apparently, the mechanism underlying INZ inhibition of IMPDH2 is more complex than that for INZ inhibition of SIRT1. However, studying this complex possibility would take us much longer time and generate substantial amounts of data that could be useful for another independent manuscript. Therefore, we hope that this reviewer would allow us to put these studies into our future manuscripts."

This might partially be due to p73 activation by INZ inhibition of SIRT1.

However, we cannot rule out other possibilities, as RPs are essential proteins, and knocking down any of them is potentially able to cause other defects. These experiments are basically designed to test whether RPs are required for INZ-induced activation of the p53 pathway. Thus we assessed the expression of two typical p53 target genes, p21 and MDM2, which indeed demonstrates that RPs are required for INZ-induced p53 activation."

The depletion of IMPDH2 by siRNA is not as great as in the INZ treatment. One reason might be the low efficiency of siRNA, with the siRNA able to partially knockdown IMPDH2. Another reason might be the multiple targets of INZ besides IMPDH2. We also repeated the experiment using two additional siRNA against IMPDH2 from different vendors. Our results clearly showed that the knockdown of IMPDH2 activates p53 in HCT116 cells, although not as great as in the INZ treatment. We also determined the GTP level in IMPDH2 knockdown cells. It is obvious that the knockdown of IMPDH2 reduced GTP levels significantly in both wild type and null p53 cells. However, it was not comparable to INZ treatment, probably because depletion of IMDPH2 expression cannot activate p53 as much as INZ."
