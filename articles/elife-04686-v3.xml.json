                    "text": "Microtubule-based transport by the kinesin motors, powered by ATP hydrolysis, is essential for a wide range of vital processes in eukaryotes. We obtained insight into this process by developing atomic models for no-nucleotide and ATP states of the monomeric kinesin motor domain on microtubules from cryo-EM reconstructions at 5\u20136 \u00c5 resolution. By comparing these models with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin, we infer a mechanistic scheme in which microtubule attachment, mediated by a universally conserved \u2018linchpin\u2019 residue in kinesin (N255), triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and accompanying release of ADP. Binding of ATP re-closes the cleft in a manner that tightly couples to translocation of cargo, via kinesin's \u2018neck linker\u2019 element. These structural transitions are reminiscent of the analogous nucleotide-exchange steps in the myosin and F1-ATPase motors and inform how the two heads of a kinesin dimer \u2018gate\u2019 each other to promote coordinated stepping along microtubules."

We obtained insight into this process by developing atomic models for no-nucleotide and ATP states of the monomeric kinesin motor domain on microtubules from cryo-EM reconstructions at 5\u20136 \u00c5 resolution. By comparing these models with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin, we infer a mechanistic scheme in which microtubule attachment, mediated by a universally conserved \u2018linchpin\u2019 residue in kinesin (N255), triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and accompanying release of ADP. Binding of ATP re-closes the cleft in a manner that tightly couples to translocation of cargo, via kinesin's \u2018neck linker\u2019 element. These structural transitions are reminiscent of the analogous nucleotide-exchange steps in the myosin and F1-ATPase motors and inform how the two heads of a kinesin dimer \u2018gate\u2019 each other to promote coordinated stepping along microtubules."

One group of motor proteins, the kinesins, typically have one end called a motor domain that attaches itself to a microtubule. The other end links to the cargo being carried, and a flexible \u2018neck\u2019 region connects the two ends of the motor protein."

Each step requires one motor domain to alternately tightly associate with, and then release from, a microtubule filament. This alternating cycle is coordinated by kinesin binding to and breaking down a molecule called ATP to form another molecule called ADP, which releases the energy needed for its next step."

This shape change stimulates the release of ADP, freeing up room for a new ATP molecule to bind to the motor domain. Although relatively small, these structural changes produce larger changes in the flexible neck region that enable the individual motor domains within a kinesin pair to co-ordinate their movement and move efficiently. Many previous studies have investigated these shape changes using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, which rapidly freezes samples and allows their structure to be recorded in high detail. However, the small size of the motor domains and their changes in shape means that this technique was not able to reveal the structures in full detail."

Images of motor domains bound to microtubules were made while the motor domain was in one of two different states: not bound to ATP or ADP, or bound to a chemically modified form of ATP that cannot be broken down. Shang et al. then used these images to produce models of the motor domains and compared the models with previously published images. This revealed a cleft in the kinesin motor domain that opens when it attaches to a microtubule. This cleft's \u2018clamshell-like\u2019 opening allows ADP to be released; it then closes when a molecule of ATP binds to it."

During active motility, the dimerized motor domains take alternating, eight nanometer steps toward the microtubule plus end, tracking along single protofilaments (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gennerich and Vale, 2009</a>). Underlying this behavior, each motor domain cycles between conformations that are strongly attached to the microtubule (no-nucleotide and ATP-bound) and ones that are weakly attached (ADP-bound). Additionally, binding of ATP during the microtubule-attached phase of the motor domain causes a structural element called the neck linker (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) to dock along the side of the motor domain in the plus end direction (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rice et al., 1999</a>). The neck linker connects the C-terminus of the motor domain to the stalk, so that docking is accompanied by translocation of the cargo and the partner in the direction of travel. These nucleotide-dependent behaviors are thought to operate together to drive motility and force production."

Kinesin possesses a Walker-type active site architecture, in which one important structural element (the P-loop) coordinates the nucleotide alpha- and beta-phosphates, while two \u2018switch\u2019 loops serve as nucleotide response elements (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kull et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sablin et al., 1996</a>). It has long been suspected that these switch loops act as \u2018gamma phosphate sensors\u2019, transitioning from \u2018open\u2019 to \u2018closed\u2019 conformations in response to ATP. In this type of scheme, closure of the switch loops would propagate across the motor domain via a series of linked allosteric rearrangements in order to dock the neck linker to the motor domain. Moreover, because the switch II loop is N-terminally adjacent to one of kinesin's microtubule-interacting subdomains, sometimes called the switch II cluster, it was further proposed that kinesin could use the same gamma phosphate-sensing mechanism in order to control its microtubule affinity (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vale and Milligan, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kikkawa et al., 2001</a>). Owing to more recent structural findings, however, the preceding ideas are increasingly regarded as incomplete or even incorrect (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sindelar, 2011</a>). A major barrier to further progress in elucidating kinesin's mechanism has been the inability of cryo-EM methods to much exceed nanometer resolution with kinesin-microtubule complexes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sindelar, 2011</a>), making it difficult or impossible to determine which crystal structures of kinesin (if any) correspond to the motor's functionally relevant, microtubule-attached states."

However, it has remained unclear how closely these structures resemble the corresponding state of kinesin when bound to its physiological substrate (an intact microtubule), and structure models for other nucleotide states of microtubule-attached kinesin have remained elusive. These issues have left open the possibility that one or more of kinesin's vital functions may be governed by allosteric pathways not envisioned in the gamma phosphate sensor scheme, possibly involving twisting of the motor's central beta sheet (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hirose et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kull and Endow, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arora et al., 2014</a>).

Related to this observation, it was also shown that the nucleotide affinity of the kinesin motor domain depends on the direction of a load externally applied to the neck linker (<a href=\"#bib51\">Uemura and Ishiwata, 2003</a>). These lines of evidence indicate that kinesin's neck linker may serve as a control lever, \u2018gating\u2019 the affinity for nucleotide depending on whether it points forward (as in a trailing head) or backward (as in a leading head) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Asenjo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gennerich and Vale, 2009</a>). However, the precise nature of this and other proposed gating functions remains under debate (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shastry and Hancock, 2010</a>) and, similar to the monomer mechanism itself, there is little consensus on the structural basis of any type of gating mechanism in dimeric kinesin (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sindelar, 2011</a>)."

Analysis of these structures leads us to infer that kinesin's switch loops, controlled by microtubules, serve as a nucleotide exchange factor while ATP binding docks the neck linker via a clamshell distortion of the active-site nucleotide cleft. The corresponding allosteric pathways deduced from our structures are distinct from prior proposals that originated from X-ray structures of free kinesin or from lower-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions, including a very recent study where the reported resolution was in the \u223c6\u20137 \u00c5 range (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atherton et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, the resulting mechanistic model for the kinesin monomer can be used to explain key aspects of \u2018gating\u2019 between heads of a stepping kinesin dimer and provides a paradigm for future study of other motor proteins such as dynein and myosin, where atomic structures of the motor-filament complex have not yet been determined."

Through the application of recent advances in instrumentation and image processing, including the use of a high-speed electron-counting detector and algorithms to correct for beam-induced sample motion (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2013</a>) (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we were able to obtain a resolution of \u223c5\u20136 \u00c5 in both of these maps (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), a significant increase over previous studies of the kinesin-microtubule complex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sindelar, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Atherton et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Goulet et al., 2014</a>).

Features in the kinesin region of the map, however, appear to be limited to \u223c6 \u00c5 resolution, probably due to distortions of the helical lattice that could not be corrected by our image-processing algorithms. Hence, we filtered our maps to remove all signal beyond 6 \u00c5 resolution before proceeding with the analysis described below. Even after this filtering, both of our cryo-EM maps resolved all beta sheets, alpha helices, and many loops in both kinesin and tubulin as discrete entities. In particular, the paths of the motor's three principal microtubule-binding loops (L8, L11, L12) were directly resolved (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), which substantially aided further analysis."

Two of these subdomains result from dividing the central beta sheet at the junction between the beta strands anchoring the P-loop and the switch II loop (beta-3 and beta-7, respectively). The third subdomain, sometimes called the switch II cluster, contains kinesin's principle microtubule interaction elements including the switch II helix and C-terminally adjacent loop L12 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Woehlke et al., 1997</a>). Because these three subdomains are closely analogous to subdomains that were previously identified in the myosin motor protein, known as the upper 50kD, lower 50kD, and N-terminal subdomains (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sweeney and Houdusse, 2010</a>), we have adopted a similar naming convention in current work."

In contrast, the N-terminal subdomain makes a \u223c22\u00b0 seesaw-like motion atop the lower subdomain (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a> to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>) in response to binding of the ATP. This action carries the neck linker attachment site (at the C-terminus of helix alpha 6) up and away from the lower subdomain, concomitantly forming a cavity and delivering the neck linker into it. Correspondingly, in the ATP analog state, we observed density consistent with a docked conformation of the neck linker, extending towards the microtubule plus end (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), while in the no-nucleotide state the neck linker was evidently disordered (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>), consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rice et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45 bib46\">Sindelar and Downing, 2007, 2010</a>).

Rigid-body fitting experiments using fragments of kinesin X-ray structures indicate that the upper subdomain rotates by much less (\u223c11\u00b0) than the N-terminal subdomain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). Moreover, these fitting experiments indicate that the upper subdomain rotates about an axis that runs directly through the active site, thus predicting that the switch loops (which are anchored in the upper subdomain) would remain largely fixed in space proximal to the switch II helix as the upper subdomain rotates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). Related to this observation, we discovered a striking resemblance in the conformation of the switch II loop before and after binding of the ATP analog (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,F</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Both of our maps exhibit a contact between the switch II loop and switch II helix, coinciding with a pair of hydrogen bonds formed between the backbone of E236 and the side chain of N255 (respectively) in X-ray structures of kinesin's ATP analog-bound state (<a href=\"#bib32\">Parke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gigant et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Proximal to this contact, our maps resolve another contact between the switch II helix and the microtubule surface, corresponding to a hydrogen bond between N255 and M413 of alpha tubulin in the kinesin\u2013tubulin co-complex structure (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gigant et al., 2013</a>). Thus, our maps indicate that the upper and lower domains are pinned down against the microtubule surface by a three-way interaction between the switch II loop, the switch II helix and alpha tubulin during the ATP binding transition."

This movement appears to be a direct consequence of the 22\u00b0 rotation made by the N-terminal subdomain, to which the P-loop is anchored; the rotation translates the P-loop site \u223c4 \u00c5 away from the microtubule surface. Consistent with this interpretation, while the P-loop forms a visible contact with the switch II loop in our ATP analog map (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), a gap appears between these elements in the no-nucleotide map (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In contrast, the P-loop and switch II loop maintain very close contact in ADP-bound X-ray structures of kinesin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). At the same time, however, the switch II loop fails to make close contact with the switch II helix in the ADP-bound X-ray structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Thus, kinesin's tightly microtubule-attached states (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, top panels) are distinguished from the weakly attaching, ADP-bound states (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, bottom panels) by the presence of a gap between the switch II helix and the switch II loop; correspondingly, we will refer to this feature as the \u2018polymer cleft\u2019. Similarly, the presence of a gap between the P-loop and the switch II loop correlates with the absence of bound nucleotide; we will therefore refer to this latter feature as the \u2018nucleotide cleft\u2019. In the microtubule-attached states captured by our cryo-EM maps, the closed polymer cleft holds the upper and lower subdomains together while ATP binding initiates a clamshell-like action between the N-terminal domain and upper/lower subdomain assembly to close the nucleotide cleft."

This calculation employed an all-atom representation with an explicit solvation model, combined with a novel, customized steering potential derived from our cryo-EM maps (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the resulting structure model, the principle conformational change observed is a straightening of the tubulin subunits from the conformation seen in 4HNA in order to accommodate the microtubule lattice (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Despite this change in tubulin, the conformation of kinesin is well conserved (1.08 \u00c5 backbone RMSD with the 4HNA structure for residues 9\u2013333). Some differences with the 4HNA structure are evident at the kinesin-microtubule interface of our simulations (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), but these involve non-conserved side chains that re-orient to form more favorable contacts during the equilibration phase of the simulation (where the backbone conformations of kinesin and tubulin were placed under a strong harmonic constraint, prior to application of the EM steering potential). The MDFF calculation thus indicates that the conformation of kinesin visualized in the 4HNA structure is largely conserved when tubulin is incorporated into the microtubule lattice."

The hydrogen bond partners in this network, which are shared by the 4HNA starting model, extend beyond the switch loops and include not only a universally conserved salt bridge between R203 (switch I) and E236 (switch II), but also several universally conserved residues in the switch II helix (E250, N255) and L7 from the upper subdomain (Y138) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, middle and lower panels). These interactions thus lock the upper and lower subdomains together, defining the closed state of the polymer cleft; the same network also locks the lower domain against the surface of alpha tubulin via a conserved hydrogen bond between N255 and the backbone of M413 from alpha tubulin."

As the P-loop pulls away from the switch loops, a bifurcated hydrogen bond breaks up between T92 at the base of the P-loop and S202/D231 in switches I and II (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). This action substantially perturbs the magnesium binding site, which is primarily formed by T92. A second residue in the P-loop affected by its translation away from the switch loops is K91, which normally coordinates the nucleotide alpha- and beta-phosphate groups. In the nucleotide-free structure, K91 breaks two hydrogen bonds with a pair of backbone carbonyl oxygens within the interior of the P-loop and swivels around to interact with D231 in switch II, replacing the hydrogen bond this latter residue formerly made with T92. In doing so, K91 loses its ability to coordinate the nucleotide alpha- and beta-phosphates. The resulting side chain configuration within the active site of our nucleotide-free kinesin model is strikingly similar to what is seen in X-ray structures of nucleotide-free F1-ATPase and myosin motors, which possess homologous active-site architectures (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, opening of the nucleotide cleft in our no-nucleotide model specifically disrupts the coordination of both nucleotide phosphate and magnesium within the P-loop."

The relative arrangements of the upper and lower domains in the 1BG2 and 1MKJ structures, corresponding to undocked and docked states of the neck linker, closely align with our no-nucleotide and ATP state kinesin models (respectively). We discovered, however, that both the 1BG2 and 1MKJ structures are prohibited from assuming favorable binding orientations on the microtubule surface due to the conformation of residue N255. As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>, the N-terminal coils of the switch II helix are unwound in both ADP-bound structures. Consequently, the peptide backbone at residue N255 would point directly at the H11\u2013H12 loop of alpha tubulin, generating a substantial steric overlap (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,I</a>). Thus, the 1BG2 and 1MKJ conformations appear incapable of strong microtubule attachment, consistent with the weak experimentally observed microtubule affinity of kinesin's ADP state (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rosenfeld et al., 1996</a>)."

While ADP-state crystal structures of kinesin are largely similar in their active-site features to the 1BG2 and 1MKJ structures, some of these exhibit an alpha-helical conformation for N255 and adjacent residues that N-terminally extends the switch II helix. However, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, when these latter conformations of kinesin are placed in a tight-binding orientation on the microtubule (as defined by our no-nucleotide or ATP state models), the N-terminus of the switch II helix projects downward into the microtubule surface, introducing a clash between N255 and the H11-H12 loop of alpha tubulin. A recently solved \u2018near-rigor\u2019 conformation of the KIF14 motor (PDB 4OZQ) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arora et al., 2014</a>), found in a state that binds ADP but not magnesium, partially repairs the clash in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> by re-orienting the switch II helix to nearly the identical position (relative to the upper domain) as seen in our no-nucleotide model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This reorientation of the switch II helix is accompanied by inward movement of the universally conserved R591 side chain (equivalent to R190 in our construct) from loop L7, apparently dislodging S489 from D638 (equivalent to T92 and D231, respectively) to disrupt magnesium coordination (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arora et al., 2014</a>), thus partially mimicking changes observed at the active site of our no-nucleotide structure. However, the side chain of N662 in the 4OZQ structure (equivalent to N255) projects downward toward the microtubule surface, introducing a steric clash with alpha tubulin."

This shift opens the nucleotide cleft and closes the polymer cleft (See also <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) and allows the switch II loop to assume its closed conformation that simultaneously interacts with N255 as well as R203 from switch I. The conformation of the N255 side chain that accompanies closure of the switch II loop is highly constrained by a pair of hydrogen bonds to the backbone of E236, aligning N255 in order to interact with M413 of alpha tubulin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). Thus, closure of the polymer cleft in our no-nucleotide model appears to be closely linked to favorable microtubule interactions by N255. Conversely, as indicated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,I</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>, the open arrangement of the polymer cleft in kinesin's ADP states is evidently inconsistent with tight microtubule attachment, owing to steric interference of N255 and neighboring residues."

In contrast to this expectation, however, we discovered that the degree of end-to-end twisting in both our no-nucleotide model as well as the previously reported \u2018rigor-like\u2019 ADP complex of KIF14 falls within the range observed in other X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin (<a href=\"#media4 media5 media6\">Videos 4\u20136</a>). However, we identified another mode of distortion in our kinesin models, analogous to the action of an archery bow (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#media7 media8\">Videos 7,8</a>), that would couple strong nucleotide binding to elastic strain in the peptide backbone. In the conformation, we identify as \u2018relaxed\u2019, corresponding to the no-nucleotide state, the P-loop withdraws from the switch II loop to open the nucleotide cleft. In order for the P-loop to move back toward switch II and close the nucleotide cleft, the N-terminus of alpha 2 (to which the P-loop attaches) must move with it. However, because the C-terminus of alpha 2 is covalently connected to the opposite end of the beta sheet, movement of the P-loop therefore stretches alpha 2 across the motor domain, simultaneously deforming the plus end tip of the beta sheet (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B,D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a> and <a href=\"#media7 media8\">Videos 7 and 8</a>) as well as the path of alpha 2 itself (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

If the switch loops are open, corresponding to kinesin's detached ADP states, the switch II loop and the P-loop can interact closely with each other, which would secure the closed conformation of the nucleotide cleft (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Alternatively, when the switch loops are closed, closure of the nucleotide cleft is mainly supported by the gamma phosphate group of ATP itself, which introduces a bridge between the P-loop and the switch II loop that would hold these elements together (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In this way, our structure models indicate that tight ADP binding would be an inherent property of detached kinesin, where the switch loops are free to adopt an open conformation. However, closure of the switch loops (as accompanies microtubule attachment in our structure models) eliminates the ability of switch II to latch onto the P-loop, which would thus allow the nucleotide cleft to relax into its open conformation unless gamma phosphate is present."

In effect, this site appears to act as a \u2018linchpin\u2019 that links closure of kinesin's switch loops to interactions at a single site on alpha tubulin (See <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>). A lysine point mutation at the N255 site was previously shown to eliminate coupling between microtubule attachment and motor nucleotide state, allowing kinesin to bind tightly to the microtubule in all nucleotide states (<a href=\"#bib48\">Song and Endow, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yun et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Auerbach and Johnson, 2005</a>).

Based on the structure models presented here, we hypothesized that the N255K mutation uncouples nucleotide- and microtubule-binding functions in kinesin by compromising the ability of this residue to bridge between alpha tubulin and the backbone of E236 (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>), so eliminating communication between the microtubule and the switch loops."

On the other hand, the N255K mutant appears to be incapable of maintaining a fixed orientation on the microtubule surface. We therefore propose that N255 acts as a conformational specificity selector, forcing the switch loops to close once kinesin contacts the microtubule. While the K255 substitution lacks the appropriate geometry to fulfill this selector role, the amino group of K255 would likely form non-specific interactions with the negatively charged microtubule surface. Presumably, flexibility in the resulting contact allows the N255K mutant to maintain affinity for microtubules even when the switch loops are open. However, failure of this mutant to close the switch loops under these conditions would lead to the loss of microtubule-stimulated ADP release and catalysis, consistent with experimental measurements."

This feature has lead to the identification of a novel allosteric pathway mediated by the \u2018linchpin\u2019 residue N255. The mechanism we propose can be summarized as follows (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Upon encountering the microtubule, alpha tubulin engages N255 in order to stabilize the closed conformation of the switch loops. Here, the primary consequence of switch loop closure is to revise the mechanical linkages between kinesin's upper subdomain and the other two subdomains. In the detached ADP state of the motor, the upper subdomain forms a semi-rigid junction with the N-terminal subdomain (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, top panels), via interactions between the open switch II loop and the P-loop. However, upon microtubule attachment the upper domain trades this junction for a new one with the lower subdomain, mediated by the closed switch loops (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, bottom panels). The functional consequences of this change in subdomain connectivity are twofold. First, disengagement of the N-terminal subdomain from the upper subdomain allows the nucleotide cleft to relax into its open state and release ADP. Second, fixing the upper and lower subdomains together introduces a well-defined allosteric pathway between the neck linker and the nucleotide cleft, so that closure of the nucleotide cleft by ATP becomes energetically coupled to docking of the neck linker."

It is commonly proposed that ATP binding in kinesin would trigger a substantial rearrangement (or \u2018closure\u2019) of the universally conserved core segments of the switch I and II loops (DLAGSE, residues 231\u2013236 and SSRSH, residues 201\u2013205, respectively), accompanied by the formation of a catalytically activating salt bridge between E236 and R203 in switch I (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sablin et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Vale and Milligan, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kull and Endow, 2013</a>). The current results, however, suggest that these rearrangements are largely complete upon microtubule attachment even prior to ATP binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and serve as an allosteric trigger for ADP release by detaching the switch II loop from the P-loop (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Despite these rearrangements by switch I and switch II, the resulting no-nucleotide conformation of kinesin fails to attain its catalytically competent conformation, owing to relaxation of the nucleotide cleft into its \u2018open\u2019 state in which the P-loop withdraws from the switch loops. Only following ATP binding, when the nucleotide cleft re-closes, does kinesin attain its catalytically active configuration. These features of our structure models imply that the primary functional role of switch loop closure in kinesin is not to sense the gamma phosphate as was widely thought, but rather to dissociate ADP."

In G proteins, binding of GTP typically transitions the switch loops from extended (and often partially disordered) conformations to ones that tightly coordinate the gamma phosphate, in order to modulate the binding affinity of various allosteric partner proteins (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</a>). This behavior appears to be partially conserved in our microtubule-complexed models of kinesin, as reflected by a \u2018pincer-like\u2019 closure of loops L9 and L11 that contain switch I and switch II (respectively) and increased ordering of loop L9 that accompanies the ATP binding step (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,F</a> and also <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). However, these changes in L9 and L11 are mainly limited to the non-conserved segments peripheral to the core switch loops and appear to have limited functional importance (see below), while the conserved switch regions remain locked in place via microtubule interactions of the N255 \u2018linchpin\u2019 residue (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Hence, in kinesin the switch loops appear to play a more passive role in gamma-phosphate sensing than in G proteins. Instead, our data indicate that the major allosteric transition triggered by ATP binding is closure of kinesin's nucleotide cleft, accompanied by large-scale distortion of the peptide backbone including the central beta sheet. This latter mode of gamma-phosphate sensing, while not evident in the mechanism of G proteins, is characteristic of numerous other families of ATPase motors that utilize Walker motifs; these families include the ATP synthases (<a href=\"#bib29\">Menz et al., 2001</a>), RNA and DNA helicases (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yang, 2010</a>), as well as myosin (see below). The emergent theme of active site cleft closure in these diverse motor protein families may reflect the need to couple the energy of nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis to large-scale domain motions necessary for mechanical energy transduction."

The structure models presented in that study are superficially similar to the ones identified in the current work, in that a \u2018closed\u2019 conformation of the switch loops was also identified in both no-nucleotide and ATP analog-bound states. However, the no-nucleotide conformation proposed by Atherton et al. seems to exhibit neither an open nucleotide cleft (as defined in the current work) nor twisting between the N-terminal and upper subdomains, both of which are signature traits of our no-nucleotide model. Consequently, the mechanistic scheme proposed by Atherton et al. is starkly different from the one summarized in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>. For example, in contrast to the ADP release mechanism proposed here, Atherton et al. suggest that closure of the switch I loop triggers ADP release by loosening interactions between this loop and a \u2018cap\u2019 of structured water molecules that coordinate the active-site magnesium cation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nitta et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Atherton et al., 2014</a>). Notably, however, interactions between the switch I loop and the water cap are quite variable in X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin and are usually indirect, mediated by at least one other water molecule. It is therefore not obvious that these kinds of interactions would be sufficiently specific to account for the substantial loss of ADP affinity that occurs with microtubule attachment (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hackney, 1988</a>)."

Atherton et al. propose that ATP binding actuates seesaw-like tilting of kinesin's central beta sheet via a pincer-like movement of the switch I loop and switch II loops toward each other. In our models, however, the switch loops mainly serve to anchor the lower half of the nucleotide cleft in place against the microtubule surface (via the closed hydrogen bond network, anchored by the N255 linchpin residue), while seesaw-like motion by the upper half of the nucleotide cleft (composed of the N-terminal subdomain) translates the P-loop down towards the switch loops. In our models, therefore, pincer-like motion of L9 and L11 can be likened to the action of a baseball glove: these loops come towards each other in order to \u2018catch\u2019 the gamma phosphate as the P-loop delivers ATP into them."

The improved resolution of the cryo-EM maps presented here (5\u20136 \u00c5 vs 6\u20137 \u00c5 in the Atherton et al. study) allows us to resolve the distinctive hooked shape of the P-loop in the no-nucleotide map, precisely defining its position with respect to the switch II loop and thus contributing to our identification of an open conformation of the nucleotide cleft (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> of the current work with <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> in Atherton et al.). Moreover, the simulation method used here to develop all-atom models places more emphasis on a chemically realistic simulation potential, by incorporating explicitly represented solvent molecules and keeping the magnitude of the perturbing cryo-EM potential as small as possible (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In contrast, Atherton et al. subdivided their starting models into smaller fragments, fit these as rigid bodies into their cryo-EM maps, and subsequently performed simulated annealing with an implicit solvent model. It therefore seems likely that lower resolution, different refinement methods, and also the use of additional a priori assumptions (i.e., fragment selection for the rigid-body fitting) in the methods of the Atherton et al. study may have impeded their identification of an open arrangement of the nucleotide cleft, in their no-nucleotide model."

Speculations in this regard have mainly focused on the possibility, by analogy to myosin, that release of nucleotide initiates a much larger end-to-end twist in the sheet than is observed in comparisons of nucleotide-bound X-ray structures of the motor (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gigant et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kull and Endow, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arora et al., 2014</a>). However, it has remained unclear how such twisting would relate to the complex interplay of affinities between kinesin and microtubules, ADP and ATP. The structure models derived in the current study indicate that in kinesin, the energy of nucleotide binding is captured by a related but distinct mode of distortion in the peptide backbone, involving coordinated rearrangements of the beta sheet and alpha 2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). As we have shown, this distortion is coupled with closure of the nucleotide cleft and can evidently be stabilized either by interactions between the P-loop and the open switch II loop (ADP state; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>), or between the gamma phosphate and the closed switch loops (ATP state; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). This mechanism would thus allow microtubules to regulate kinesin's affinities for ADP and ATP by modulating the conformation of the switch loops, yielding an elegant structural basis for kinesin's nucleotide-binding behavior on and off microtubules."

The nucleotide-exchange mechanism proposed here predicts that the uncoupling mutations in the kinesin's switch regions would have differential effects on the kinetics of ADP release, depending on the nature of the affected site. For example, due to its apparent role in stabilizing the nucleotide cleft in the detached motor (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), perturbation of the E236 site would be expected to produce a comparatively large effect in kinesin's detached state, by destabilizing closure of the nucleotide cleft and increasing the ADP off rate. In contrast, mutation at the N255 site is not expected to produce a large effect in the detached motor but is expected to drastically attenuate microtubule-stimulated ADP release by compromising the \u2018linchpin\u2019 function of this residue. Both of these predictions are supported by kinetics measurements reported here and elsewhere, which reveal that the N255K mutation reduces the rate of microtubule-stimulated ADP release by up to 1000-fold, to near basal levels (<a href=\"#bib5\">Auerbach and Johnson, 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>), while the E236A mutation increases the ADP off-rate of detached kinesin by 100-fold (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rice et al., 1999</a>) but does not significantly alter the rate of microtubule-stimulated ADP release. X-ray studies of the corresponding point mutants in KAR3 kinesin, co-complexed with ADP and magnesium, also support our interpretation. The structure of the KAR3 E631A mutant (equivalent to E236A) confirms that the mutated side chain can no longer interact strongly with the P-loop (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yun et al., 2001</a>), supplying an explanation for the increased ADP off rate in the detached state of this mutant. In contrast, the structure of KAR3 N650K (equivalent to N255K) was found to be essentially identical to that of wild-type ADP complex (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yun et al., 2001</a>), consistent with our proposal that the dominant functional effect originates in the microtubule complex rather than the detached state, for this latter mutant."

When both heads are attached to the microtubule in their tight-binding states, the neck linker of the trailing head is constrained in an arrangement that favors docking, thus tending to keep the docking cleft open (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, state 1). In contrast, the neck linker in the leading head is kept out of its docking cleft, thus favoring closure of the cleft. Thus, in the trailing head, tight coupling between the docking cleft and the nucleotide cleft (generated by the closed conformation of the switch loops) keeps the nucleotide cleft closed. Meanwhile, the same coupling pathway keeps the nucleotide cleft open in the leading head\u2014weakening the nucleotide affinity and thus disfavoring the binding and/or hydrolysis of ATP."

At this point in the cycle, it appears that the neck linker would serve an important role as an allosteric modulator. If the neck linker were to be undocked following phosphate release, the trailing head would be free to revert to its previous conformation in the ATPase cycle (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, lower left) and release ADP. However, if a forward step has occurred as depicted in states 1\u20132, the neck linker in the trailing head will continue to be held in a docked conformation and the only recourse to relieve strain at the active site is to open the switch loops, hence opening the polymer cleft. The resulting ADP state of the trailing head thus favors tight nucleotide binding and weak microtubule affinity-promoting detachment from (and discouraging subsequent reattachment to) the trailing microtubule site (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, state 3). Importantly, binding of ATP in the leading head at this point in the cycle (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, step 4) promotes a forward step by the trailing head through docking of the neck linker but does not prevent a backward step because neck linker docking is only weakly supported in the motor's ATP state (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rice et al., 2003</a>). Thus, the properties just described for the ADP-bound trailing head are likely critical in preventing back-stepping, which is a key determinant of efficient and rapid motility."

While the structural basis of myosin's filament-attached power stroke is not well understood, it has been proposed that the corresponding lever-arm movement is coupled to progressive relaxation of the central beta sheet (corresponding to increasing degrees of twist) that would accompany catalysis and/or product release (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coureux et al., 2004</a>). This proposal mirrors the sequence of events we infer for kinesin, where the magnitude of the peptide backbone distortion appears to be greatest in the ATP state, less for the ADP states, and least of all for the no-nucleotide conformation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C-F</a>). A recent modeling study has also suggested that interactions with actin could lock myosin's switch I and switch II loops stably together while the P-loop moves with respect to them during the filament-attached power stroke (<a href=\"#bib36\">Preller and Holmes, 2013</a>); this behavior would be directly analogous to the behavior of microtubule-attached kinesin in the currently proposed scheme."

In this light, it is worth noting that the \u2018linchpin\u2019 N255 residue in kinesin is conserved in myosin, but interacts natively with a conserved tyrosine found within the lower 50kD domain of myosin itself, rather than interacting with the filament as occurs with kinesin. Consequently, in myosin this asparagine holds the switch II loop near its \u2018closed\u2019 conformation even in the absence of actin, which could help explain why myosin, unlike kinesin, shows strong catalytic activity even in the absence of its partner filament (<a href=\"#bib12\">Geeves and Holmes, 2005</a>). We anticipate that future studies of both kinesin and myosin will shed more light on the relationship between these intriguing molecular machines."

Reference alignment was used to determine the position of the microtubule seam on a per-microtubule basis as described (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</a>), as was the filament polarity, and then every segment was subjected to local refinement using the established seam orientation and polarity. Evidently due to disorder in the N255K kinesin head orientations, the correlation scores used to identify the seam orientation were far noisier for this mutant. Following initial refinement of the Euler angles and shifts for each box, the estimated position of each 8 nm repeat of the microtubule was mapped back onto the micrograph and a new stack of boxes was extracted for a final round of SPIDER refinement. Thus, the final data set included exactly one box for each 8 nm repeat identified in the selected microtubules. Subsequent structure refinement and 3D reconstruction was performed using the FREALIGN package (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grigorieff, 2007</a>) with specific modifications for helical image processing (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alushin et al., 2010</a>)."

For each reconstruction, 13- or 14-fold pseudo-helical symmetry was applied in order to transform all imaged asymmetric subunits onto a single \u2018good\u2019 protofilament, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</a>). Helical parameters were derived from the corresponding, canonical microtubule form (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chr\u00e9tien and Wade, 1991</a>) but adapted for the measured axial repeat distance in our data sets. The reconstructed \u2018good\u2019 protofilament (along with the remainder of the reconstruction) was subsequently replicated and transformed 13 or 14 times using the same symmetry parameters in order to generate protofilament models for the entire microtubule. The transformed \u2018good\u2019 protofilaments were subsequently selected by complementary wedge-shaped masks and summed in order to obtain the final asymmetric microtubule model. To reduce the influence of solvent noise in the refinement, a tight mask around the protein density was generated from a thresholded low-resolution version of the current map, and then smoothed with a soft Gaussian filter (\u223c10 \u00c5 half-width).

Version 1.91 of NAMD was used for all molecular dynamics calculations (<a href=\"#bib35\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>). We used an explicit solvation model (TIP3P), because conformational instabilities were observed in trial simulations that used a less expensive continuum solvent model. All simulations were run using periodic boundary conditions, but no attempt was made to model the longitudinal or lateral interfaces of tubulin. While this omission likely produced artifacts near the boundaries between the simulated tubulin heterodimer and neighboring tubulin subunits, these boundaries are remote from the motor\u2013microtubule interface. Moreover, the EM steering potential used in these simulations conformation strongly clamps the conformation of tubulin. Thus, our simulation setup is expected to minimize or eliminate the propagation of any boundary artifacts toward kinesin and its interface with tubulin, which is the focus of the current study."

Importantly, we limited the influence of the EM steering potential to include only protein backbone atoms and nucleotide ligands. Thus, side chain atoms in our MDFF simulations are subjected exclusively to physics-based force field terms, which is reasonable because side chains were not visualized in our maps. Related to this point, as noted in the main text, a low-pass filter was used to remove signal beyond 6 \u00c5 resolution in the cryo-EM map, in order to reduce the level of contaminating noise prior to generating the EM steering potential. Limiting the EM steering potential to backbone atoms tends to moderate the contribution of the EM term in the simulated energy function, thus compensating for the limited number of experimental constraints available from our cryo-EM maps."

If the value of \u03be is too low, it will not force a conformational transition within an achievable amount of simulation time; on the other hand, if the value is too high the molecular conformation becomes distorted (\u2018overfitting\u2019). However, a quantitative method for choosing an appropriate value for the \u03be parameter has not been presented. To address this problem, we developed a modified MDFF protocol in which the value of \u03be follows a linear ramp function, starting at zero and slowly increasing over the course of 10 nanoseconds.

This initial transition is followed by a gradual increase in the reported backbone RMSD values in both kinesin and tubulin that continues to the end of the simulation (GSCALE = 1.0). Inspection of the simulation trajectory reveals that the initial transition mainly consists of a straightening of the tubulin subunits from the conformation seen in 4HNA in order to accommodate the microtubule lattice. This transition is essentially complete after 1 ns of simulation time (see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

A prominent example is loop L9 from kinesin, which encloses the nucleotide pocket and includes the switch I motif. In the starting model, a network of hydrogen bonds supports the structure of this loop; however, by the end of the simulation many of these interactions are lost as the loop is increasingly \u2018squeezed\u2019 into the corresponding density feature (results not shown). We note that the path of the protein backbone is not directly resolved this region of our density map, which means that the corresponding EM potential tends to uniformly pull backbone atoms toward the center of the loop feature (where density values are highest), and thus away from their true path. Disruption of L9 (and other secondary structure elements) in the latter parts of the ATP-state MDFF simulation is therefore likely due to over-fitting as the EM steering term increasingly predominates over the other energy terms in the simulated potential. We also note that the conformation of kinesin's N-terminal segment (residues 1\u20138), termed the neck cover strand (<a href=\"#bib21\">Khalil et al., 2008</a>), is unstable even in early time points of the MDFF simulation, possibly due to weak density for both this element as well as the neck linker in the cryo-EM map. Limited occupancy of the docked neck linker is in fact expected under the experimental conditions used here (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rice et al., 2003</a>). In order to minimize the presence of over-fitting artifacts in our final structure model, we selected an early time point (t = 1.2 ns) that immediately follows the initial transition, in order to represent the ATP-bound kinesin-microtubule complex (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

The behavior of tubulin in this trajectory, as reflected by the backbone RMSD from the starting structure, was also very similar to that seen in the ATP trajectory. The backbone RMSD values for kinesin, however, were much greater in the no-nucleotide trajectory, reflecting a significant conformational rearrangement. As described in the main text (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), the primary structural changes in kinesin were twisting of the N-terminal, upper, and lower subdomains with respect to each other, followed by separation of the P-loop from the switch II loop and attendant reorientation of the K91 side chain. The subdomain twisting movement was completed somewhat before the P-loop fully separated from the switch II loop, resulting in elongation of the P-loop as well as distortion of the closed switch loop network prior to the separation. After these elements had separated, however, they both \u2018snapped\u2019 back to conformations that resembled those seen in the starting model (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Similar to the behavior of tubulin in our simulations of both nucleotide states, the kinesin transition was largely complete by 1 ns, as reflected by the backbone RMSD from the starting structure (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) as well as the observed interactions in the atomic model itself (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). As with the ATP-state model, we therefore sought to avoid overfitting artifacts by selecting a trajectory frame immediately following the rapid transition (t = 1.4 ns) to represent the conformation of no-nucleotide, microtubule-complexed kinesin found in our maps. Generally, the agreement between the resulting atomic model and the cryo-EM map is excellent. The only obvious discrepancy between the map and the model is found in the vicinity of residues \u223c195\u2013200 at the tip of L9, which forms part of the switch I response element. In this region, a substantial reduction in the average density of the no-nucleotide cryo-EM map indicates the presence of disorder. Consistent with this interpretation, we observed a corresponding increase in conformational fluctuations at the tip of L9 in a follow-up molecular dynamics simulation where the cryo-EM potential was turned off (See below), while the remainder of the active site remained firmly locked in place (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>)."

Thus the crystal structure of ATP-kinesin complexed with a tubulin heterodimer has now been proved to adequately represent kinesin bound to a MT. This suggests that the crystal structure of apo-kinesin complexed with tubulin will be equally relevant and avoid the daunting task of pushing the EM data to even higher resolution."

                    "text": "This paper presents results of a cryo-electron microscopy study of kinesin-decorated microtubules in two nucleotide states. It advances our understanding of the mechanics of kinesin by providing improved data on the conformations in these states and insights on the transitions between them. This paper follows the recent publication of a closely related study by Atherton et al. in <i>eLife</i> a few weeks ago. These papers used essentially the same techniques and reach nearly the same resolution, which sets the limit to how much can be interpreted from the EM data. This is an incremental improvement in resolution over previously published results, but in both cases new features and mechanisms can be identified from the resultant density maps and differences among them. The nominal resolution in Atherton et al is reported as 6-7 \u00c5 and in the current work 5-6 \u00c5. Although both sets of density maps were filtered to around 6 \u00c5, and the maps are presented at different threshold levels, it does appear that Shang et al do have sufficiently better resolution to justify their confidence in interpreting some important loop conformations. The authors were also able to do a more extensive fitting of atomic models based on their maps. The two papers do come to some of the same conclusions, but differ in significant ways with regard to the loops and the core beta sheet, and these differences have substantial impact of mechanistic models. Shang et al suggests a more complicated domain structure than has been seen before, with identification of a \u201cpolymer cleft\u201d in the microtubule interface region. The beta sheet appears to be strained rather than just twisted, which may relate to the mystery of where the energy of ATP hydrolysis goes. Perhaps most importantly, the new maps indicate that movement of the P-loop is more significant than opening or closing of the switch-I/switch-II region for nucleotide binding and release."

The conclusions are well supported by the experimental results, which include mutation of the critical N255 residue as well as application of molecular dynamics in building the atomic models. The instability of the simulations over long times could be a concern, but does not bother me in the present context. The correspondence with myosin activity in this paper extends ideas presented earlier by Dr. Sindelar and provides further support for the functional models presented here, although further work at higher resolution will be required to validate these proposals. In terms of validation tests suggested recently by Henderson and others, I am comfortable that this work meets standards of acceptance."

Thus, even in our data, kinesin\u2019s switch loops retain a \u2018G-protein like\u2019 character which could even be greater at room temperature, as compared to the frozen specimens imaged here. We have removed the original discussion paragraph on this topic and added two new paragraphs. We soften the claim of \u2018divergence\u2019 from G-proteins, and instead emphasize the new parallels identified with other Walker-containing motors such as DNA/RNA helicases, F1-Atpase and myosin where a cleft is apparently used to store energy in response to nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis."
