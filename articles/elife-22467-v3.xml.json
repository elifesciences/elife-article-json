Here we identify miRNAs that are up-regulated in the rodent hippocampus upon contextual fear-conditioning and identify the vesicular transport and synaptogenesis pathways as the major targets of the fear-induced miRNAs. We demonstrate that miR-153, a member of this group, inhibits the expression of key components of the vesicular transport machinery, and down-regulates Glutamate receptor A1 trafficking and neurotransmitter release. MiR-153 expression is specifically induced during LTP induction in hippocampal slices and its knockdown in the hippocampus of adult mice results in enhanced fear memory. Our results suggest that miR-153, and possibly other fear-induced miRNAs, act as components of a negative feedback loop that blocks neuronal hyperactivity at least partly through the inhibition of the vesicular transport pathway."

Here we identify miRNAs that are up-regulated in the rodent hippocampus upon contextual fear-conditioning and identify the vesicular transport and synaptogenesis pathways as the major targets of the fear-induced miRNAs. We demonstrate that miR-153, a member of this group, inhibits the expression of key components of the vesicular transport machinery, and down-regulates Glutamate receptor A1 trafficking and neurotransmitter release. MiR-153 expression is specifically induced during LTP induction in hippocampal slices and its knockdown in the hippocampus of adult mice results in enhanced fear memory. Our results suggest that miR-153, and possibly other fear-induced miRNAs, act as components of a negative feedback loop that blocks neuronal hyperactivity at least partly through the inhibition of the vesicular transport pathway."

At the cellular level, sensory experience results in altered neurotransmitter release at the synapse, which triggers membrane depolarization and calcium influx into individual neurons. This action initiates a cascade of downstream events including the activation of protein kinases, redistribution of neurotransmitter receptors, and induction of changes in gene expression, which together lead to stable changes in synaptic strength (<a href=\"#bib23\">Flavell and Greenberg, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Malinow and Malenka, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</a>).

The role of de novo transcription and the functions of several families of transcription factors such as CREB, C/EBP\u03b2, Egr1, AP1, and Rel1 in synaptic plasticity and memory formation have been extensively studied (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alberini and Kandel, 2015</a>). On the other hand, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a major class of regulators that act at the post-transcriptional level and control the expression of numerous target genes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bartel, 2009</a>). Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in mammalian genomes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bartel, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lewis et al., 2003</a>), many of which are expressed in neurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bartel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gaidatzis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Krek et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lim et al., 2005</a>). Neuronal miRNAs play major roles in regulation of synaptic development and plasticity, and have been identified as components of regulatory pathways that modulate memory formation (<a href=\"#bib66\">McNeill and Van Vactor, 2012</a>). For example, mouse miR-134 inhibits the expression of CREB, a key transcriptional regulator of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, and modulates synapse morphology by inhibiting the expression of LimK1 protein kinase (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Schratt et al., 2006</a>)."

In one study, distinct populations of miRNAs that are up-regulated in the CA1 region of the hippocampus at early (1\u20133 hr) and late (24 hr) times after contextual fear-conditioning were identified and were proposed to positively regulate memory formation by increasing protein synthesis through de-repression of mTOR activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kye et al., 2011</a>). In another study, miR-132 was found to be upregulated in the hippocampus upon induction of seizure or contextual fear-conditioning 45 min after training (<a href=\"#bib73\">Nudelman et al., 2010</a>). However, the precise roles of activity-induced miRNAs in the hippocampus in vivo remain to be elucidated. Multiple hippocampal regions, in addition to the CA1, have been identified with the acquisition of different types of associative learning (<a href=\"#bib67\">Milner et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Rempel-Clower et al., 1996</a>). Studies using selective lesions within the hippocampus have demonstrated that all of the hippocampal regions participate in memory formation following a period of associative learning (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jerman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kubik et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lee and Kesner, 2004a</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2004b</a>). The hippocampal regions with roles in the\u00a0formation of memory associated with contextual fear conditioning are highly interconnected and may have distinct functions during memory formation. However, previous studies have not analyzed fear\u00a0conditioning-induced changes in miRNA levels in the dentate gyrus region, which is also critical for the formation of memories associated with contextual fear conditioning."

Using a global expression profiling approach, we identified 21 miRNAs that are upregulated in the hippocampus of adult rats 24 hr after contextual fear conditioning. Four of these miRNAs are specifically induced as a result of associative learning and 12 are predicted to downregulate targets that are involved in vesicle exocytosis and synaptic plasticity processes. One of the miRNAs belonging to both above categories, miR-153, is transcriptionally induced, specifically in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, after contextual fear conditioning. We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to determine the role of miR-153 in both synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation. Consistent with its induction pattern in vivo, in hippocampal brain slices miR-153 is specifically induced upon LTP induction in the dentate gyrus. Knockdown of miR-153 in the dentate gyrus results in more robust fear memory, suggesting that it plays a negative role in the regulation of synaptic strength. Consistent with this observation, overexpression of miR-153 in cultured hippocampal neurons reduces spine volume. Finally, consistent with the ability of miR-153 to suppress the expression of components of the SNARE-mediated vesicle exocytosis pathway, such as VAMP-2, and in support of a role for miR-153 as a negative regulator of synaptic plasticity, we discovered that overexpression of miR-153 suppresses the delivery of the AMPA receptors to the synapse in cultured neurons. Our findings suggest that miR-153 is a negative feedback regulator that is transcriptionally induced after contextual fear conditioning to downregulate changes that lead to increased synaptic strength. Furthermore, our bioinformatics analysis of the targets of the 21 fear-induced miRNAs, together with the validation of these targets for one member of the group, suggests that down regulation of the vesicular transport pathway, which has previously been shown to be critical for synaptic remodeling, is a major component of the network of activity-induced changes in neurons."

Adult female rats were trained with three foot shocks in a training chamber. We reasoned that miRNAs that are important for long-term memory may exhibit increased expression 24 hr after behavioral training had ceased. Although the distinct temporal phases or processes that take place during memory formation continue for several days, the transcription-dependent phase is relatively brief and is completed within 48 hr after training (<a href=\"#bib5\">Alberini, 2011</a>). Animals were therefore sacrificed 24 hr after training and the hippocampus was dissected (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We isolated RNA from 18 hippocampi, prepared independent samples with pools of RNA from three trained or na\u00efve animals, and using a miRNA microarray, identified 21 miRNAs that displayed at least 1.5-fold up-regulation in the hippocampus from trained rats compared to na\u00efve rats in three biological replicates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

                                "text": "To gain insight into the mechanisms by which this group of 21 miRNAs may regulate neuronal phenotype and synaptic transmission, we sought to identify their target mRNAs. Using a combination of the TargetScan, miRBase and microrna target prediction algorithms we identified over 3000 candidate genes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Betel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Griffiths-Jones et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>). We further reduced the number of candidates by requiring that the genes be expressed in the brain and possess binding sites for three or more of the 21 miRNAs. This strategy resulted in a list of 353 predicted targets (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Network analysis conducted with these genes identified pathways essential to neuronal development, vesicle transport, long-term potentiation and synaptic contact (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)\u00a0(See Experimental Procedures). The vesicle exocytosis pathway emerged as one of the top three enriched networks, with 15 genes out of the 40 known components of the pathway identified as predicted targets that could be co-regulated by the 21 miRNAs. Further analysis of the 15 genes identified in this pathway revealed binding sites for 12 of the 21 miRNAs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). These findings suggest that this group of miRNAs may be part of a regulatory network involved in suppressing vesicle exocytosis, a process that is required for neurotransmitter release, insertion of receptors at the synapse, and memory formation. MiR-153 emerged at the top of the list of 12 miRNAs responsible for regulating this group of genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>), with 12 potential targets in the vesicle exocytosis pathway. Interestingly 8 of these targets contained binding sites for three or more of the 21 fear-induced miRNAs based on our previous analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). The remaining 4 components of the vesicle exocytosis pathway had potential binding sites for either miR-153 alone, or together with one additional fear-induced miRNA (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We therefore chose to investigate the possible role of miR-153 in memory formation and regulation of vesicle exocytosis in neurons."

                                "text": "In order to form a long-term memory after contextual fear conditioning training, an animal must learn to associate a specific location (context) with a negative experience (foot shock). Several studies have indicated that contextual fear memory results from learning the context and shock alone, as well as the paired association (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fanselow, 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Frankland et al., 2004</a>). Therefore, distinct components of the animal\u2019s experience during contextual fear conditioning could differentially contribute to activation of the 21 fear-induced miRNAs. To determine the effect of the foot shock on miRNA expression, we analyze the expression of the fear-induced miRNAs in the hippocampus of adult rats that were trained with either an immediate shock test or the contextual fear conditioning paradigm (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fanselow, 1980</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Adult female rats trained with the contextual fear conditioning paradigm were trained with three delayed foot shocks as described above. Rats in the immediate shock group were taken from their home cage, placed into the conditioning chamber, and immediately shocked with three foot shocks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This behavioral paradigm does not allow the animal to form an associative memory between the context and the foot shock, as indicated by the absence of a freezing response in the immediate shock test group 24 hr after training (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Fanselow, 1986</a>). Animals were sacrificed 24 hr after training and the hippocampus was dissected. We isolated RNA from nine hippocampi for each na\u00efve, immediate shock (\u2018experience\u2019), and delayed shock (\u2018learning\u2019) groups, prepared independent samples with pools of RNA from three animals in each group (three biological replicates each containing three animals), and using RT-qPCR, analyzed hippocampal miRNA expression levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). This analysis revealed three distinct classes of fear-induced miRNAs. Class I miRNAs (miR-153, miR-181a, miR-204, miR-218) were induced only in the delayed shock group, indicating that their increased expression required associated learning (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Class II miRNAs (miR-27b, miR-219, miR-347) were induced in both the immediate and delayed shock groups, but displayed statistically significant higher expression levels in the delayed relative to the immediate shock group, suggesting that they were experience- and learning-induced (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Class III miRNAs (miR-9, miR-9*, miR-29b, and others) displayed increased expression in both the immediate and delayed shock groups, suggesting that they were experience-induced (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The majority of the fear-induced miRNAs belong to class III miRNAs, which are likely induced after exposing rats to a novel context and the application of either immediate or delayed shock. Overall these findings reveal distinct classes of fear-induced hippocampal miRNAs, a subset of which is only induced as a result of associative learning and includes miR-153."

LTP in the hippocampus is a lasting form of synaptic plasticity that has been implicated in mammalian learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bliss and Collingridge, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Martin et al., 2000</a>). One of the strongest correlations between the properties of behavioral memory formation and LTP is the evidence that each exhibits at least two mechanistically distinct phases of maintenance: an \u2018early\u2019 protein synthesis-independent phase that initiates synaptic changes and a transcription and protein synthesis dependent \u2018late\u2019 phase that contributes to activity-dependent structural changes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham and Otani, 1991</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">Abraham and Williams, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Matthies et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ostroff et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Raymond et al., 2000</a>). To assess whether the expression of miR-153 is induced during the maintenance of LTP, we examined perforant path-dentate gyrus LTP (PP-DG LTP) in acute hippocampal slices prepared from adult mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To facilitate further in vitro and genetic analysis of miR-153, we used mice as an experimental system for these and subsequent experiments. We note that miR-153 is highly conserved in vertebrates, displaying 100% sequence identity between rat, mouse, frog, and human (<a href=\"#bib61\">Mandemakers et al., 2013</a>). Extracellular field potentials evoked by perforant path stimulation were recorded in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus before and after high-frequency stimulation (HFS). LTP was quantified by examining HFS-induced changes in the slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Three hours after LTP induction, which is around the beginning of the late phase LTP, the dentate gyrus, and CA1-CA3 regions were isolated and expression of miR-153 was quantified by RT-qPCR. Control regions were isolated from the remaining acute hippocampal slices following 3 hr of incubation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of HFS, and expression of miR-153 was quantified by RT-qPCR. Consistent with the fear conditioning results, we observed elevated levels of miR-153 in the dentate gyrus, but not in the CA1-CA3 regions, after 3 hr of PP-DG LTP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), indicating that miR-153 expression is specifically induced in the dentate gyrus region during the late phase of LTP."

Histone H3 lysine 36 tri-methylation (H3K36me3) is associated with gene bodies of actively transcribed genes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Li et al., 2007</a>). Of the miRNAs identified in the microarray panel, miR-153 was the only miRNA that showed increased enrichment of H3K36me3 across the coding sequence in trained compared to na\u00efve rats (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). In mammals, miR-153 is located within the 19th intron of Ptprn2, a host gene that is conserved among a wide range of phylogenetic taxa (<a href=\"#bib104\">Xu et al., 2010</a>). Analysis of ENCODE H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data revealed two sites of enrichment within Ptprn2 (<a href=\"#bib18\">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</a>). The first site of enrichment is located at the promoter of Ptprn2; the second site of enrichment is located within the gene body, 100 kilobases upstream of the miR-153 coding sequence. Since H3K4me3 is generally associated with promoter regions, the second site of enrichment for H3K4me3 within the Ptprn2 gene body may represent an alternative transcription start site that could independently drive the expression of a miR-153 precursor transcript. To test this hypothesis, we measured RNA expression changes at the Ptprn2 locus close to its canonical promoter and downstream of the second H3K4me3 peak in trained and na\u00efve animals. We observed low levels of expression close to the Ptprn2 promoter, which were similar in trained and na\u00efve animals (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In contrast, the expression of the transcript downstream of the internal H3K4me3 peak, as assayed for the exon closest to the miR-153 coding sequence, increased 1.4-fold in trained animals (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), suggesting that miR-153 was probably generated by a separate transcriptional unit at the promoter found around the internal H3K4me3 region."

On the other hand, an increase in the expression of the precursor form of miR-153 was observed 1 hr after membrane polarization, but was reduced to baseline expression levels 2\u20133 hr after KCl treatment, suggesting that a precursor RNA may be induced rapidly and then processed into mature miR-153 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>)."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, the levels of miR-153 in GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons containing miRZip-153 were dramatically reduced compared to GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons containing the scrambled control miRZip. Inhibition of miR-153 function in the dentate gyrus resulted in a significant enhancement of long-term memory in the contextual fear-conditioning paradigm, whereas lentiviral-mediated delivery of a scrambled sequence did not affect fear memory (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In contrast, long-term memory in the cued fear-conditioning paradigm, which is predominantly amygdala-dependent (<a href=\"#bib79\">Phillips and LeDoux, 1992</a>), was not affected by knockdown of miR-153 in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Locomotion, anxiety-related and nociception behaviors were normal in miR-153 knockdown animals (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013M</a>) suggesting that the effect of miR-153 inhibition is hippocampal specific and is not due to differential pain sensitivity, motor coordination or anxiety levels in the injected groups of mice. These results demonstrate that miR-153 expression plays a specific role in attenuating contextual fear memory."

                                "text": "Several studies have suggested that changes in synaptic strength during memory formation and LTP induction correlate with corresponding changes in dendritic spine morphology. Dendritic spines are specialized actin-rich protrusions of the dendritic shaft. They are the major sites of excitatory synaptic connections and undergo morphological changes during development and in response to environmental stimuli (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bourne and Harris, 2008</a>). MiR-153 overexpression after fear conditioning and LTP induction, as well as the more robust fear response of mice after the inhibition of its activity, prompted us to explore a possible role for miR-153 in the\u00a0regulation of dendritic spine morphology. We performed time course RT-qPCR assays to detect the levels of miR-153 using primary hippocampal neurons at different days in vitro. We observed that miR-153 levels progressively increased and reached maximum levels after 10 days in vitro, when hippocampal neurons are differentiated and have made many synaptic connections, thus being more active (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Therefore, to test the effects of modulating miR-153 expression on dendritic spine geometry, we suppressed or enhanced miR-153 function in cultured mature hippocampal neurons by introducing either a miRZip-153 inhibiting vector to block the endogenous miR-153 activity or a miR-153 overexpressing vector to increase its levels (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lov\u00e9n et al., 2010</a>). The efficacy of these approaches was assessed using RT-qPCR to quantify miR-153 expression in neurons in which miR-153 was inhibited or overexpressed (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>). Analysis of the spine size in mature hippocampal neurons in which miR-153 was inhibited showed no significant change of the spine volume (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B,E,F</a>, and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Although, we did not observe a change in average spine head width in miR-153 knockdown compared to control neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>), analysis of the data as cumulative plots showed a significant increase in spine head width, most likely attributed to a group of spines of a particular size (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In contrast, miR-153 overexpression resulted in a significant decrease of the average spine volume, which was reduced to about 50% of the size of spines in the control scramble overexpressing hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013F</a>). Spine shrinkage in miR-153 overexpressing neurons was due to decreased spine head and neck widths (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013H</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013F</a>). Neither overexpression of miR-153, nor its inhibition had any measurable or significant effect on the average spine density or length (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013H</a>). The smaller effects observed in neurons where miR-153 is inhibited is likely due to the lower levels of miR-153 in un-stimulated neurons used in these experiments. Overall, these findings demonstrate that miR-153 activity modulates structural features of the synapse known to be associated with changes in plasticity."

The SNARE complex is essential for vesicle exocytosis of several \u2018cargo\u2019 proteins that critically mediate spine growth during synaptic potentiation, AMPA receptor trafficking in the postsynaptic neuron, and neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron during synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib96\">S\u00fcdhof, 2013</a>). Analysis of the full list of targets from the vesicle exocytosis pathway revealed a total of 12 predicted miR-153 targets (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Six predicted targets of miR-153 were selected from the vesicle exocytosis pathway for further analysis: <i>Snap25</i> and <i>Vamp2,</i> components of the SNARE complex, <i>Snca</i> and <i>Trak2</i> genes, which are important for vesicle trafficking, and <i>Bsn</i> and <i>Pclo</i> cytoskeletal associated proteins in the presynaptic area that are important for vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. Co-transfection of miR-153 into HEK-293T cells, a human cell line with undetectable levels of endogenous miR-153 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doxakis, 2010</a>), with the <i>Renilla</i> luciferase reporter fused to the 3\u2019UTR of <i>Snap25, Vamp2, Snca, Trak2, Bsn and Pclo</i> conferred\u00a0&gt;40% decrease in luciferase activity, indicating that each was a direct target of miR-153 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, purple bars). Mutation of the miR-153 seed region in the 3\u2019-UTR region of the above genes abrogated its inhibition by miR-153 expression, indicating that miR-153 directly targets each mRNA for silencing (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, white bars). Next, we overexpressed exogenous miR-153 using lentiviral-mediated delivery in cultured mature hippocampal neurons to determine how miR-153 levels affect the expression of the above target genes. As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, miR-153 overexpression resulted in a significant decrease in mRNA levels for each of the above targets except <i>Trak2</i>. MiR-153 therefore downregulates components of the vesicle transport pathway in both HEK293 and cultured mature hippocampal neurons."

These immediate early genes are considered critical regulators of a gene expression program that is induced to promote strengthening of synaptic connections. Analysis of the list of predicted targets for miR-153 revealed CBP/p300 as a candidate mRNA (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To test whether CBP/p300 was a direct target of miR-153, we cloned its 3\u02b9-UTRs downstream of the <i>Renilla</i> luciferase coding sequence and transfected each plasmid together with a vector overexpressing pri-miR-153 into HEK293T cells, as described above for vesicle exocytosis targets. Co-transfection of miR-153 with the <i>Renilla</i> luciferase reporter fused to the 3\u2019UTR of <i>CBP/p300</i> conferred a\u00a0&gt;70% decrease in luciferase activity (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

In order to assess whether miR-153 has a role in regulating AMPA receptor exocytosis, we monitored the exocytosis of GluA1 subunit using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We used differentiated neuroblastoma cells (N2A) that do not express miR-153 in order to examine the effect of ectopic miR-153 expression on AMPA receptor exocytosis. Differentiated N2A cells were transfected with a miR-153 expression vector or a scramble expression vector carrying an mCherry cassette to visualize cells expressing miR-153 along with a construct expressing the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptor tagged with a pH-sensitive form of EGFP (Super Ecliptic pHluorin, SEP) that displays fluorescence when it is present mainly on the cell surface (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). This strategy provides the opportunity to capture exocytosis of GluA1 receptor when it moves to the cell membrane from intracellular compartments. Three days after transfection, differentiated N2A cells were photobleached to eliminate SEP fluorescence and images were acquired every 10 min for 150 min (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). After photobleaching, SEP fluorescence in control cells gradually recovered by the end of the time course (<a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3A,C</a>).

Our analysis of their predicted targets suggests that components of the vesicular transport and synaptogenesis pathways are major substrates for regulation by these miRNAs. Further analysis of, miR-153, which is specifically induced as a result of associative learning, revealed that it inhibits the expression of several components of the vesicular transport machinery, regulates neuronal features, such as spine morphology, which correlate with LTP induction and learning, inhibits the transport of GluA1 AMPA receptors to the surface of neurons, and inhibits glutamate release/uptake. As would be expected from a functionally important learning-associated factor, miR-153 expression is specifically induced in dentate gyrus granule cells during LTP in hippocampal slices, and its knockdown in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus in adult mice results in enhanced fear memory. Together, our results suggest that microRNAs, such as miR-153, are experience- or learning-induced to act as negative feedback regulators of pathways associated with synaptic plasticity, such as the vesicle transport pathway, and may serve to attenuate changes associated with increased synaptic strength, such as the delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapse and neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic area (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>)."

In the mammalian brain, synaptic plasticity requires regulated trafficking of AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses, which mediates learning-induced changes in the number and stoichiometry of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors (<a href=\"#bib64\">Matsuo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Whitlock et al., 2006</a>). More specifically, NMDA receptor-triggered LTP involves exocytosis of GluA1 AMPA receptor subunits and an increase in their density at the postsynaptic membrane (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hayashi and Huganir, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Lu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Park et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Passafaro et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Pickard et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Shi et al., 1999</a>). Receptor exocytosis is mediated by the soluble NSF-attachment protein receptor (SNARE) pathway, which attaches intracellular vesicles to their target membranes and drives membrane fusion. In this study, we show that VAMP2 and SNAP25 SNAREs are post-transcriptionally regulated by somatodendritically localized miR-153. The negative effect of miR-153 on VAMP2 and SNAP25 expression as well as on the delivery of the GluA1 receptors to the cell surface, together with the well-established role of GluA1 receptor transport in LTP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I,J</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Shepherd and Huganir, 2007</a>), provides an explanation for enhancement of fear memory following the knockdown of miR-153 in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Furthermore, miR-153 expression is induced in the dentate gyrus during LTP in acute hippocampal slices via stimulation of the perforant path-dentate granule cell neuronal pathway (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>). This is the physiological pathway for input of fear-associated sensory information into the dentate gyrus. Together the results support the idea that activation of a learning-associated neuronal pathway induces miR-153 expression in the brain to modulate memory formation. Finally, our in silico analysis revealed an additional 11 fear-induced miRNAs that may potentially target vesicle exocytosis and participate in AMPA receptor trafficking at the postsynaptic area. Therefore, AMPA receptor trafficking is likely to be regulated by the coordinated action of a large number of fear-induced miRNAs."

ShRNA-mediated knock-down of several SNARE proteins in combination with high-resolution live cell imaging has demonstrated a role for a unique SNARE-dependent fusion machinery in exocytosis of AMPA and NMDA receptors at the postsynaptic area (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jurado et al., 2013</a>). The R-SNARE protein VAMP2 and Q-SNARE protein SNAP25 are essential components of the postsynaptic vesicle fusion machinery that is required for neurotransmitter receptor trafficking during basal- and LTP-induced neuronal activity, suggesting that these SNAREs are important for both constitutive and regulated exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jurado et al., 2013</a>). VAMP2 contributes to constitutive and regulated postsynaptic AMPA receptor trafficking, while SNAP25 plays a role in the constitutive postsynaptic trafficking of NMDA receptors (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jurado et al., 2013</a>). In our studies, miR-153 overexpression in cultured hippocampal neurons resulted in decreased expression of both VAMP2 and SNAP25, indicating that both SNAREs could be regulated by miR-153. However, in vivo knock down of miR-153 in the dentate gyrus resulted in an increase in the expression of VAMP2 but not SNAP25 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,F</a>). The VAMP2 component of the SNARE pathway may therefore be the major in vivo target for miR-153-mediated regulation of AMPA receptor exocytosis."

Vamp2 and Snap25 were initially characterized as components of SNARE complexes that mediate vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic area (<a href=\"#bib93\">S\u00f6llner et al., 1993a</a>, <a href=\"#bib94\">1993b</a>). In addition, cytoskeleton associated proteins such as Bsn and Pclo (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fenster et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">tom Dieck et al., 1998</a>), both of which are also miR-153 targets (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>), participate in vesicle transport at the presynaptic area. Our demonstration that miR-153 knock-down increases activity-dependent glutamate release is consistent with a general role for miR-153 in down-regulation of vesicle transport and fusion at both the pre- and post-synaptic areas. In agreement with a role for miR-153 in neurotransmitter release (this study), studies in zebrafish have shown that loss of miR-153 results in increased Snap25 expression and consequently motor neuron defects and hyperactive movement of early zebrafish embryos (<a href=\"#bib101\">Wei et al., 2013</a>). At least one other miRNA, miR-137, has been implicated in presynaptic vesicle transport (<a href=\"#bib89\">Siegert et al., 2015</a>). MiR-137 overexpression results in the downregulation of presynaptic components of the SNARE complexes, such as Complexin-1 (Cplx1), Nsf, and Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), leading to impaired vesicle release. In vivo, overexpression of miR-137 in the dentate gyrus results in changes in synaptic vesicle pool distribution, impaired mossy fiber-LTP induction and deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib89\">Siegert et al., 2015</a>). In contrast to miR-153, miR-137 expression was not induced in our studies. MiR-137 may therefore play an important role in the\u00a0constitutive regulation of basal SNARE protein levels that impact presynaptic neurotransmitter release."

We note that, in addition to the brain, both miR-153 and its host gene, Ptprn2, are expressed in the pancreas and affect insulin secretion following glucose stimulation in pancreatic cell lines (<a href=\"#bib61\">Mandemakers et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Xu et al., 2015</a>). Pancreatic beta cells express many of the components that are required for regulated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in neurons (<a href=\"#bib36\">Jacobsson et al., 1994</a>). In fact, four of the predicted targets from the vesicle exocytosis pathway (<i>Pclo</i>, <i>Snap25</i>, <i>Snca</i> and <i>Vamp2</i>) are also regulated by miR-153 in pancreatic cell lines (<a href=\"#bib61\">Mandemakers et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, miR-153 downregulates vesicle transport and fusion to suppress neurotransmitter release in neurons and may function in a similar manner to suppress insulin secretion in the pancreas following stimulation with glucose. Moreover, Ptprn2 localizes to synaptic vesicles and facilitates the secretion of neurotransmitters in the brain and insulin in the pancreas through an unknown mechanism (<a href=\"#bib71\">Nishimura et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">2009</a>). MiR-153 and its host gene may therefore have the capacity to negatively and positively regulate downstream targets, respectively. However, while in the pancreas miR-153 expression appears to be under the control of the <i>Ptprn2</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib61\">Mandemakers et al., 2013</a>), activity-dependent expression of miR-153 in the hippocampus is driven by an alternative promoter (this study), allowing it to act independently of its host gene. Further studies are required to determine the intriguing relationship between the activities of miR-153 and its host gene in neuronal and pancreatic cells."

In this regard, neuronal activity promotes the association of several immediate early transcription factors with the miR-153 promoter, suggesting that miR-153 is likely to be transcriptionally induced by the immediate early gene program in an activity-dependent manner. Similarly to the regulation of vesicle exocytosis pathway, activity-induced miRNAs may function as negative feedback regulators to suppress the expression programs that are required for the initial structural and functional changes at the synapse. MiR-153 and the immediate early gene, CBP/p300, are one example of this type of feedback regulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Our findings suggest that miR-153 may negatively regulate the expression of CBP/p300 as a means of controlling CBP/p300 function and may help to prevent excessive CBP/p300-mediated activation of downstream targets. MiR-153 may act together with other fear-induced miRNAs to provide feedback control to return the immediate early gene program to basal levels of expression."

                                "text": "Experience-dependent rewiring of neural circuits is triggered by changes in activity patterns that initiate and ultimately produce long-term modifications of synapses. We speculate that miR-153, together with other fear-induced miRNAs presented in this study, are induced in response to neuronal activity and may perform at least two functions, which are not mutually exclusive. First, by suppressing many plasticity genes that are induced in activated neurons, late acting miRNAs, such as miR-153, may help stabilize firing rates and restore baseline function, thus enabling the circuit to process new information. Second, miR-153 class of miRNAs may set a threshold for linking the strength of excitatory signals to long-term changes in synaptic strength. For example, ready induction of miR-153 may dampen weak signals but allow changes in synaptic strength as a result of stronger signals. Consistent with the results presented here, other studies have shown that the expression of several mammalian miRNAs is rapidly induced after enhanced neuronal activity coupled to learning in various paradigms, such as contextual fear conditioning or olfaction discrimination (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Smalheiser et al., 2010</a>). In addition to the dentate gyrus (this study), distinct populations of miRNAs are upregulated in the CA1 region of the hippocampus at early (1\u20133 hr) and late (24 hr) stages of learning and have been proposed to regulate memory formation by increasing protein synthesis through de-repression of mTOR activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kye et al., 2011</a>). Thus activity-induced miRNAs are likely to exert both positive and negative effects on memory formation. However, the vast majority of the miRNAs we detected have not been implicated in memory formation and with the exception of miR-9, miR-219 and miR-125a, their role in synaptic plasticity is unknown (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ifrim et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kocerha et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Malmevik et al., 2016</a>). Thus, this set of miRNAs is a valuable resource for future studies. Comprehensive functional characterization of miR-153 demonstrated its role as a negative feedback regulator of synaptic strength that is fear- and LTP- induced, primarily in dentate gyrus granule cells. Further studies of fear-induced miRNAs are therefore likely to provide insight into how different regions of the hippocampus respond to learning-induced inputs. Future studies on the molecular function of the fear-induced miRNAs will also shed light on the pathways they target, individually or combinatorially, during memory formation."

In this regard, miR-153 targets the amyloid precursor protein (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doxakis, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Liang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Long et al., 2012</a>) and alpha synuclein (<a href=\"#bib90\">Singleton et al., 2003</a>), which has been proposed to interact with the SNARE machinery and participate in vesicle clustering at the presynaptic area (<a href=\"#bib13\">Burr\u00e9 et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gureviciene et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, miR-9 dysregulation is frequently associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Huntington\u2019s disease, miR-338\u20133p is upregulated in the frontal cortex of human ALS patients (<a href=\"#bib16\">De Felice et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Packer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Shioya et al., 2010</a>) and miR29b is downregulated in sporadic cases of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and its expression levels are reduced in a murine model of Huntington\u2019s disease and human cortex samples from patients with Huntington\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib34\">H\u00e9bert et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Johnson et al., 2008</a>). Altered expression of miR-29b and miR-181b was also found in the postmortem brain of patients with schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib10\">Beveridge et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Perkins et al., 2007</a>). Activity-dependent induction of these miRNAs may therefore aid in preventing neuronal toxicity by downregulating these and other proteins during neuronal stimulation. In addition to providing mechanistic insight into how fear based memory is encoded and stored in the hippocampus, future functional analysis of the miRNAs presented in this study may prove useful in the development of strategies to treat neurodegenerative diseases."

Sex differences in laboratory rodent species have been reported during acquisition, retention and extinction in classical and operant conditioning paradigms (<a href=\"#bib62\">Maren et al., 1994</a>). In the classical fear-conditioning paradigm males outperform females, or are more resistant to extinction (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dalla et al., 2009</a>). Typically behavioral training does not include cohorts of female rodents because it is assumed that their behaviors are similar, but more variable, relative to males (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dalla et al., 2009</a>). However, we confirmed that overexpression of miR-153 after fear conditioning is not a sex-specific response by performing behavioral training with adult male wild-type mice. We observed an increase in hippocampal levels of miR-153 following training (data not shown). Rats were approximately 90 days old at the start of the experiment and were individually housed with ad lib food and water throughout the experiment. Two sets of four operant chambers (Med-Associates, St. Albans, VT) located in separate rooms were used (counterbalanced).

Small RNA from the nine animals was pooled together into three groups to generate three biological replicates for each condition (immediate shock, delayed shock, and na\u00efve). Three 500 ng pools of small RNA per condition were used for RT-qPCR analysis with the TaqMan small RNA assay (Applied Biosystems) with TaqMan RT and PCR primers designed specifically for each miRNA as well as the control (RNU58). Each of the three pools of small RNA from nine different trained, immediate shock or na\u00efve rats were analyzed in triplicate. Expression values were first normalized to the control (RNU58) then divided by na\u00efve values to determine fold-change relative to the na\u00efve condition. Data are presented as fold-change relative to na\u00efve rats from the three pools measured in triplicate (mean \u00b1\u00a0SEM)."

Then, slices were transferred to a recording chamber, maintained at 32\u00b0C and continuously perfused at 1\u20132 ml/min with oxygenated aCSF. Recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass and filled with 3\u00a0M NaCl (1.5 mm o.d.; Sutter Instruments). The recording pipette was placed in the medial molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Recordings were made with a MultiClamp 700\u00a0B amplifier, collected using Clampex 10.3, and analyzed using Clampfit 10.3 (Molecular Devices).

For experiments, current was set at a level to elicit 30% of the maximum response. After 20 min of stable baseline, LTP was induces by delivering 100 pulses at 50 Hz (four times separated by 15 s). 3 hr after LTP induction slices were harvested for further analysis.

Lifeact-Ruby neurons were identified by anti-RFP primary antibody and then a secondary Alexa-555. This procedure was similar to that used for dendritic spine geometry analysis. Neurons for the phenotypic analyses were imaged using either widefield or spinning disk confocal microscopy. Widefield images used for the phenotypic analyses were collected using a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA R2 cooled CCD camera controlled with MetaMorph 7 software (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002368\">SCR_002368</a>).

Spinning disk confocal images used for figures were collected using a Yokogawa CSU-X1 mounted on a Nikon Ti-E, a Spectral Applied Research LMM-7 laser launch with AOTF control of intensity and wavelength, and a Hamamatsu ORCA-AG cooled CCD camera controlled with MetaMorph 7 software. GFP was imaged with a 491 nm solid state laser and a 535/50 emission filter, and Lifeact-Ruby neurons were imaged with a 561 nm solid state laser and 620/60 emission filter, both using a QUAD 405/491/561/642 dichroic.

Neurons were selected based on the eGFP staining. For this analysis, we obtained images from two independent experiments per condition and three coverslips for each experiment. Filament tracer plugin of Imaris software (version 7.6.5, Bitplane Inc.; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007370\">SCR_007370</a>) used for this analysis. Similar to the dendritic analysis, in the Imaris Surpass mode, a new 3D filament was created using the Autopath mode and a region of interest (ROI) was selected. We restricted the spine analysis in secondary or tertiary dendrites to reduce variability and we analyzed about 100 \u00b5m\u2013150\u00a0\u00b5m of dendritic segments from at least two dendrites per neuron. The dendrite reconstruction was created based on the eGFP signal and dendritic spines were reconstructed based on the Lifeact-ruby signal. After the completion of the analysis for each neuron we extracted the data for the spine volume, spine length, spine terminal diameter (head width), spine mean neck width. Spine density was calculated per neuron by dividing the total number of spines by the total length of dendrites measured in each cell. The means for these parameters were calculated for each neuron separately and then the averages from all neurons together were plotted as average numbers for each condition. Alternatively, all the individual values were used to generate cumulative plots. In addition to the unpaired t-tests, we performed multiple pairwise comparisons using one-way ANOVA: [spine volume: (p\u00a0value\u00a0=\u00a00.04, F\u00a0=\u00a02925), spine width: (p\u00a0value\u00a0=\u00a00.0124, F\u00a0=\u00a03904), spine length: (p\u00a0value\u00a0=\u00a00,4231, F\u00a0=\u00a00,9476), spine neck width: (p\u00a0value\u00a0=\u00a00,0046, F\u00a0=\u00a04741), spine density: (p\u00a0value\u00a0=\u00a00,0154, F\u00a0=\u00a03731)]."

They were co-transfected with the plasmid pCI-SEP-GluA1 to express the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors tagged with Super Ecliptic pHluorin (SEP), along with pCDH lentivectors (SBI) in which GFP was replaced by mCherry, to overexpress miR-153 or a scramble control that expresses the mCherry to visualize transfected cells. One day before imaging they were differentiated with serum deprivation. Wide field images were acquired using a Nikon Ti-E motorized inverted microscope equipped with Plan Apo 100x NA/1.49 objective lens and the Perfect Focus System for maintenance of focus over time. Images were collected with a Hamamatsu D2 cooled CCD camera controlled with MetaMorph 7 software. SEP-GluA1 was imaged with a 480/40 excitation filter and 535/50 emission filter, mCherry was imaged with a 545/30 excitation filter and a 620/60 emission filter. Photobleaching of cells was performed using the 488 laser TIRF illumination light path in epifluorescence mode with 100% laser intensity for 45 s followed by widefield imaging for the remainder of the experiment. The integrated SEP intensity of photobleached cells (N\u00a0=\u00a05\u20138 cells/condition) at each time point was measured using Fiji software, and normalized to that of un-bleached cells to correct for possible fluorescence decay due to repetitive image acquisition. The proportion of recovered SEP at each time point after bleaching (corrected fluorescence intensity/pre-bleaching fluorescence intensity) was calculated and expressed as fold change over the levels of SEP at the first time point after photobleaching. The image data were analyzed with a two-tailed Mann Whitney U test in order to calculate p-values."

Although the total number of cells is reduced relative to the quantity expected from the entire hippocampus, this value provides a minimum percentage of cells infected with the miR-153 or scramble control lentivirus. We have revised our Methods section to include the percentage of the cells infected with the miR-153 knockdown lentivirus in the DG. Long-term gene knockdown with the use of lentiviral vectors delivering shRNA has been successfully performed previously, for example, see Abbas- Terki et al., 2002; Chew et al., 2015; Seifert et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2010; Kanninen et al., 2009; Goshen et al., 2011. Our lentiviral- mediated delivery of shRNA against miR-153 into the mouse DG was intended to reduce miR-153 levels within DG granule cells. In our study, GFP<sup>+</sup> hippocampal cells showed a significant reduction in miR-153 expression relative to GFP<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from the scramble control (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Infection of 10% of the total cell population in the hippocampus was sufficient to elicit behavioral differences between both groups of animals. Our results suggest that increased neurotransmitter release and enhanced vesicle transport, upon knockdown of miR-153, are responsible for the behavioral adaptations observed. In future studies we will assess the impact of miR-153 expression on freezing time in the contextual fear conditioning paradigm but feel that these additional experiments are better suited for a separate manuscript."

To test the effects of miR-153 perturbation on dendritic spine morphology and density and present the data, we used two different methods that have been used in the literature before. We calculated the mean values of each feature of the spine for every individual neuron separately and then plotted the average of all neurons per condition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, we presented the data as cumulative plots including all the measurements of the individual spines, using similar numbers of spines per individual neuron for each condition (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Spine head width based on the calculation of the mean values had an increase of 0.04\u03bcm (stated in the main text), which was not significant compared to control cells. However, in the cumulative plots using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to calculate statistical significance, we observed increase in the spine head width in the miR-153KD neurons compared to the scramble KD, with a p value p&lt;0.001 and D=0.09, as we stated in the legend of <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>. Since spine head width has a range of different values, presenting the data in the form of cumulative plots allows for detection of moderate changes. For example, changes that occur in a group of spines of a particular size, which would be missed otherwise.
