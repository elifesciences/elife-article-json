However, exposing the bees to both the frontal airflow and front-to-back image motion as normally experienced during forward flight caused the bees to maintain their antennae in a fixed position.

For instance, purely optic flow-based measurements of self-motion can be misleading for insects which experience sideslip while flying in a crosswind. Moreover, reliance on optic flow may be problematic under dimly lit or overcast conditions, or when flying over lakes or deserts which present sparse visual feedback. In such situations, sampling from multiple sensory cues reduces the ambiguity arising from variability in feedback from single modalities (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wehner, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sherman and Dickinson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wasserman et al., 2015</a>).

Disruption of antennal positioning due to B\u00f6hm\u2019s bristle ablation or reduction of JO inputs severely impairs flight (<a href=\"#bib52\">Willis et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hinterwirth and Daniel, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sane et al., 2007</a>). The control of antennal position is thought to be essential for the unambiguous sensing of inputs by the JO (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hinterwirth et al., 2012</a>). However, the mechanisms underlying this behaviour are not well-understood. Here, we show that the airflow cues sensed by Johnston\u2019s organs and the optic\u00a0flow cues sensed by eyes combine to maintain and control antennal position during flight in the honeybee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>. Each input influences antennal position in an opposite manner; frontal airflow causes antennae to move actively forward against the aerodynamic drag, whereas front-to-back optic flow causes them to move backward. The antennal positioning response thus offers a critical readout for understanding how honeybees integrate information about their own motion from airflow and optic flow cues."

When the antennae move backwards, the IAA increases and when the antennae move forward, the IAA decreases. Of the three conventional variables used in such experiments (<a href=\"#bib10\">David, 1982</a>), we experimentally set the <i>windspeed</i> (<i>i.e.</i> velocity of ambient airflow relative to ground) in a calibrated, laminar wind tunnel, whereas the bees controlled their own <i>airspeed</i> (<i>i.e.</i> velocity of body relative to ambient air) and therefore also their <i>groundspeed</i> (<i>i.e.</i> velocity of the body relative to ground), which is the vector sum of <i>airspeed</i> and <i>windspeed</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). As tethered bees are stationary relative to the ground, their <i>airspeed</i> equals <i>windspeed</i>. However, when freely flying in air currents, <i>airspeed</i> and <i>windspeed</i> are independent of each other. Analogous to swimmers swimming within water currents, insects control their <i>airspeed</i> relative to the air pocket drifting at some <i>windspeed</i>."

JO spans the pedicel-flagellar joint in the antennae of all Neopteran insects, and tracks the motion of the flagella relative to pedicel. In most insects, the JO consists of several hundred scolopidial units that are range-fractionated. These enable both exquisite sensitivity and narrowly-tuned sensing over\u00a0a large range of stimulus frequencies (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yorozu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dieudonn\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>). Does JO also mediate the observed antennal response to changes in airspeed? To test this hypothesis, we attenuated JO feedback by gluing the pedicel-flagellar joint (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) in tethered honeybees, and measured their antennal responses to airflow. To control for the extraneous effects of glue on the antenna (e.g. due to added weight), we glued the second annulus of the flagella from the tip (<i>sham-treatment</i>) in a separate group of the bees. Application of glue at the JO does not affect the movement of the antennae because the pedicellar-flagellar joints have no muscles, and hence motion around these joints are passive. Unlike sham-treated bees which showed the typical sigmoid response to frontal airflow (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, non-normalized data in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement\u00a01H</a>, N=5), bees with restricted JO positioned their antennae at the onset of flight (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement\u00a01I</a>; also [<a href=\"#bib27\">Krishnan et al., 2012</a>]) but their mean IAA at each airflow was insensitive to changing airspeeds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, N=7; p&gt;0.1, Moore\u2019s paired test). These experiments established that JO input is required for antennal positioning during flight, but not at flight onset (<a href=\"#bib27\">Krishnan et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the antennal positioning at flight onset is a separate process from the inflight modulation of IAA."

(<b>B</b>) Sample IAA response to linearly increasing (red) or decreasing (green) optic flow stimulus. (Top panel) Stimulus comprises of a visual grating moving from front to back at temporal frequencies ranging between 0\u201325 cycles/s (cps), in steps of 1 cps. Each step lasts for 1 s (blue). The IAA response to optic flow saturates beyond the threshold of 10 cps (grey bar; also Materials and methods for threshold calculation). (<b>C\u2013E</b>) IAA Response to randomized optic flow values. The above honeybee (the individual shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013E</a>, bee #1), was presented with randomized optic flow stimulus (<b>C</b>). The precise temporal sequence of randomized stimulus varied between bees. Dotted line shows the 10 cps threshold. Each 1 cps step lasts for 1\u00a0s from 1\u201325 cps. IAA response is plotted in two ways: the IAA response to the randomized stimulus (<b>D</b>, olive green bars), and the response reshuffled in increasing order of temporal frequencies (E; blue bars). The peak at 20 cps is due to the sharp IAA readjustment at stimulus onset. Grey lines between <b>C</b> and <b>D</b> indicate step transitions in temporal frequency values. IAA is predicted to change when stimulus changes occur below or across threshold. Predicted changes in IAA are marked by black circle and no change by white circle. IAA is predicted to decrease (down arrowhead) when optic flow changes from high-to-low under or across threshold, and increase (up arrowhead) when values change from low-to-high under or across threshold. Changes in temporal frequency above threshold (horizontal line) yield no antennal response. In both tests, correct predictions are marked by green and wrong predictions by red circles, and fraction of correct predictions vs. total number indicated beside each test. In this instance, we correctly predicted when IAA would change with 83% accuracy\u00a0(19/23=0.83), and the direction of its change with 74% accuracy.

In all the cases, the total prediction score matched the actual observed score well above chance levels (*p&lt;0.001; Student\u2019s T test; see Materials and methods for details).

Hence, in the follow-up experiments, we focused on the lower range of stimuli from 0\u20131.8 cps (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013J</a>). Even in this narrow range, IAA responses tracked the magnitude and direction of grating patterns on the screen. For example, bee antennae robustly tracked simple sinusoidal stimuli that were both, cycled between front-to-back (0 to 1.8 cps), and back-to-front grating movement (0 to -1.8 to 0 cps) over the 10\u2009s duration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), thus verifying that the antennae move in both directions as a function of optic flow. To characterize their responses in this narrow range of temporal frequency (0\u20131.8\u00a0cps), the tethered bees initiated wing flapping in front of a blank screen, followed by a sequence of black-and-white gratings moving front-to-back from 1.8 to 0.3 cps. Each grating sequence lasted for 6 s, interspersed with a static screen (zero optic flow) for 3 s. Despite inter-animal variability in the set points for IAA at zero optic flow (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement\u00a02A</a>), all bees increased their IAA as a function of optic flow (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>), with each step change of 0.3 cps eliciting significant increase in mean IAA (*p&lt;0.0001; Moore\u2019s paired test, N=10) at that optic flow rate. The IAA response of tethered bees to optic flow remained intact (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement\u00a02B</a>) even when their JO were restricted by gluing the pedicel-flagellar joint, establishing that it is independent of the JO pathway.

This can be summarized in a general schematic of the multi-modal integration of antennal positioning behaviour in flying honeybees (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). For the sake of completeness, this model must also include the role of the mechanosensory hair plates (or B\u00f6hm\u2019s bristles) in reflexive antennal positioning, which appears conserved across insects according to our studies in moths (<a href=\"#bib27\">Krishnan et al., 2012</a>), bees and crickets (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sant and Sane, 2016</a>). To summarize these studies: antennal hair plates are stimulated when the antenna undergoes a substantial movement in the scape-head capsule or pedicel-scape joints. The mechanosensory neurons underlying these bristles directly project into the Antennal Motor and Mechanosensory Center (AMMC) where they arborize on the dendritic fields of antennal motor neurons and activate them. Any gross change in antennal position thus elicits a rapid reflexive correction of the antennal position with latencies under 10 ms in hawk moths (<a href=\"#bib27\">Krishnan et al., 2012</a>) and probably on the same order in honeybees and other insects. Based on these data, we proposed a model to describe the antennal positioning reflex loop mediated <i>via</i> antennal mechanosensors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Krishnan et al., 2012</a>). Although arrangement of the hair plates in different insects varies, the underlying neural circuitry and hair plate function is conserved in moths, bees, and most other insect orders\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib29\">Krishnan and Sane, 2015</a>). Previous studies in hawk moths have described only how the antenna, once positioned, reflexively maintains this position (<a href=\"#bib27\">Krishnan et al., 2012</a>), and also their response to visual cues (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krishnan and Sane, 2014</a>).

This study also shows that their action is <i>via</i> multi-modal pathways which combine in a mutually antagonistic fashion; whereas frontal airflow detected by JO reduces IAA, the front-to-back optic flow detected by compound eyes increases IAA. The combination of these inputs modifies IAA to a new set point, which is then maintained by the antennal hair plates <i>via</i> a negative feedback loop that ensures rapid maintenance and correction of the antennal position. The block diagram in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> thus provides a model for multimodal sensory control of antennal positioning response.

In particular, restriction of the JO feedback has no effect on the <i>antennal deployment behaviour</i>, whereas it completely disrupts <i>inflight antennal positioning.</i> It has been suggested that inflight modulation of IAA maintains the scolopidial units of the JO in their operating range (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hinterwirth et al., 2012</a>).

Visual feedback also induces directionally-sensitive antennal movements in other insects such as hawk moths\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Krishnan and Sane, 2014</a>), <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mamiya et al., 2011</a>), and many orthopteran insects (<a href=\"#bib24\">Honegger, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ye et al., 2003</a>). Unlike the hair plate reflexes which are strictly unilateral (<a href=\"#bib27\">Krishnan et al., 2012</a>), visual feedback drives the activity of both ipsi- and contralateral antennal motor neurons in moths (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krishnan and Sane, 2014</a>) and may therefore serve to coordinate the movements of both antennae. The mechanosensory pathways mediated by the hair plates then provide rapid reflexive, local correction of the intended position of each antenna."

In freely-flying moths, the stimulation of antennal muscles elicits abdominal flexion accompanied by a change in flight trajectory (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hinterwirth et al., 2012</a>).

In locusts, the tritocerebral commissure giant (TCG) interneurone integrates visual and airflow information (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bacon and Tyrer, 1978</a>), while other descending interneurons in crickets integrate antennal mechanosensory and visual inputs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gebhardt and Honegger, 2001</a>).

                                "text": "The data on antennal position are also relevant to studies on speedometry in honeybees. A key finding of this paper is that IAA responds to absolute airspeed values from 1.5 to 3\u2009m/s, which is narrow compared to the typical range of airspeeds (between 0 and 7\u2009m/s; <a href=\"#bib50\">[Wenner, 1963</a>])of honeybees in free flight. IAA is also calibrated against optic flow cues, but this feedback depends on the spatial structure of the environment. As shown in studies over the past two decades, the odometer in honeybees is quite clearly visual (<a href=\"#bib44\">Srinivasan, 2014</a>). The visual system can extract the overall image motion, which is perceived by and integrated over the motion detectors in the retina (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zanker et al., 1999</a>). Honeybees trained to find food at a specific distance in tunnels lined with visual stripes can correctly judge distances even when the spatial frequency of the stripes is altered (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baird et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Srinivasan et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">2014</a>). Moreover, they estimate distances correctly despite head or tailwinds, suggesting that parameters such as windspeed, flight duration and number of wing beats etc. play no role in the odometry. Indeed, image motion cues can also be used to estimate depth and distinguish between near and far objects independent of their size (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kirchner and Srinivasan, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Srinivasan et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zhang et al., 1992</a>). Thus, bees appear to be able to separately process size and velocity cues (<a href=\"#bib40\">Srinivasan et al., 1993</a>)."

                                "text": "Complement to the visual odometer, we show here that honeybees are also able to extract information about both airspeed and groundspeed. Importantly, the airspeed calibration mediated by JO is absolute, but works over a narrow speed range, whereas the groundspeed calibration mediated by optic flow can be tuned over a broader range. We propose the hypothesis that honeybees calibrate their optic flow speedometer using their JO-based system that measures absolute airspeeds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). At the onset of a regular flight bout, bees simultaneously sample the optic flow (red lines) and airspeed (blue line). The three red lines correspond to temporal frequency of optic flow that is slow (i.e. if objects are far away) to fast (i.e. if objects are close). Sampling the optic flow (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>; black segments on the red lines) corresponding to the dynamic range of the JO-based airspeed sensor (e.g. between ~1.5 to 3\u2009m/s) provides bees with the means to cross-calibrate average optic flow against absolute airspeeds. As the airspeed-based estimation only works in a narrow range from 1.5 to 3\u2009m/s, the optic flow-based speedometer requires extrapolation well beyond the range of the antennal system. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>, the presence of one cue linearly offsets the response curve for the other, analogous to using a standardized <i>albeit</i> narrow-ranging measure (e.g. airflow-based speedometer) to calibrate another arbitrarily scalable measure (e.g. the optic\u00a0flow based speedometer). A disadvantage of such a system is that it must be recalibrated at the beginning of each bout, or within bouts in case of sudden gusts of wind which may confound the calibration. Under such circumstances, we predict that honeybees would have to slow down to recalibrate their optic\u00a0flow based speedometer against the airspeed-based speedometer, before resuming flight."

In their study on visual regulation of groundspeeds in honeybees, Barron and Srinivasan (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barron and Srinivasan, 2006</a>) observed that honeybees freely flying within a tunnel lined with checkerboard patterns flew at speeds of approximately 0.4\u2009m/s. However, when the checkerboard pattern was replaced by an axial-stripe pattern which offered sparse optic flow cues, its groundspeed was maintained with low variance at a value of 1.4\u2009m/s. Maintenance of ground speeds (which equals airspeed in still air) requires that bees be able to \u2018sense\u2019 their speed even when optic flow cues are sparse. How is this possible if speed is maintained only <i>via</i> optic flow? To explain this result, we propose that, in absence of optic flow, the bees rely on their JO-based airflow sensors to both set <i>and maintain</i> groundspeed. It is worth noting that the value of 1.4\u2009m/s lies at the cusp of the airflow response curve (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), and is maintained as the new reference at different wind speeds in sparse optic flow (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> in <a href=\"#bib6\">Barron and Srinivasan [2006]</a>)."

It is not presently clear if the visual odometer would need such information as the current model for visual odometry is able to quite robustly explain most observations. One would expect such a speedometer system to accumulate errors as the range increases, as has also been observed with the honeybee odometer, which follows the Weber\u2019s law (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cheng et al., 1999</a>). Future studies will be required to determine if the several predictions that emerge from this model about honeybee speed control hold true. The antennal positioning responses thus provide unique insights into how honeybees and perhaps other insects sense and combine information from multiple modalities to help reduce ambiguities arising from drift in any one modality."

The feeder was moved in a series of discrete steps from the insectary to the laboratory. The protocol typically took 7 days at the end of which the bees were trained to enter the wind tunnel and fly upwind to the feeder placed within the wind tunnel. To enable identification of individual bees, we marked them at the feeder with colored acrylic paint on the thorax and abdomen. A marked bee entering the wind tunnel experienced frontal external air flow at speeds ranging between 0\u2009m/s and 3.5\u2009m/s (step size of 0.5\u2009m/s). We filmed the marked bees with two synchronized high speed cameras at 500 fps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, top). We obtained a 1 s video of flight in a straight trajectory for each bee at each wind speed value. The marked bee was filmed at a new randomly chosen airflow speed each time it entered the wind tunnel until the dataset for each bee was complete."

The spatial frequency of the grating was 0.44 cm<sup>-1</sup>. In the first set of experiments, the bees were provided with a linear change of temporal frequency from 0 to 25 cps in both ascending and descending manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). We also provided the bees with this range of optic flow (between 1\u201325 cps) but in a randomized manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement\u00a01B\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement\u00a01F\u2013H</a>).

In the second set of experiments when the optic flow changed between 0 and 1.8 cps, we displayed each grating speed for 6 s, followed by a static screen which was displayed for 3 s before the next grating speed value was displayed.

The combination of cues was chosen from three regimes as described in the main text. The highest optic flow value was paired with the highest airflow value (Regime C), the mid-range optic flow value with the mid-range airflow value (Regime B) and the lowest optic flow with the lowest airflow (Regime A). We first filmed the antennae of bees flying at cues from Regime B and then either increased the speeds of airflow and optic flow to Regime C, or decreased the speeds to Regime A respectively.

We then binned the IAA values for each temporal frequency together to calculate a mean and standard deviation of the IAA response at each temporal frequency rate. We then compared these mean IAA to every other IAA value in the dataset for the bee using the paired non-parametric Moore\u2019s circular test in Oriana 4 (Kovach Computing Services, Anglesey, UK). The temporal frequency rate after which the mean IAA values are not significantly different from the rest of the IAA values is considered the threshold for that bee. The threshold for the bee shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> is 10 cps, for the bee in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement\u00a01A</a> is 14 cps and for the bee shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement\u00a01E</a> is 14 cps. The response to the first temporal frequency value is always distinguishable from the rest of the responses as the animal positions its antennae to changing optic flow (from zero to the first value). From the second optic flow onwards, the IAA changes as a response to the change in optic flow (from high to low or low to high) and not with the absolute value of the optic flow. Now that we know the threshold of the antennal response to optic flow, we can predict if for every change in temporal frequency value from one value to a randomly chosen value and so forth, the IAA should change significantly (*p&lt;0.005, Moore\u2019s test, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,G</a>; predictions shown in black, tick indicating that we predict that the IAA should change and cross indicating that the IAA should not change. The green dots indicate that the prediction is correct and the score is 1 in that case. The red dots indicate that the prediction is wrong and the score is 0 in that case. The collated scores are at the end of the series).We can also predict the direction of this change i.e. for a given change from one temporal frequency value to the other, should the IAA increase or decrease given that we know that the IAA should increase for every increase in temporal frequency values up to 10 cps of optic flow (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,G1</a>; predictions shown in black, upward pointing arrow predicting that the IAA should increase and the downward pointing arrow predicting that the IAA should decrease. The green dots indicate that the prediction is correct and the score is 1 in that case. The red dots indicate that the prediction is wrong and the score is 0 in that case. The collated scores are at the end of the series). To test for the significance of this score, we scrambled the same dataset randomly so that there is no trend in the IAA values. We repeated the same process for this scrambled dataset. For all the individuals in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E\u00a0and\u00a0F</a>, our scores are significantly different from their scrambled datasets (*p&lt;0.001; Student\u2019s T test) both in terms of the threshold and the direction of change in IAA.

In the experiments where we combined airflow and optic flow cues to look at antennal responses, we quantified these responses as the change in IAA (\u0394IAA) from its value in Regime B, in response to step changes in speed of one or both stimulus. In these experiments, our ability to test various combinations of airflow and visual cues was restricted by two factors. First, each trial involving transition from Regime B to Regime A and Regime B to Regime C was performed within a single flight bout. Second, the on board memory of our cameras restricted our recording time to 68 s whereas each combination took a total of 60 s. This left us no more than three combinations that we could explore.

These results provide an instructive example of the integration of two distinct sensory modalities (mechanosensation and vision) for what is likely a reduction in perceptual ambiguity. Previous studies from the senior author and others have shown that antennae play an important role in flight control for many insects. Based on previous evidence, mechanosensation mediated by the Johnston's organ (JO) is important for sensing airspeed. There is also evidence (e.g., from Heran et al.) that JO sensing depends on antennal positioning, and, further, that this positioning depends on flight and wind speed. Altogether, these results make the study of multimodal cues that influence antennal positioning interesting. Rather than further clarifying the precise function of antennal positioning, the authors use inter-antennal angle (IAA) as an experimental tool to infer the insect's perception of its own speed. They then dissect the role of the two modalities in shaping the percept by monitoring antennal position while manipulating the bee's access to the distinct cues. The findings are in general well supported by the data and should be of interest to biologists who study multisensory integration and multimodal perception."
