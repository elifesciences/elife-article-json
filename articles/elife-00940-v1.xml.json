However, in vitro production of progeny that secrete insulin in response to physiological cues from primary human cells has proven elusive. Here we describe fractionation, expansion and conversion of primary adult human pancreatic ductal cells into progeny resembling native \u03b2-cells. FACS-sorted adult human ductal cells clonally expanded as spheres in culture, while retaining ductal characteristics. Expression of the cardinal islet developmental regulators Neurog3, MafA, Pdx1 and Pax6 converted exocrine duct cells into endocrine progeny with hallmark \u03b2-cell properties, including the ability to synthesize, process and store insulin, and secrete it in response to glucose or other depolarizing stimuli. These studies provide evidence that genetic reprogramming of expandable human pancreatic cells with defined factors may serve as a general strategy for islet replacement in diabetes."

However, in vitro production of progeny that secrete insulin in response to physiological cues from primary human cells has proven elusive. Here we describe fractionation, expansion and conversion of primary adult human pancreatic ductal cells into progeny resembling native \u03b2-cells. FACS-sorted adult human ductal cells clonally expanded as spheres in culture, while retaining ductal characteristics. Expression of the cardinal islet developmental regulators Neurog3, MafA, Pdx1 and Pax6 converted exocrine duct cells into endocrine progeny with hallmark \u03b2-cell properties, including the ability to synthesize, process and store insulin, and secrete it in response to glucose or other depolarizing stimuli. These studies provide evidence that genetic reprogramming of expandable human pancreatic cells with defined factors may serve as a general strategy for islet replacement in diabetes."

                        "text": "The pancreas is a vital organ with exocrine and endocrine cell functions, and a root of lethal human diseases including diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Exocrine acinar cells produce digestive zymogens that are delivered to the intestines by a branching network of exocrine ductal cells that secrete bicarbonate and other products. Pancreatic endocrine functions derive from clusters of epithelial cells (islets of Langerhans) called \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b4-, and PP-cells that respectively synthesize, store, and secrete the hormones Glucagon, Insulin, Somatostatin, and Pancreatic polypeptide (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benitez et al., 2012</a>). Insulin production by islet \u03b2-cells is highly regulated: key features of mature \u03b2-cells include preproinsulin (<i>INS</i>) transcription, proinsulin processing by endo- and exo-peptidases and storage of the proinsulin cleavage products insulin and C-peptide in dense core vesicles. Likewise, cardinal \u03b2-cell functions regulate insulin release in response to glucose and other secretagogues, including glucose sensing and metabolism through the enzyme glucokinase, and use of ATP-dependent potassium channels (K<sub>ATP</sub>) and voltage-gated calcium channels to induce insulin exocytosis (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib50\">Suckale and Solimena, 2010</a>). Deficiency or malfunctioning of \u03b2-cells produces impaired glucose regulation and diabetes mellitus, a disease with autoimmune (type 1, T1DM) and pandemic forms (type 2; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ashcroft and Rorsman, 2012</a>). Thus, replacement or regeneration of functional human \u03b2-cells is an intensely-sought goal."

Because of their expandability and multipotency, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been explored as sources of replacement insulin-producing cells (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib19\">Hebrok, 2012</a>). However, directing the differentiation of these developmentally \u2018primitive\u2019 cells through multiple sequential fates into \u03b2-cell-like progeny that synthesize, process, store, and secrete insulin while lacking tumorigenic potential has challenged investigators worldwide (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fujikawa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">McKnight et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cheng et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, different hESC and iPSC cell lines exhibit significant variability during development into insulin-producing cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nostro and Keller, 2012</a>). Recent work demonstrated that differentiated cell types in adult organs, including the mouse pancreas, can be experimentally \u2018reprogrammed\u2019 into progeny resembling islet cells, suggesting a new strategy for \u03b2-cell replacement (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vierbuchen and Wernig, 2011</a>). For example, adult mouse pancreatic acinar cells can be converted into insulin-producing cells in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib34\">Minami et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>). However, little progress has been made in reprogramming primary human epithelial cells into different cell types, including conversion of pancreatic non-\u03b2-cells toward a human \u03b2-cell fate (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vierbuchen and Wernig, 2011</a>). Thus, systems permitting expansion and genetic modulation of human pancreatic cells could powerfully influence studies of \u03b2-cell biology and replacement."

During pancreas development, fetal endocrine cells derive from primitive ductal epithelium (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib39\">Pan and Wright, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pictet and Rutter, 1972</a>). In addition, some studies have suggested that in adult mice, \u03b2-cells may be produced from pancreatic ductal epithelium (<a href=\"#bib24\">Inada et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Xu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rovira et al., 2010</a>). However, recent lineage tracing evidences have not supported this view (<a href=\"#bib48\">Solar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Furuyama et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kopp et al., 2011</a>). In humans, prior studies have suggested that adult human primary ductal cells in heterogeneous cell mixtures may harbor the potential to generate endocrine-like progeny (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bonner-Weir et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Heremans et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Swales et al., 2012</a>), but interpretation in these studies was limited by the probability of islet cell contamination. Therefore, the potential for conversion of pancreatic ductal cells toward an endocrine fate remains unclear. Moreover, prior studies have revealed only limited proliferative capacity of primary human pancreatic ductal cells in culture (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rescan et al., 2005</a>). Thus, despite their relative abundance, multiple practical issues have prevented development of human pancreatic ductal cells as a source of replacement \u03b2-cells."

Together these studies reveal a new system for investigating human pancreatic duct cell biology, genetics, and \u03b2-cell regeneration."

With primary cells plated at low density, we observed formation of multicellular epithelial spheres, when cultured in Matrigel with a serum-free culture medium without feeder cells (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The multicellular sphere formation suggested primary cell expansion, so based on this assay we fractionated cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate and characterize sphere-forming pancreatic cells. A survey of cell surface markers used for fetal mouse pancreatic cell isolation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sugiyama et al., 2007</a>) revealed that antibodies recognizing CD133 enriched sphere-forming cells by four fold, whereas sphere-forming cells were depleted in the CD133<sup>neg</sup> fraction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Immunohistochemical analysis of the human adult pancreas revealed CD133 expression at the apical portion of duct epithelial cells that co-expressed keratin 19 (KRT19), whereas CD133 was undetectable in islet endocrine cells or acinar cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), consistent with prior reports (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lardon et al., 2008</a>).

Time-lapse imaging revealed that spheres arose from single cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), providing strong evidence that sphere formation resulted from CD133<sup>+</sup> ductal cell proliferation, rather than through cell migration and aggregation. Enzymatic dispersion of 2-week-old G1 spheres and subsequent culture revealed that the spheres can be passaged up to seven generations (G7, 3 months) and that the total number of cells increased with each generation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

                                "text": "The endocrine potential of human or mouse pancreatic ductal cells remains controversial. To investigate the potential of purified human pancreatic ductal cells to achieve an endocrine fate, we used an adenovirus-mediated transgenic system. <i>Neurog3</i> is a transcription factor necessary and sufficient for pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gradwohl et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gu et al., 2002</a>) and, combined with other factors, can induce pancreatic acinar-to-islet cell conversion in mice (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>). To test if <i>Neurog3</i> expression could respecify human duct cells toward an endocrine fate, we infected cultured spheres as well as primary CD133<sup>+</sup> cells with recombinant adenovirus co-expressing red fluorescent protein and <i>Neurog3</i> (Ad-RFP-Neurog3), and assessed changes in gene expression by qRT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C and 4C</a>). <i>Neurog3</i> induced the expression of <i>NEUROD1, INSM1</i>, and <i>RFX6</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), genes whose mouse homologs are known direct targets of <i>Neurog3</i> in pancreas development (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mellitzer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Smith et al., 2010</a>). Ad-RFP-Neurog3 infection induced expression of the pan-endocrine markers chromogranin A (<i>CHGA</i>) and synaptophysin in both primary CD133<sup>+</sup> duct cells and cultured spheres (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C and 4C</a>, and data not shown). Ad-RFP-Neurog3 infection also induced expression of mRNA encoding PAX4 and NKX2.2, transcriptional regulators of pancreatic endocrine cell fate (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sosa-Pineda et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sussel et al., 1998</a>), and mRNA encoding crucial \u03b2-cell factors such as the prohormone processing enzymes <i>PCSK1</i> (PC1/3) and <i>PCSK2</i> (PC2), K<sub>ATP</sub> channel components <i>KCNJ11</i> (KIR6.2) and <i>ABCC8</i> (SUR1), and glucokinase (<i>GCK</i>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Moreover, Ad-RFP-Neurog3 significantly induced mRNA encoding the pancreatic hormones ghrelin and somatostatin, but not mRNAs encoding insulin, glucagon, PPY or the intestinal hormones cholecystokinin and gastrin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C and 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, and data not shown).

Therefore, we next assessed the possibility that the 70% of RFP<sup>+</sup> cells infected by Ad-RFP-Neurog3 failing to express CHGA may have achieved inadequate levels of Neurog3 expression. We fractionated cells produced by Ad-RFP-Neurog3 infection by RFP intensity and measured mRNA expression of Neurog3, CHGA, SST and GHRL by qRT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>). We found that cell fractions with the highest levels of RFP expression (\u2018P4 and P5\u2019, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) had the highest levels of mouse <i>Neurog3</i> mRNA, and only these cell fractions produced mRNA encoding CHGA, SST or GHRL (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). These data suggest that relatively high threshold levels of Neurog3 may be necessary and sufficient for directing endocrine differentiation of human pancreatic cells."

We constructed three adenoviruses expressing <i>MafA</i>, <i>Neurog3,</i> or <i>Pdx1</i> (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and infected cultured spheres with this MNP combination. Within 5 days after infection, we reproducibly detected <i>INS</i> mRNA induction but at extremely low levels relative to adult human islet controls (0.0035 \u00b1 0.0012% of islet levels; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, we sought additional factors and discovered that mRNA encoding PAX6<i>,</i> an important regulator of mouse pancreatic endocrine cell development (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sander et al., 1997</a>), was induced by MNP to only 0.03% of levels in control islets (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). When combined with <i>MafA</i>, <i>Neurog3,</i> and <i>Pdx1</i> (encoded in four viruses, \u20184V\u2019), <i>Pax6</i> induced <i>INS</i> expression in primary CD133<sup>+</sup> ductal cells or spheres by over 30-fold relative to MNP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C,D</a>). We observed ductal conversion to IPCs with four consecutive, independent donors (<i>INS</i>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We also detected substantially increased expression of other islet endocrine markers, including <i>SST, GCK, PCSK1, KCNJ11</i>, and <i>ABCC8</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that the number of Insulin<sup>+</sup> cells was increased by 18 to 20-fold in spheres transduced by the four factor combination (4V) compared to the MNP combination (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>). ELISA studies quantified and confirmed this increase of proinsulin levels, showing that the spheres derived from 4V exposure contained proinsulin levels that averaged 0.7% of those in human islets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Systematic removal of individual factors from this four virus combination revealed that omission of <i>Neurog3</i> prevented expression of <i>INS</i>, <i>CHGA</i> or <i>SST</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Omission of virus expressing <i>MafA</i> or <i>Pax6</i> from this combination significantly reduced <i>INS</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a>), whereas omission of virus expressing <i>Pdx1</i> did not significantly decrease <i>INS</i> expression. Thus, <i>Neurog3</i>-mediated endocrine cell conversion is required for the production of IPCs as well as other hormone-producing cells from ductal spheres."

Compared to baseline secretion in media with 0.1 mM glucose, IPCs increased insulin C-peptide secretion by 2.4-fold upon exposure to 2 mM glucose (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Similar to insulin release by human islet \u03b2-cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lupi et al., 1999</a>), glucose stimulated the secretion of approximately 4% of total insulin C-peptide in IPCs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). This effect was blocked when the cells were incubated with glucose and Diazoxide, a drug that opens K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and prevents glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). However, unlike adult human islet \u03b2-cells, the release of insulin by IPCs was not further increased by 11 mM glucose. Islets from fetal or neonatal stages do not show elevated insulin secretion by high level glucose challenge (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rozzo et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that IPCs are similar to immature islet \u03b2-cells and that further maturation is possible (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Calcium and voltage-dependent calcium channels are important regulators of normal insulin secretion after K<sub>ATP</sub> channel-mediated membrane depolarization in \u03b2-cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Henquin, 2005</a>). When calcium was omitted in secretion buffer, C-peptide secretion stimulated by glucose was abolished, but restored upon calcium addition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Insulin C-peptide release by cultured IPCs was also induced by the depolarizing agent potassium chloride (30 mM KCl), an effect reversed by a subsequent wash in media with 4.8 mM potassium ion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). Treatment with tolbutamide, a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel blocker causing membrane depolarization, also stimulated insulin secretion by IPCs, an effect prevented by omission of calcium (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Together with data showing expression of key regulators of stimulus-secretion coupling, these findings provide strong evidence that IPCs produced by conversion and extended culture in our system develop regulated insulin secretion."

Thus, it has remained unknown whether human cells can develop solely in vitro to generate glucose-responsive insulin-secreting progeny without tumorigenicity.

We were unable to culture and expand primary human pancreatic acinar cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and data not shown); moreover, we found that the combination of these three genes (MNP) was insufficient to reprogram primary or expanded human pancreatic ductal cells toward a \u03b2-cell fate, suggesting transgenic conversion may be restricted by species and cell type. Thus, we postulated that additional transcriptional regulators might be needed to promote human ductal conversion toward a \u03b2-cell fate. Like Neurog3, MafA, and Pdx1, the transcription factor Pax6 is expressed in both fetal and adult pancreas, and required to achieve appropriately high levels of <i>Ins</i> and <i>Gcg</i> expression in mouse islet cell development (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sander et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pan and Wright, 2011</a>).

Thus, unlike mouse acinar cells (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>) and human hepatocytes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sapir et al., 2005</a>), human ductal cells do not require exogenous Pdx1 expression for conversion toward an endocrine fate, for reasons that remain unclear.

During pancreas development, Neurog3 level surges in a subset of pancreatic progenitors located in primitive ducts, inducing development of endocrine cell fates (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Miyatsuka et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, based on this model, we attempted to mimic induction of Neurog3 in human ductal cells using adenoviral overexpression of <i>Neurog3</i>. We found that Neurog3 was necessary and sufficient for reprogramming human ductal cells, and that the level of ectopic <i>Neurog3</i> mRNA expressed in ductal cells correlated well with the extent of endocrine reprogramming, including expression of islet hormones (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). These findings are reminiscent of studies by Gu et al. showing that reduced <i>Neurog3</i> gene dosage in mice leads to respecification of pancreatic endocrine progenitors into ductal and acinar cells (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Thus, <i>Neurog3</i> functions may be evolutionarily conserved in allocating cells toward an exocrine or endocrine fate (whether in development or experimental cell conversion) in a dosage-dependent manner. Consistent with prior work revealing that Neurog3 attenuates islet cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Miyatsuka et al., 2011</a>), we did not observe multiple rounds of cell division, an important prerequisite for some de-differentiation events (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hanna et al., 2009</a>), during Neurog3-dependent cell conversion. Also, we observed <i>Neurog3</i> induction alone can rapidly upregulate endocrine molecular signatures in cultured human ductal cells. Thus endocrine cell conversion described here may involve direct conversion of human ductal cells into endocrine cells, rather than de-differentiation, but additional studies are required to assess this possibility. Our findings, albeit with enforced transcription factor expression in adult cells, indicate that Neurog3 expression is sufficient to induce latent endocrine programs in human adult ductal cells, a capacity not yet clearly demonstrated, to our knowledge."

We speculate that our cell culture system may also serve as the foundation to investigate the genetics and pathogenesis of diverse human diseases rooted in pancreatic ductal cells, including pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and adenocarcinoma."

For transplantation in kidney or EFP, converted spheres with or without extended culture were harvested and mixed with or without mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). The spheres were then mixed with matrigel to make a final volume of 10 \u00b5l for kidney transplantation or overlayed on pre-wet gelfoam for EFP transplantation. For liver transplantation, single cells produced by trypsinization of harvested spheres were resuspended in 100 \u00b5l PBS and injected into the portal vein with a 27 G needle. All animal experiments and methods were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Stanford University."

The cells were either trypsinized for suspension infection (as was described above for ductal spheres) or infected as adherent cells in six-well plates by direct addition of virus into the culture medium, with Ad-eGFP (GFP) or Ad-eGFP-M6P and Ad-Neurog3-IRES-eGFP (4TFM). The same MOIs used for ductal sphere infection were also used. The suspension-infected cells were harvested the following day and embedded in Matrigel as described above for infected ductal spheres. The culture was maintained for additional 18 days to match the duration of infected ductal sphere maturation. The infected adherent cells were cultured with virus for 48 hr and the media was replaced. The culture was maintained for additional 10 days, passaged in 1:3 ratio due to confluency, re-plated, and cultured additional 7 days to match the duration of infected ductal sphere maturation. In both cases, media was replaced every other day. Three independent experiments were performed for both conditions and each experiment at least in duplicates. RNA isolation, cDNA preparation, and qRT-PCR were performed with primers specific to human <i>INS</i>, <i>CHGA</i>, and \u03b2-actin as described above."

While they all feel that the experiments are carefully carried out, and the data presented are robust, in the end they were not convinced that the study as a whole provided a major step forward in the drive towards generating functional beta cells from other cell types. It was noted that you have not demonstrated whether the use of ductal cells (CD133<sup>+</sup> cells) is advantageous over the use of other cell types for transdifferentiation. What would happen if the same factors were used to reprogram other cell types, even non-pancreatic cells, such as fibroblasts? The fact that ductal cells can respond to exogenous transcription factors does not directly demonstrate that these cells have latent potential to form beta cells, as claimed in the Abstract. It was also noted that the beta cells produced are not apparently fully mature and, therefore, the long-term significance of this approach for human therapy is unclear. The ability to grow human ductal cells in vitro is interesting and a further analysis of the non-transduced cells to respond to external signals and undergo differentiation into different cell types would be interesting."

The major points from the full reviews are provided below."

They then show that they can generate clonal spheres from these cells that can be passaged several generations in culture. They then infect these cultures with adenovirus expressing first neurogenin and then additional sets of beta cell inducing transcription factors and show that they can induce expression of endocrine phenotypes in the spheres and that a combination of 4 factors generates insulin-producing cells that show some degree of glucose regulation. The final most successful converted cells express 7% of the levels of insulin found in adult islets, but when transplanted to the kidney capsule in mice, they were able to detect some human insulin in serum. However, in these grafts cell survival was poor, so they were unable to test the ability of the cells to rescue diabetic mice."

On average the authors are able to generate 10% insulin+ cells that resemble fetal beta cells, as they secrete insulin in response to low level of glucose (2mM), but fail to respond to higher glucose concentration (11mM). Following transplantation of the reprogrammed spheres into NSG mice, they observed that survival of the graft after transplantation was poor. However, they were able to detect human insulin in the serum of the host mice and showed that insulin levels increased after glucose challenge, suggesting in vivo maturation, albeit few mice were analysed.

However, these cells develop largely as poly-hormonal cells (most frequently expressing both glucagon and insulin) and fail to secrete insulin in response to glucose or other secretagogues unless transplanted for &gt;2 months in mice (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib38\">Nostro and Keller, 2012</a>). Thus, it has remained unknown whether human cells can develop solely in vitro to generate glucose-responsive insulin-secreting progeny and without tumorigenicity. Our data indicate that in principle this can be achieved.

With the same 4TFM condition and Insulin or ChromograninA (ChgA) mRNA levels as readouts, we detected no clear evidence of conversion toward an endocrine or \u03b2-cell fate (n \u2265 6 from 3 independent experiments: <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 4</a>; see Materials and Methods for details). This indicates that human adult dermal fibroblasts have little to no ?-cell conversion potential. Despite repeated attempts, we were unable to assess the conversion property of human acinar cells due to their inability to grow in culture (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> CD133-negative population), consistent with other reports that primary acinar cells are difficult to culture.

Thus, the current method does not permit 'pulse' expression of the factors. Transgenes delivered by adenovirus do not generally persist long term (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>), especially in dividing cells. Persistent transgene expression noted in our study likely results from the known ability of Neurog3 to induce cell cycle exit (<a href=\"#bib35\">Miyatsuka et al., 2011</a>), thereby preventing dilution of transgenes and transgene-encoded factors by cell division. This precluded tests to demonstrate independence of the transgene-encoded factors for ongoing maintenance of the converted-cell phenotypes observed. We also agree with the reviewer that it is possible the continuous presence of some of the factors may prevent full differentiation toward more physiologically-mature endocrine cells. However, we do not feel these limitations change the main conclusions of our study. We have included a discussion of these points in our revised manuscript."
