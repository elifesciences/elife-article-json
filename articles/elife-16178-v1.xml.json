Here we report the first results of widefield imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP6f) signals from V1 of behaving macaques. This technique provides a robust readout of visual population responses at the columnar scale over multiple mm<sup>2</sup> and over several months. To determine the quantitative relation between the widefield GCaMP signals and the locally pooled spiking activity, we developed a computational model that sums the responses of V1 neurons characterized by prior single unit measurements. The measured tuning properties of the GCaMP signals to stimulus contrast, orientation and spatial position closely match the predictions of the model, suggesting that widefield GCaMP signals are linearly related to the summed local spiking activity."

Here we report the first results of widefield imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP6f) signals from V1 of behaving macaques. This technique provides a robust readout of visual population responses at the columnar scale over multiple mm<sup>2</sup> and over several months. To determine the quantitative relation between the widefield GCaMP signals and the locally pooled spiking activity, we developed a computational model that sums the responses of V1 neurons characterized by prior single unit measurements. The measured tuning properties of the GCaMP signals to stimulus contrast, orientation and spatial position closely match the predictions of the model, suggesting that widefield GCaMP signals are linearly related to the summed local spiking activity."

To understand what happens in a human brain, it is necessary to study a brain of similar complexity, such as that of a primate. Examining how the neurons in a brain region called the visual cortex process information about what we see is especially informative. This is because animals can be taught to perform different visual tasks, and because the visual cortex is relatively easy to access. In principle, therefore, it should be possible to use modern genetic and imaging techniques to study the primate visual system, but, until now, that has not been the case."

One way to study how these different classes of neurons interact with each other is to alter the animal\u2019s DNA, such that only one cell type stands out during the experiment, allowing its role in the brain to be closely monitored. This technique has been used to study the interactions among neurons in the rodent brain, because rodent DNA is easy to alter. However, it is not easy to manipulate primate DNA."

The method uses specially designed harmless viruses to produce foreign proteins in the excitatory neurons of the visual cortex in an adult macaque. The optical properties of the proteins change when the neuron they are in is active, allowing the activity of the excitatory neurons to be detected and tracked in awake animals while they perform a visual task."

Current techniques for measuring neural activity in behaving animals suffer from a fundamental tradeoff between resolution (spatial and temporal) and coverage, such that, even in a simple perceptual task with a localized stimulus, no single technique can measure the activity of all potentially relevant neurons in a given cortical area with single neuron resolution. Therefore, to advance our understanding of the neural basis of behavior, we need to (i) complement techniques that provide single-neuron access over a limited region with techniques that capture neural population responses over a large region, and (ii) develop computational tools that describe the mapping between neural signals measured using different techniques and combined across different spatial scales."

To do this, we took advantage of our expertise in long-term maintenance (&gt;6 months) of a large (18\u2009mm diameter) cortical window with direct physical and optical access to the awake macaque brain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). With this window, it is possible to test in parallel more than a dozen combinations of vectors and injection parameters. Initial injections were performed with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)\u00a0to test recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) serotypes and promoters that have proven effective in the rodent (see Experimental Procedures). Following injection, each chamber was monitored weekly with epi-fluorescence imaging to track transgene expression levels. Injection sites were easily tracked based on high magnification images of the vasculature. Based on preliminary measurements, we selected serotype 1 rAAVs and CaMKII\u03b1 promoter (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dittgen et al., 2004</a>) for expressing GCaMP. Glass micropipettes were used to inject small volumes (1\u20132 \u00b5L) of rAAV:CaMKII-GCaMP6f into V1 of three macaque monkeys. Six to seven weeks post-injection, high levels of transgene expression could be observed over an area of ~6\u201310\u00a0mm<sup>2</sup> per injection site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Based on in situ hybridization analysis of gene expression at the injection site in one animal, approximately 80 percent of cells were CaMKII\u03b1-positive and, therefore, excitatory. Further, all neurons expressing GCaMP were CaMKII\u03b1-positive, attesting to the fidelity of the viral promoter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). There was no evidence of apoptotic neurons, as judged by Hoechst 33342 staining 10 weeks post-injection (not shown). Once GCaMP fluorescence had been detected, we used widefield epi-fluorescence imaging to characterize the nature of the GCaMP signals carried by populations of V1 neurons while the monkeys performed a fixation task."

As expected from the known structure of orientation maps in V1, the pairwise correlations changed smoothly from positive values for maps produced by nearby orientations to negative values for maps produced by orthogonal orientations. We used the maps produced by each orientation to compute the composite orientation map, in which color indicates the preferred orientation and saturation the strength of orientation tuning (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

Even if the GCAMP signals are dominated by spikes, it can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to predict properties of population responses from single-unit measurements (e.g., <a href=\"#bib44\">Seidemann et al., 2009</a>).

The orientation tuning curve contains an orientation selective component and a large non-selective component, reflecting the fact that the local GCaMP signal pools responses from an area with a heterogeneous population of neurons (see below). Next, we examined how V1 responses in the same region change as a function of stimulus contrast (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). The response was weak at low contrasts (&lt;12%) and increased monotonically at higher contrasts. Finally, to examine position tuning, we measured GCaMP responses in a small ROI to localized Gabor stimuli (sine-wave grating in a Gaussian window) presented at different distances from the ROI\u2019s location in the visual field.

We used the retinotopic map to estimate, for each stimulus position, the cortical distance (in mm) between the center of the region activated by the stimulus and the center of our ROI. The GCaMP responses dropped rapidly as the stimulus\u2019 representation deviated from the recorded ROI\u2019s location, and no responses were observed when the distance exceeded 2\u2009mm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Similar GCaMP tuning curves for contrast, position and orientation were observed across multiple experiments spanning several months in two monkeys (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>, blue symbols; thin blue curves show results from two monkeys separately)."

Due to the threshold nonlinearity between membrane potential and spiking activity in single neurons (<a href=\"#bib39\">Priebe and Ferster, 2008</a>), stimuli that produce weak or moderate membrane potential response elicit almost no spiking activity. Therefore, the spiking responses of V1 neurons are more narrowly tuned for orientation and position and are less sensitive to low contrasts (<a href=\"#bib39\">Priebe and Ferster, 2008</a>). In addition, the spike threshold nonlinearity causes spiking activity to have a smaller non-orientation-selective response relative to membrane potential (<a href=\"#bib39\">Priebe and Ferster, 2008</a>). Therefore, if the GCaMP signal measures primarily the locally pooled spiking activity, then\u00a0we would expect GCaMP responses to be less sensitive to contrast, more narrowly tuned to orientation and position, and to have a smaller non-orientation-selective response than VSD signals. A comparison of VSD (red symbols, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>; thin red curves show results from two monkeys separately) and GCaMP responses is largely consistent with these predictions, suggesting that the GCaMP signal may be proportional to the locally summed spiking activity."

This model capitalizes on the extensive measurements of single neuron activity that have been made in primate V1 over the last 40 years. Specifically, much is known about the distributions of the tuning properties of V1 neurons, as well as their functional organization (e.g., <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nauhaus et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Van Essen et al., 1984</a>), making it possible for us to construct the model directly from single neuron measurements made by us and others. In the model, the membrane potential of neuron <i>i</i> is controlled by its linear receptive field (<i>L<sub>i</sub></i>) and a contrast gain control mechanism, where gain decreases monotonically with contrast at a rate that is controlled by a semi-saturation parameter (<math id=\"inf1\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msub><mi>C</mi><mrow><msub><mn>50</mn><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>). Spikes are obtained by passing the membrane potential through a power-law spiking nonlinearity having an exponent <i>n<sub>s</sub></i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Priebe and Ferster, 2008</a>). This is the standard descriptive model that has been used to summarize the response properties of single neurons in V1 (e.g., <a href=\"#bib2\">Adelson and Bergen, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Albrecht and Geisler, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Heeger, 1992</a>)."

The relative contribution to the sum of a neuron with a particular receptive field center is given by a spatial scatter function (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, top). Similarly, to obtain the predicted orientation tuning function we assume that individual neurons have the average orientation bandwidth of V1 neurons (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and that the response at a given location reflects the summed activity of a population of V1 neurons with different preferred orientations. The relative contribution to the sum of neurons with a particular preferred orientation is given by an orientation scatter function (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, top). The position and orientation scatter functions reflect multiple factors that contribute to the broadening of the population tuning relative to that of single neurons (see Experimental Procedures). Due to the fine spatial scale of orientation maps (period of ~0.7\u2009mm; (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1963</a>) and their semi-periodic nature, orientation scatter has a particularly large impact on the population orientation tuning curves.

The stimulus was presented for six cycles at 4\u2009Hz (100 ms on, 150 ms off). Clear modulation to each stimulus presentation can be seen, but because the GCaMP signal does not return to baseline between presentations, the response builds up across the six\u00a0stimulus presentations. <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a> shows the response collapsed across the six cycles. <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C\u2013D</a> show the average time course of the VSD signal in the 10 experiments used to determine orientation selectivity of VSD signals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, red symbols). The stimulus was presented for five cycles at 5\u2009Hz (60 ms on, 140 ms off). The VSD signal appears to rise and decay more rapidly, and does not show the same degree of buildup as the GCaMP signal. To compare the dynamics of the rising and falling edges of the GCaMP and VSD responses, we collapsed the responses across cycles, normalized the responses to their peak, and superimposed the GCaMP and VSD responses (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). The latency of the VSD signal is shorter than the latency of the GCaMP signal. Similarly, the slope of the rising edge of the VSD signal is steeper than the slope of the rising edge of the GCaMP signal. Direct comparison of the slope and time-to-peak between these measurements is somewhat problematic because of the differences in the stimulus presentation protocol. To examine the dynamics of the falling edges, we aligned the two signals to the time of their peak (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>, right). The GCaMP signal falls off more slowly than the VSD signal, consistent with the differences in the buildup."

This method provides high quality access to neural population activity at the scale of cortical columns. We measured the tuning properties of the GCaMP signals and compared them with those of VSD signals. We found that GCaMP signals are less sensitive to contrast and are more selective to position and orientation than VSD signals. We then developed a simple computational framework for modeling the relation between neural signals measured with different techniques and at different spatial scales. We used this framework to test the hypothesis that widefield GCaMP and VSD signals in V1 of behaving monkeys reflect the linearly summed local neural population activity at the level spiking activity and membrane potential, respectively. The general agreement between the model\u2019s predictions and our empirical results supports this hypothesis and provides means to link neural signals measured at different spatial scales and with different techniques."

Chronic widefield imaging of genetically encoded indicators provides a promising approach to achieve this important goal. Our study represents several key advancements over a recent study using similar techniques in anesthetized ferrets (<a href=\"#bib46\">Smith et al., 2015</a>). First, our experiments are performed in behaving primates that are an important and widely used model system. Second, we perform longitudinal measurements over several months, rather than acute experiments. Third, we develop a computational model that quantitatively links widefield measurements with single unit measurements and provides evidence that the widefield GCaMP signals are dominated by the summed spiking activity of local populations of neurons."

GCaMP imaging offers several advantages over other widefield imaging techniques in behaving animals. The amplitude of the GCaMP signal is nearly\u00a0an order of magnitude larger than that of VSD or intrinsic imaging\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). The GCAMP signal has much higher temporal resolution than intrinsic imaging (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), although somewhat less than VSD imaging\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). In GCaMP imaging, a single viral injection procedure generates stable expression of a calcium indicator for many months (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This eliminates the need for a repeated, challenging and variable-quality staining procedures necessary for VSD imaging. GCaMP signals are also less susceptible to bleaching than VSD signals, accommodating longer and more frequent imaging sessions. Thus, GCaMP imaging can be used to monitor the same cortical region over multiple months in behaving subjects, enabling new types of experiments, such as studies comparing neural and behavioral sensitivities in perceptual tasks with large ensembles of complex and naturalistic stimuli. Thus, chronic widefield GCaMP imaging in behaving animals is likely to become a widely used and powerful technique."

Had the GCaMP widefield signal been dominated by synaptic potentials in dendrites or pre-synaptic inputs, their tuning properties should have matched those obtained with VSD. The large and consistent differences between the tuning properties of the widefield GCaMP and VSD signals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), and the match between the model\u2019s predictions and the observed tuning properties (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), support the conclusion that the widefield GCaMP signal is tightly linked to the local spikes in layer 2/3. However, this result does not imply a lack of contribution from dendrites to the widefield GCaMP signal. Comparably tuned dendritic and somatic GCaMP6 signals have been recorded in rodent V1 using two-photon imaging (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2013</a>), and we have obtained similar results in two-photon GCaMP6 experiments in macaque V1 (Nauhaus, Ko, Chen and Seidemann, unpublished observations). Therefore, stimulus-evoked dendritic GCaMP signals may be more correlated with the spiking output of layer 2/3 cells than with their synaptic inputs. Factors promoting dendritic GCaMP signals with tuning properties that are more similar to the spiking output than to the synaptic input could include backpropagating action potentials (<a href=\"#bib28\">Larkum et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Waters et al., 2003</a>), as well as nonlinear dendritic NMDA mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib29\">Major et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Xu et al., 2012</a>). Another important factor that is likely to contribute to the differences between the tuning properties of the widefield GCaMP and VSD signals is that the VSD signal is proportional to membrane surface area, while the GCaMP signal is proportional to cytosolic volume."

Combining widefield and two-photon GCaMP imaging in the same animal over extended periods of time should help resolve many of the remaining questions regarding the relationship between neural responses measured over different spatial scales. Combining complementary empirical measurements with realistic computational models that interpolate fine-scale and large-scale measurements will provide unprecedented access to distributed neural responses in behaving subjects, leading to a deeper understanding of neural population coding in the brain."

Following injection, each chamber was monitored weekly with epi-fluorescence imaging to track transgene expression levels. Injection sites were easily tracked based on high magnification images of the vasculature. Initial test infections were performed using serotype 1, 8, and 9 rAAVs encoding a mouse synapsin promoter and EGFP. Viruses were assembled using a helper-free system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), and purified on sequential cesium gradients according to published methods (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grieger et al., 2006</a>). Viral titers were measured using a payload-independent quantitation technique (<a href=\"#bib8\">Aurnhammer et al., 2012</a>). Typical titers were &gt;10<sup>10</sup> genomes/microliter. To aid injection monitoring, 0.4% trypan blue (w/v) was diluted 1:10 in aCSF and added into the viral suspension. Injections were performed while the monkey was awake using methods similar to those recently developed for intracellular recording from behaving monkeys (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tan et al., 2014</a>). A pulled glass needle (15 \u00b5m tip diameter) containing the suspension was lowered under surgical microscope guidance through an opening in the imaging chamber, puncturing the pia. Injection depths were measured from the point of contact between needle and brain surface. Virus was deposited at depths of 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5\u2009mm (0.5 \u00b5l per site) using a positive displacement microinjector (Nanoject II). With the injector in slow mode, 0.5 \u00b5l of virus was delivered manually in 10 x 50 nl steps, with approximately 30 s pauses between steps. After virus was delivered, the needle was left in place for 10\u2009min before being withdrawn. The last injection normally produced an easily visualized dye-stained region near the surface of the brain; the region continued to spread laterally in the minutes to hours following the injection, covering 5\u201310 mm<sup>2</sup> of cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Importantly, the depth of the final injection was adjusted, such that staining was visible, but virus was not leaking from the injection site. Test experiments with rAAV:mSYN-EGFP produced regions of EGFP fluorescence (after 1\u20132 weeks) roughly matching the contours of dye patches (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Fluorescence signals associated with rAAV serotypes 1, 8 and 9 were qualitatively similar. Hence, serotype 1 rAAVs was used for the GCaMP experiments."

Viral vectors rAAV:hSYN-GCaMP6f, rAAV:CamKII-GCaMP6f, rAAV:CAG-GCaMP6f were tested. The CAG vector produced high levels of unvarying basal fluorescence, consistent with compromised cell function. rAAV:CamKII-GCaMP6f at a titer of 1.3 x 10<sup>11</sup> viral genomes per microliter produced more robust GCaMP signals than the hSYN vector, and was, therefore, used for all experiments reported here. Future studies, including two-photon imaging, will more closely examine GCaMP signals obtained with hSYN, CamKII\u03b1 and other cell type-specific promoters. GCaMP fluorescence was observed 40 days following injection, peaking around 75 days, and remained constant for up to 190 days after injection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The decrease in signal quality beyond this period was primarily caused by general deterioration of the health of the chamber.

To obtain fluid reward, monkeys had to maintain fixation within a small window (&lt;2 deg full width) centered on a small fixation point for 2\u20134 s. Eye position was monitored by an infrared eye tracker (Dr. Bouis or EyeLink). To measure contrast and orientation tuning, we used a large sine wave grating (6\u00a0x\u00a06 deg<sup>2</sup>) centered over the receptive fields of the infected neurons. For position tuning we used a small Gabor patch (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a01/6\u00b0; spatial frequency 2 cpd) presented along a linear trajectory at different distances in the visual field from the average receptive field of the neurons within a small ROI. For contrast and position tuning, visual stimuli were flashed 2\u20133 times per trial at 2\u2009Hz (200 ms on; 300 ms off). Widefield measures of population responses with GCaMP and VSD contain a large non-orientation-selective component (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2F</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6C</a>). Because the orientation selective signals are small, we had to increase our SNR in order to obtain high quality orientation maps and orientation-tuning curves. To increase the SNR, gratings were flashed at 4\u2009Hz (100 on, 150 off) for GCaMP imaging and at 5\u2009Hz (60 ms on, 140 ms off) for VSD imaging, in a period of 1 or 1.5 s. Additional tests verified that maps and tuning curves obtained with VSD at 4 and 5\u2009Hz are identical (data not shown).

Epi-fluorescence imaging was performed with an imaging system (Imager 3001/M, Optical Imaging) using the following filter sets: GCaMP, excitation 470/24\u00a0nm, dichroic 505 nm, emission 515 nm cutoff glass filter; VSD, excitation 620/30\u00a0nm, dichroic 660 nm, emission 665 nm cutoff glass filter). Illumination was obtained with an LED light source (X-Cite120LED) for GCaMP or a QTH lamp (Zeiss) for VSD imaging. Data acquisition was time locked to the animal\u2019s heartbeat. Imaging was performed at 20\u2009Hz for GCaMP imaging and 100\u2009Hz for VSD imaging."

For contrast and position tuning, neural signals were integrated over a 200 ms window starting 35 ms after stimulus onset. For orientation tuning, the response was the first harmonic amplitude obtained by FFT of the temporal response (as in (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). For contrast and orientation tuning of the GCaMP signal, tuning curves were computed over an ROI of 1.6\u00a0x\u00a01.6 mm<sup>2</sup> centered at the location with the maximal d\u2019 (average signal amplitude over signal SD). For VSD, the ROI was the region with d\u2019&gt;3. For position tuning of the GCaMP and VSD signals, the tuning curves were computed over an ROI of 0.75\u00a0x\u00a00.75 mm<sup>2</sup> centered at the retinotopic representation of the center stimulus. Each response curve was normalized by the peak value, then, averaged across experiments and monkeys (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

They find that this is a well written paper which demonstrates the first successful use of genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCAMP, to image neuronal activity on a mm scale in the awake monkey cortex. The authors directly compared widefield calcium imaging with imaging with Voltage Sensitive Dyes (VSD) in response to visual stimulation and used previously developed computational model to convincingly show that while VSD reflect subthreshold synaptic inputs, GCAMP measures spiking activity. Taking advantage of known properties and organization of neurons in area V1, the authors demonstrate that tuning of GCAMP signals to contrast, orientation and spatial position reflects locally pooled spiking activity."

If the question refers to the spread of the trypan blue, then because the dye dissipates long before the virus-encoded proteins are expressed, there is no way to directly superimpose dye and GCaMP fields. However, since the dye is in the viral sample, and the dye field appears during the injection, it is reasonable to assume that the virus infects the brain volume marked by the dye. Panels in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, displaying dye pattern immediately after injection (A) and EGFP fluorescence three months later (B), support this conclusion. If this refers to the point-spread function, we added a sentence indicating that we assume that the point-spread functions of the VSD and GCaMP widefield signals are comparable. Our results appear to be consistent with this assumption."
