We present two crystal structures of engineered U1 sub-structures, which together reveal at atomic resolution an almost complete network of protein\u2013protein and RNA-protein interactions within U1 snRNP, and show how the 5\u2032 splice site of pre-mRNA is recognised by U1 snRNP. The zinc-finger of U1-C interacts with the duplex between pre-mRNA and the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA. The binding of the RNA duplex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between U1-C and the RNA backbone around the splice junction but U1-C makes no base-specific contacts with pre-mRNA. The structure, together with RNA binding assays, shows that the selection of 5\u2032-splice site nucleotides by U1 snRNP is achieved predominantly through basepairing with U1 snRNA whilst U1-C fine-tunes relative affinities of mismatched 5\u2032-splice sites."

We present two crystal structures of engineered U1 sub-structures, which together reveal at atomic resolution an almost complete network of protein\u2013protein and RNA-protein interactions within U1 snRNP, and show how the 5\u2032 splice site of pre-mRNA is recognised by U1 snRNP. The zinc-finger of U1-C interacts with the duplex between pre-mRNA and the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA. The binding of the RNA duplex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between U1-C and the RNA backbone around the splice junction but U1-C makes no base-specific contacts with pre-mRNA. The structure, together with RNA binding assays, shows that the selection of 5\u2032-splice site nucleotides by U1 snRNP is achieved predominantly through basepairing with U1 snRNA whilst U1-C fine-tunes relative affinities of mismatched 5\u2032-splice sites."

Instead, U1 snRNP is able to find the start of the intron because the U1 RNA can stably bind to this site.

This process is catalysed by a large and dynamic RNA-protein assembly called the spliceosome, which consists of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs) and numerous non-snRNP proteins (<a href=\"#bib66\">Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2011</a>). U1 snRNP recognizes a short sequence at the 5\u2032-splice site (5\u2032SS) of pre-mRNA through basepairing between the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA and the 5\u2032SS sequence (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lerner et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhuang and Weiner, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Siliciano and Guthrie, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">S\u00e9raphin et al., 1988</a>) and promotes an ordered assembly of the four remaining snRNPs to form the spliceosome, which then undergoes extensive conformational and compositional remodelings to become catalytically active (<a href=\"#bib66\">Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2011</a>). During activation, the interaction between U1 snRNP and the 5\u2032SS is disrupted by RNA helicase Prp28 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Staley and Guthrie, 1999</a>) and then the 5\u2032SS intron sequence base-pairs with part of the ACAGAGA box in U6 snRNA (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sawa and Abelson, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sawa and Shimura, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wassarman and Steitz, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kandels-Lewis and S\u00e9raphin, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib25a\">Lesser and Guthrie, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sontheimer and Steitz, 1993</a>); whilst the 5\u2032 exon interacts with U5 snRNA loop I for the first <i>trans</i>-esterification reaction (<a href=\"#bib37\">Newman and Norman, 1992</a>).

We reported the structure of the functional core of U1 snRNP (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pomeranz Krummel et al., 2009</a>) based on an experimental electron density map at 5.5 \u00c5 resolution to which we fitted previously-determined structures of protein components (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kambach et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Muto et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Leung, 2005</a>). The most striking feature of the structure is the N-terminal region of U1-70k, which extends from its RRM through a long \u03b1-helix and wraps around the Sm protein assembly so that its N-terminus makes contact with U1-C protein, thus accounting for the requirement of U1-70k for U1-C binding (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nelissen et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hilleren et al., 1995</a>). In this crystal the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA pairs with its symmetry-related counterpart, mimicking the binding of the 5\u2032SS of pre-mRNA to U1 snRNP. The Zn-finger domain of U1-C is located adjacent to this RNA duplex but the low-resolution map was insufficient for analysis of the RNA-protein contacts in atomic detail and hence it was not clear how U1-C contributes to the recognition of the 5\u2032SS. The structure of U1 snRNP from HeLa cells, treated with chymotrypsin, was subsequently reported (<a href=\"#bib64\">Weber et al., 2010</a>). Although this crystal had a DNA oligonucleotide with the 5\u2032SS consensus sequence bound to the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA, the N-terminal end of U1-70k together with U1-C protein were lost by protease treatment. Hence neither of these structures revealed molecular details of 5\u2032SS recognition by U1 snRNP."

However, despite these differences, the sequence of the 5\u2032-single stranded region of U1 snRNA (nts 1\u201310) is invariant from yeast to human (<a href=\"http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/\">http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/</a>) and the amino acid sequence of the Zn-finger of U1-C (yeast Yhc1) is also highly conserved (<a href=\"#bib34\">Muto et al., 2004</a>). Hence the 5\u2032SS of pre-mRNA is expected to make exactly the same contacts with the 5\u2032 end of U1 snRNA and U1-C in human and yeast U1 snRNPs. However, some positions of the 5\u2032SS have quite different nucleotide bias in yeast and human genes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Burge et al., 1999</a>). In human the 5\u2032SS sequences processed by major spliceosomes are degenerate but show significant overall complementarity to the sequence of the 5\u2032 end of U1 snRNA (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lerner et al., 1980</a>). In contrast the 5\u2032SS intron sequence of yeast pre-mRNA is stringently conserved to be GUAUGU (<a href=\"#bib3\">Burge et al., 1999</a>). Upon activation of the yeast spliceosome, the intron sequence, UGU (+4, +5 and +6), pairs with ACA within the ACAGAGA sequence in U6 snRNA and hence these nucleotides are selected to be nearly invariant (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sawa and Abelson, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kandels-Lewis and S\u00e9raphin, 1993</a>). Cross-linking studies revealed interaction of the same regions of U6 snRNA and the 5\u2032SS sequence in human but the sequence requirement is less obvious (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sawa and Shimura, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wassarman and Steitz, 1992</a>). Prp8 is also known to influence the selection of the 5\u2032SS nucleotide (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib13\">Grainger and Beggs (2005)</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Galej et al. (2013)</a>). Furthermore in humans constitutive or alternative splicing factors facilitate the binding of U1 snRNP to weak splice sites. As discussed above, the 5\u2032SS is subjected to multiple selections which differ in yeast and human and give rise to different nucleotide biases at 5\u2032SS. The strength of variant 5\u2032SS sequences is assessed by relative usage of competing 5\u2032SS (<a href=\"#bib49\">Roca et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2012</a>) which is determined not only by the affinity of 5\u2032SS to U1 snRNP but also by multiple factors (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roca et al., 2013</a>)."

Also, by measuring the intrinsic affinity of recombinant U1 snRNP for various 5\u2032SS sequences we disentangle the role played by the U1 snRNP from the other complexities of 5\u2032SS recognition, and assess the relative contributions of U1 snRNA and U1-C protein in light of our crystal structure."

However, this eliminated the binding site (stem-loop I) for the U1-70k RRM (RNA-recognition motif) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Query et al., 1989</a>) and thus weakened the binding of the U1-70k N-terminal peptide to the snRNP core domain (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nelissen et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hilleren et al., 1995</a>).

                        "text": "The structure of the minimal U1 snRNP fits well into the 5.5 \u00c5 electron density except for a slight tilt of the duplex between pre-mRNA and the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pomeranz Krummel et al., 2009</a>). In the previous structure the fortuitous interaction between the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA from two symmetry-related complexes could have distorted the orientation of this RNA duplex. Hence we believe that the minimal U1 snRNP, with the consensus 5\u2032SS oligonucleotide bound to the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA, represents the 5\u2032SS-U1 snRNP interaction in the whole U1 snRNP. The overall structure of the core domain is very similar to that of the U4 snRNP core domain, which consists of seven Sm proteins and U4 snRNA (<a href=\"#bib27\">Leung et al., 2011</a>) and the Sm folds of the seven Sm protein assemblies of the two structures (PDB code: 4PJO and 4WZJ) superimpose with rmsd of 0.55 \u00c5. However, there are some noteworthy differences (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the minimal U1 snRNP, helix H0 of SmD2 points into the minor groove of helix H (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), buttressing it, a feature already evident at 5.5 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pomeranz Krummel et al., 2009</a>). The nonamer Sm site sequence (AAUUUGUGG in U1 snRNA and AAUUUUUGA in U4 snRNA) has been reported as a minimal RNA oligonucleotide to promote Sm core domain assembly (<a href=\"#bib44\">Raker et al., 1999</a>). In U1 snRNP each base of the first seven nucleotides of the nonamer, AAUUUGU (A125 to U131), interacts one-to-one with SmF-SmE-SmG-SmD3-SmB-SmD1-SmD2 in the pockets formed by four key residues at equivalent positions in the L3 and L5 loops of the Sm fold except for the interaction of G130 with SmD1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the protease-treated U1 snRNP structure (<a href=\"#bib64\">Weber et al., 2010</a>), G132 was placed in the nucleotide-binding pocket in SmF but our structure unambiguously shows that A125 occupies this pocket. The U4 core snRNP structure has now been refined to an R<sub>free</sub> of 22.4% (Li, Leung, YK, CO and KN, manuscript in preparation; PDB code: 4WZJ) and the new model shows that whereas previously the G equivalent to G132 was also incorrectly placed in SmF (<a href=\"#bib27\">Leung et al., 2011</a>) the Sm site nucleotides bind in a similar manner in both minimal U1 and U4 core domain, except for SmD1. The fourth U of the U4 Sm site sequence is replaced by G in U1 snRNA in the majority of species including humans (<a href=\"http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/\">http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burge et al., 2012</a>). A large guanine base cannot be accommodated in SmD1 and hence it lies above His37 of SmB outside the central hole (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). In the Sm site sequence the phosphate groups of A126, U130 and U131 come close and are stabilized by a hydrated Mg<sup>++</sup> ion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The last two nucleotides of the nonamer, G132 and G133, fit into the binding pocket formed by SmD1-SmD2 and SmF-SmE, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

In the 3.3 \u00c5 structure almost the entire length of the U1-70k N-terminal peptide is well ordered and its interaction with the core domain is revealed in detail (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Residues 49\u201358, containing a type II proline helix (Pro55, Pro56 and Pro57), interact exclusively with SmD2 and its binding to SmD2 is stabilized by salt-bridges and hydrogen bonds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The U1-70k residues 39\u201349 are wedged in the crevice between SmD2 and SmF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Then the U1-70k peptide crosses the central hole where it interacts with the backbone and bases of stem IV (A135 to G138) of U1 snRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The 3\u2032 stem of U4 snRNA (stem II) blocks the path of the U1-70k peptide in the U4 core domain and hence the binding of this peptide is snRNA dependent (<a href=\"#bib27\">Leung et al., 2011</a>). The U1-70k residues 10\u201331 make extensive contacts as an extended peptide with SmD3 and the \u03b24 strand of SmB (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The residues 6\u201312 of U1-70k form a 3<sub>10</sub> helix and together with its N-terminal region contact the long helix B of U1-C to stabilize U1-C binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Apart from the interaction with U1-70k, U1-C interacts exclusively with SmD3. Helix A and \u03b21 of the Zn-finger and part of long Helix B of U1-C sit on the concave surface of SmD3 made by the N-terminal helix 1, \u03b22 strand and loop 2 and a short \u03b1-helix made by the C-terminal tail. The interface between U1-C and SmD3 is not tightly packed and is stabilized by salt-bridges and hydrogen bonds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The R21Q mutation in U1-C weakens its binding to U1 snRNP by about 10-fold (<a href=\"#bib34\">Muto et al., 2004</a>)."

It also has uridines at positions 5 and 6 instead of the pseudo-uridines found in natural U1 snRNA (<a href=\"#bib45\">Reddy et al., 1981</a>). Pseudo-uridines at these positions are conserved from yeast to human U1 snRNA (<a href=\"#bib31\">Massenet et al., 1999</a>). Only poorly diffracting crystals were obtained with pseudo-uridines at these positions. In the minimal U1 snRNP crystal, nucleotides 3 to 10 of U1 snRNA form Watson-Crick basepairs with the AG/GUAAGU sequence of the pre-mRNA strand (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a>) where / marks the splice junction. The minor groove of the RNA duplex between the 5\u2032SS and the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA interacts with U1-C on the surface made by Helix A and the \u03b21 strand. Several amino-acid side chains and main chain atoms of U1-C form hydrogen bonds with the 2\u2032OH groups and phosphate oxygen atoms of both strands of RNA near the splice junction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a>). However, U1-C makes no contacts with the RNA bases (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). At an early stage of spliceosomal assembly, U1 snRNP binds to the 5\u2032SS and U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) and splicing factor 1 (SF1) bind to the 3\u2032 splice site and branch point resulting in the formation of E complex. A double mutant (R28G, K29S) of U1-C fails to enhance the formation of E complex (<a href=\"#bib67\">Will et al., 1996</a>). The side-chains of Arg28 and Lys29 are located close to the phosphate backbone of U1 snRNA or 5\u2032SS RNA but their side chains have no density in our map. The 5\u2032-triphosphate of U1 snRNA is close to Glu32 and Asp36 of U1-C and their electrostatic repulsion may prevent stable interaction of the tri-methylguanosine cap with U1-C, thus allowing the pre-mRNA strand to gain access to bases of the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA to pair."

                                "text": "The first 215 residues of U1-70k are conserved well from yeast to human (48% sequence similarity), suggesting that this region has an evolutionarily conserved essential function, whereas the C-terminal region, predicted to be poorly structured, has diverged considerably. Some alternative splicing factors are known to bind to this region (<a href=\"#bib22\">Labourier et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ignjatovic et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cho et al., 2011</a>). The U1A70kF-RNA crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) reveals the interaction between stem-loop I and U1-70k in detail, illustrating a new mode of RRM-RNA interaction. The canonical RRM domain is known to bind with RNA through RNP1 and RNP2 motifs as first observed in the U1A- stem loop II complex structure (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oubridge et al., 1994</a>). The RRMs of U1-A and U1-70k have very similar structures (the \u03b2-strands and \u03b1-helices of the two RRMs superimpose with an rmsd of 0.70 \u00c5) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>) whereas the RNA loops bound to these RRMs have strikingly different structures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a>). The U1-A bound RNA loop has an open structure with ten nucleotide bases splayed out (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oubridge et al., 1994</a>). Bases of the first seven loop nucleotides show stacking interactions, either with adjacent bases or with protein side chains, while the last three nucleotides are poorly ordered. In contrast, the U1-70k bound RNA loop 1 with 11 loop nucleotides (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) is stabilized by base stacking interactions and basepairing of nucleotides within the loop and hence it is effectively a five-nucleotide loop (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). In U1-A the polypeptide loop between \u03b22 and \u03b23 (loop 3) protrudes through the RNA loop, stabilising it in an open conformation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) whereas loop 3 of U1-70k forms a \u03b2-turn and embraces C33 and G34 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The bases of C33 and G34 stack with each other and are sandwiched between the side chains of Arg191 and Lys138, which form salt-bridges with the phosphate groups of C33 and G34 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The second residue of RNP2 motif (Phe106) and the fifth residue of RNP1 motif (Phe148) show stacking interactions with the bases of C31 and A32 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) as commonly observed in the RRM-RNA complexes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oubridge et al., 1994</a>). The RNA loop is closed by a trans WC/Hoogsteen base pair formed between A29 and A36 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The base of G28, instead of forming a base pair with G37, flips out from the RNA helix and is sandwiched between the side chains of Arg172 and Tyr112, while the guanidinium group of Arg200 fills the gap (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The stacking interaction between G28 and Tyr112 accounts for the UV-crosslinking of these residues in U1 snRNP (<a href=\"#bib62\">Urlaub et al., 2000</a>). On the opposite strand the bases A35, A36, G37 and G38 continuously stack (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D</a>). U30 is packed against the side chain of Leu175 and forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp177 and the exocyclic amino group of the adjacent C31 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). The stacking interaction between U30 and Leu175 is consistent with the UV-crosslinking of these residues (<a href=\"#bib62\">Urlaub et al., 2000</a>)."

                                "text": "Within the 5\u2032SS of human genes processed by the major spliceosome, the most frequently observed nucleotides at each position of pre-mRNA from \u22123 to +6 form a Watson-Crick basepair with a nucleotide of the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The observed frequency tends to be higher in the middle and taper off towards both ends because mismatches affect the stability of the duplex less when they are further away from the middle. The first two intron nucleotides, which pair with C8 and A7 of U1 snRNA, are nearly invariantly GU (<a href=\"#bib3\">Burge et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sheth et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). The nucleotides at +3 and +4 pair with \u03a86 and \u03a85 of U1 snRNA, respectively, and A/G are found at +3 but A is found predominantly at +4. G is preferred at positions \u22121 and +5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), which pair with C9 and C4 of U1 snRNA, whilst U is preferred at +6. As the filter-binding assay described above requires large amounts of U1 snRNP, we studied binding of different 5\u2032SS sequences to U1 snRNP by competition assay using a short, fluorescently-labelled oligonucleotide as a reference (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). We found that a labelled consensus sequence oligonucleotide bound too tightly to be competed off by the weaker competitor oligonucleotides at concentrations that could be feasibly achieved in the experiment. Hence we used a mismatched labelled oligonucleotide (5SS-F). This does not influence the experiment's capacity to show whether one oligonucleotide competes better or worse than another. Single nucleotide substitutions at highly conserved positions substantially reduce the affinity of the 5\u2032SS oligonucleotide for U1 snRNP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). For example, substitution of G at \u22121, +1 and +5 with C drastically reduces the binding of the competitor oligonucleotide (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) as C does not form a stable basepair with C (<a href=\"#bib23\">Leontis et al., 2002</a>). Furthermore, substitution of +2U with an A severely reduces the binding affinity, presumably because an A\u2013A mismatch distorts and destabilizes the duplex itself (<a href=\"#bib23\">Leontis et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). The affinity of +2C 5\u2032SS RNA is higher than that of +2A (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) presumably because cytosine could form a wobble basepair with a protonated A (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gao and Patel, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wild et al., 2001</a>). This is consistent with the fact that C is found at +2 position, although very infrequently. G at +3 and +4 could form a wobble basepair with \u03a86 and \u03a85, respectively, and substitution of A with G at +3 or +4 position has only a moderate effect on the affinity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). The 5\u2032SS with a G \u2212 \u03a8 wobble basepair at +4 position (+4G) has higher affinity than the one at +3 position (+3G) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) whilst +3G occurs more frequently in human genes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) than +4G. <a href=\"#bib47\">Roca et al. (2012)</a> reported the effect of three single base substitutions in the 5\u2032SS on the melting temperature of the duplex between 5\u2032SS oligonucleotides and an oligonucleotide representing the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA. +1A and +2C both had severe effects on melting temperature, in agreement with our results. Most other mutations they studied introduced a bulged nucleotide. Here we did not include such 5\u2032SS oligonucleotides in our analysis, as it is hard to predict the effect of the bulged nucleotide on the molecular contacts observed in our crystal structure. We next studied binding of the same set of the 5\u2032SS oligonucleotides to U1 snRNP in the absence of U1-C (U1 snRNP[\u0394U1-C]) to see how U1-C contributes to the selection of 5\u2032SS oligonucleotides (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). To a first approximation these 5\u2032SS mutants show very similar affinities relative to the wild type both in the absence and presence of U1-C, enforcing the notion that 5\u2032SS are selected primarily by U1 snRNA. In the absence of U1-C, the mutant 5\u2032SS oligonucleotides with +3G or +4G compete well with the wild type as in the presence of U1-C but other oligonucleotides with +3U, +4U, +1C, \u22121C or +5C mutations compete better in the presence of U1-C than in its absence. This shows that U1-C fine-tunes the affinity of these mismatched oligonucleotides, in most sequences studied here, to provide extra stabilisation relative to the wild type. For example, in the presence of U1-C the oligonucleotides with +3U or +4U, which introduce U\u2013U mismatches, compete better with the wild type than they do in the absence of U1-C. Different types of U\u2013U basepair have been reported (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lietzke et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Leontis et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kiliszek et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sheng et al., 2013</a>). Our crystal structure showed that U1-C forms hydrogen bonds exclusively with sugar-phosphate backbone between \u22122 to +3 positions of pre-mRNA and at C9 and G11 of U1 snRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a>). When extra hydrogen bonding groups are provided by U1-C, the U\u2013U pair could easily switch from one type to another. It is conceivable that these amino acid residues of U1-C could provide extra stabilization for these non-canonical basepairs, possibly by altering helical geometry and/or minor groove width."

This conclusion is mainly based on a SELEX experiment, which may have been prone to an artefact caused by incomplete removal of the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA. We observed no binding of 5\u2032SS oligonucleotide by human U1-C protein, which was shown to be properly folded by NMR (<a href=\"#bib34\">Muto et al., 2004</a>). <a href=\"#bib53\">Schwer and Shuman (2014)</a> investigated the role of conserved basic and hydrophilic residues in yeast U1-C: they mutated residues that form hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms of either 5\u2032SS (Thr11, Thr14, Tyr12 and His24) or U1 snRNA (His15 and Ser19), form a salt-bridge with SmD3 (Arg21) or lie near the phosphate backbone (Lys22 and Arg28 [Lys28 in yeast]) in our crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Substitution of any one of these residues with Ala had no effect on yeast growth at any temperature indicating that these mutations do not have a major influence on 5\u2032SS selectivity, in agreement with our conclusion."

Our structure also revealed the molecular contacts between U1 snRNP and the 5\u2032SS of pre-mRNA and provided new insights into the molecular mechanism of 5\u2032SS selection. U1-C makes no contacts with nucleotide bases and U1 snRNP selects 5\u2032SS sequences primarily by thermodynamic stability of the RNA duplex between the 5\u2032-end of U1 snRNA and the 5\u2032SS.

Both structures contain a wealth of information regarding protein-protein interactions as well as protein-RNA interactions present in the RNP. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the paper is that the U1-C protein does not make base specific contacts with the 5' splice site. This finding dispels the currently accepted notion that U1-C participates in 5' splice site recognition. Overall, the manuscript is exceptionally clearly presented and the results are highly significant. Publication in <i>eLife</i> is recommended as is."

Furthermore, the structures establish a network of interactions within the U1 snRNP, particularly U1 snRNA, U1-C, U1-70k and the seven Sm proteins.
