Determining how neurons along a sensorimotor circuit contribute to this transformation is central to understanding behavior. To do this, a quantitative framework to describe behavioral dynamics is needed. In this study, we built a high-throughput optogenetic system for <i>Drosophila</i> larva to quantify the sensorimotor transformations underlying navigational behavior. We express CsChrimson, a red-shifted variant of channelrhodopsin, in specific chemosensory neurons and expose large numbers of freely moving animals to random optogenetic activation patterns. We quantify their behavioral responses and use reverse-correlation analysis to uncover the linear and static nonlinear components of navigation dynamics as functions of optogenetic activation patterns of specific sensory neurons. We find that linear\u2013nonlinear models accurately predict navigational decision-making for different optogenetic activation waveforms. We use our method to establish the valence and dynamics of navigation driven by optogenetic activation of different combinations of bitter-sensing gustatory neurons. Our method captures the dynamics of optogenetically induced behavior in compact, quantitative transformations that can be used to characterize circuits for sensorimotor processing and their contribution to navigational decision making."

Determining how neurons along a sensorimotor circuit contribute to this transformation is central to understanding behavior. To do this, a quantitative framework to describe behavioral dynamics is needed. In this study, we built a high-throughput optogenetic system for <i>Drosophila</i> larva to quantify the sensorimotor transformations underlying navigational behavior. We express CsChrimson, a red-shifted variant of channelrhodopsin, in specific chemosensory neurons and expose large numbers of freely moving animals to random optogenetic activation patterns. We quantify their behavioral responses and use reverse-correlation analysis to uncover the linear and static nonlinear components of navigation dynamics as functions of optogenetic activation patterns of specific sensory neurons. We find that linear\u2013nonlinear models accurately predict navigational decision-making for different optogenetic activation waveforms. We use our method to establish the valence and dynamics of navigation driven by optogenetic activation of different combinations of bitter-sensing gustatory neurons. Our method captures the dynamics of optogenetically induced behavior in compact, quantitative transformations that can be used to characterize circuits for sensorimotor processing and their contribution to navigational decision making."

The navigational strategies of insect larvae represent a long-standing paradigm for studying the mechanisms of animal orientation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Loeb, 1918</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Mast, 1938</a>). The small size and simple nervous system of the <i>Drosophila</i> larva, combined with its powerful genetic toolbox and recent advances in optical neurophysiology and anatomical reconstruction of circuit structure and connectivity, opens the possibility of understanding the neural encoding of animal navigation from sensory inputs to motor outputs without gaps (<a href=\"#bib28\">Saalfeld et al., 2012</a>). To accomplish this, a quantitative framework to describe navigation decision-making is needed. Such a framework can then be used to dissect the function of the neurons and circuits in charge of processing sensory information."

Attractive and repulsive responses can also be observed in the movement patterns of individual larvae (<a href=\"#bib22\">Louis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Luo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gershow et al., 2012</a>).

When the larva encounters improving conditions during each head sweep of a turn, it increases the likelihood of starting a new run, thereby starting more runs in favorable directions.

To do this, we engineered a high-throughput experimental setup capable of recording the run and turn movements of freely moving larvae subjected to defined optogenetic activation of selected chemosensory neurons. By measuring large numbers of animals responding to defined random patterns of optogenetic stimulation, we were able to collect enough data to use reverse-correlation analysis to connect optogenetic activation patterns of sensory neurons with motor patterns (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ringach and Shapley, 2004</a>).

When they encounter increasing chemoattractant concentrations during the head sweep of a turn, they increase the likelihood of starting a new run. The Or42a receptor is activated by a number of volatile chemoattractants including ethyl butyrate and ethyl acetate (<a href=\"#bib22\">Louis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kreher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Asahina et al., 2009</a>). Genetically modified animals in which the <i>Or42a</i>-expressing ORN is the only functional ORN are capable of climbing olfactory gradients towards these attractants. These observations strongly suggest that the <i>Or42a</i>-expressing ORN mediates attractant responses. To test our system, we subjected <i>Or42a&gt;CsChrimson</i> larvae to random optogenetic stimulation. We found that run-to-turn transitions coincided with a decrease in the probability of optogenetic activation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, left), whereas turn-to-run transitions coincided with an increase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, right). These patterns are consistent with an attractive response to Or42a activation. Importantly, the full shape of the event-triggered stimulus histories informs us about how the temporal optogenetic activation patterns of Or42a regulate each type of navigational movement. Methods that measure the tendency of larvae to aggregate near chemoattractants or net movement up chemoattractant gradients provide information about the overall tendency to navigate but not about the discrete decision-making processes that drive navigation."

We asked whether we could use our measurements of event-triggered stimulus histories to build such a model. A simple and widely used formalism is the LN model. In LN models, the linear filter component is proportional to our measurement of the event-triggered stimulus history (<a href=\"#bib12\">Geffen et al., 2009</a>). First, the stimulus waveform is passed through this linear filter to make an initial prediction of the behavioral response. Linear estimates have common problems, such as taking negative values and failing to account for saturation.

Then, we have a distribution for each point in the cyan and black curves shown; each of those distributions can be compared with the distribution before the light stimulus is presented. Since we have sufficient data such that np &gt;= 5 and n(1 \u2212 p) &gt;= 5 in all cases (n is the number of samples, and p is the probability of undergoing a transition), we conducted a z-test to compare the distribution at each time point after opotgenetic stimulation with the baseline distribution.

All the p-values lower than 0.05 are shown; we note that Gr21a larvae become significantly different than their baseline behavior 0.5 s before than Or45a larvae, in addition, Or45a larvae stay at values different from their baseline behavior for at least 0.75 s longer than Gr21a larvae. In the case of Or42a and Gr2a, we conducted the same analysis (<b>B</b> middle) and obtained that Gr2a behavior becomes significantly different than baseline at least 1.75 s before Or42a. However, in the case of Or42a, adaptation is only partial: Or42a larvae reach steady-state values of P(r \u2192 t) at different levels when red lights are ON or when red lights are OFF because of that we also computed the z-test between Or42a after lights are turn OFF as compared to the distribution at the steady-state condition with lights ON.

To explore this question, we compared the prediction and experimental measurement of stepwise activation of <i>Or45a</i>- and <i>Gr21a</i>-expressing neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Biphasic linear filters\u2014such as that associated with Gr21a and also seen in other sensory systems like the <i>Escherichia coli</i> chemotactic response\u2014contribute to adaptation following transient stimulation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Block et al., 1982</a>). A step increase in stimulation with repellants will cause a transient increase in the probability of run-to-turn transition. We predicted and confirmed differences in the adaptive return to baseline behavior for Gr21a and Or45a. The probability of run-to-turn transition returns to baseline faster in the case of Gr21a. Since each point represents a distribution of binary values (larvae transitioning from running to turning and larvae not transitioning), we used a z-test to identify regions where <i>P(r \u2192 t)</i> is significantly higher than baseline with p &lt; 0.05. We found that <i>P(r \u2192 t)</i> of Gr21a larvae reach values significantly higher than baseline at least 0.5 s earlier than Or45a larvae. In addition, Or45a larvae stay at elevated values of <i>P(r \u2192 t)</i> for at least 0.75 s longer than Gr21a larvae (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Gr2a is expressed in the A1 and A2 GRNs of the DO as well as in two unidentified neurons in the terminal organ (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kwon et al., 2011</a>). The role of the Gr2a receptor is not known, but it is part of the subfamily of Gr68a, which has been identified as a pheromone receptor in the adult fly (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bray and Amrein, 2003</a>). We calculated the event-triggered stimulus histories of <i>Gr2a&gt;CsChrimson</i> larvae and found that run-to-turn transitions coincided with a decrease in optogenetic activation, consistent with an attractant response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Interestingly, the linear filter associated with Gr2a was distinct from that of Or42a. In <i>Or42a&gt;CsChrimson</i>, the run-to-turn transition was preceded by a single negative lobe lasting \u223c2 s. In <i>Gr2a&gt;CsChrimson</i> larvae, the negative lobe was itself preceded by a positive lobe. As we did for repellants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), we asked whether the response dynamics to step decrease in optogenetic stimulation were distinct. We predicted and confirmed differences in behavioral dynamics. The most noticeable feature is that Or42a larvae reach different steady states of <i>P(r \u2192 t)</i> for lights ON or OFF; this creates differences in step-response dynamics. We conducted a z-test to identify regions where <i>P(r \u2192 t)</i> is significantly higher than baseline with p &lt; 0.05. Since the steady-state <i>P(r \u2192 t)</i> for Or42a larvae is different for lights ON and lights OFF, we conducted the z-test with both values (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Because Or42a larvae start at a lower <i>P(r \u2192 t)</i>, they take at least 1.75 s longer than Gr2a larvae for <i>P(r \u2192 t)</i> to become significantly higher than the lights OFF steady-state <i>P(r \u2192 t)</i>. Comparison with the steady-state <i>P(r \u2192 t)</i> for lights ON confirms that the steady-state <i>P(r \u2192 t)</i> for lights OFF is significantly higher with p &lt; 0.05 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Whereas most ORNs express a single Or, GRNs can express multiple Grs and each Gr can be expressed in multiple GRNs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kwon et al., 2011</a>). Thus, using larvae expressing CsChrimson under the control of different <i>Grx-</i>Gal4 drivers enabled us to assess the contribution of selected GRNs to behavior."

Most Grs are thought to respond to repulsive bitter compounds because they express the bitter markers Gr33a and Gr66a (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kwon et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that C1 is a broadly tuned mediator of repellant responses. Consistent with this hypothesis, optogenetic activation of C1 with random stimuli using <i>Gr9a&gt;CsChrimson</i> larvae evoked a weak repellant response where the run-to-turn transition coincided with a slight increase in the probability of optogenetic illumination (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) (this response was significantly different than the control with p &lt; 0.05, see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

This is surprising because the C2 neuron also expresses the bitter receptors Gr33a and Gr66a, which should drive repellant responses, although these receptors are also found in other neurons. One possibility is that the attractant response driven by C2 is inverted when additional gustatory neurons are recruited. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that co-activation of C1 and C2 using <i>Gr39a.a&gt;CsChrimson</i> larvae exhibited a much stronger repellant response than activation of C1 alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>).

We find that the LN model is capable of accounting for diverse dynamics across attractant and repellant responses in both the gustatory and olfactory systems. For example, LN models accurately predicted the differences in response speed and adaptation when different GRNs and ORNs were activated. One reason for the diversity of dynamics is that the <i>Drosophila</i> larva chemosensory system, in addition to encoding attractant and repellant responses, is also capable of shaping the dynamics of behavioral responses in ecologically important ways. For example, the priorities given to specific chemicals encountered in the environment might not only be measured in terms of their relative degrees of attraction or repulsion but also in the speed of the behavioral response that they trigger or the speed of adaptation. We note that some of the observed differences in behavioral dynamics might be caused by using different transgenic lines and different Gal4 drivers with different potencies. It would thus be useful to confirm the differences in behavioral dynamics that are suggested by our optogenetic manipulations with direct stimulation of each GRN and ORN and quantitative behavioral analysis in defined environments using cell-specific odorants and tastants."

Although little is known about the circuits downstream of the GRNs, our analysis of sensorimotor transformations serves as a reference to determine how these circuits organize navigational decision-making."

They identified 29 statistically different behavioral states, likely because they were able to interrogate circuits for a much wider variety of larval behaviors than navigation.

The linear transformations for <i>r \u2192 t</i> and <i>t \u2192 r</i> transitions were estimated by the event-triggered averages multiplied by the mean <i>t \u2192 r</i> or <i>r \u2192 t</i> rates, respectively (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sakai, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dayan and Abbott, 2001</a>). The convolution of the filters with the stimulus was computed numerically without fitting any function to the filter. The number of larvae used in the experiments of each figure can be found in the respective legends."

To activate CsChrimson, we use binary ON/OFF red light following a Bernoulli process (see below for rationale for using this process). We assign \u22121 to OFF state and +1 to ON state. During a run, the behavioral response can be characterized as the likelihood of initiating a turn (thereby ending the run). During a turn, the behavioral response is the likelihood of initiating a new run. Below, we describe our calculations for the run-to-turn transition.

Using Gaussian white noise, for example, would require intensity modulation of the optogenetic stimulus. While it is possible that induced spiking scales linearly with light intensity for some Gal4 drivers, a nonlinear relationship might also occur. By using a Bernoulli process, we can use a uniform light intensity for optogenetic stimulation and need only assume a consistent level of spiking with optogenetic stimulation. This assumption was validated by direct electrophysiological measurement in two ORNs (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). For a Bernoulli process, the random stimulation is confined to the timing of the ON or OFF state of the LEDs. Nonlinearities might still be introduced, for example, in delays in the onset or cessation of spiking with respect to the start or end of each illumination pulse. These effects pose an upper limit on the frequencies that can be used for random activation. To reduce the effect of these latencies while retaining the ability to characterize larval decision-making that occurs on the 1-s time scale, we used a stimulus frequency of 4 Hz. Because our method accurately predicts behavioral responses to trains of pulses of different widths as the one used in the right panel of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, the top right panel of <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, the right panel of <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, or the top right panel of <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, nonlinearities owing to spike latencies are not likely to have significantly affected the construction of our models."

These stimuli are random on-off (Bernoulli process that is wide-sense stationary and produces independent binary values). In an automated system, they monitor large numbers of larvae to a variety of receptor neuron activations and combinations thereof and apply Linear-Nonlinear (LN) models. Their results predict navigational responses for different optogenetic activation waveforms with reasonable accuracy. They also study the sensorimotor transformations underlying navigation driven by bitter sensing gustatory neurons. They find a diversity in the behavioral dynamics evoked by different subsets of gustatory neurons expressing different taste receptors, suggesting that larvae can discriminate between tastes of the same quality because these evoke kinetically different behavioral responses. These results have important implications for behavioral analysis of navigation in animals and serve as an entry point for further mechanistic studies in the important model system. Moreover, the application of the techniques here can be a model for applications in other systems."
