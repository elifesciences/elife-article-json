                    "text": "Toll-dependent patterning of the dorsoventral axis in <i>Drosophila</i> represents one of the best understood gene regulatory networks. However, its evolutionary origin has remained elusive. Outside the insects Toll is not known for a patterning function, but rather for a role in pathogen defense. Here, we show that in the milkweed bug <i>Oncopeltus fasciatus</i>, whose lineage split from <i>Drosophila's</i> more than 350 million years ago, Toll is only required to polarize a dynamic BMP signaling network. A theoretical model reveals that this network has self-regulatory properties and that shallow Toll signaling gradients are sufficient to initiate axis formation. Such gradients can account for the experimentally observed twinning of insect embryos upon egg fragmentation and might have evolved from a state of uniform Toll activity associated with protecting insect eggs against pathogens."

However, its evolutionary origin has remained elusive. Outside the insects Toll is not known for a patterning function, but rather for a role in pathogen defense. Here, we show that in the milkweed bug <i>Oncopeltus fasciatus</i>, whose lineage split from <i>Drosophila's</i> more than 350 million years ago, Toll is only required to polarize a dynamic BMP signaling network. A theoretical model reveals that this network has self-regulatory properties and that shallow Toll signaling gradients are sufficient to initiate axis formation. Such gradients can account for the experimentally observed twinning of insect embryos upon egg fragmentation and might have evolved from a state of uniform Toll activity associated with protecting insect eggs against pathogens."

Some of these molecules promote the activity of others; some have the opposite effect; and together these molecules and their interactions form \u2018signaling networks\u2019. One such network, which involves a protein called BMP, is needed to establish the belly-to-back axis of nearly all animals. However, insects are a unique exception. Most insects (including flies, beetles and wasps) use a different signaling network to control their development from their belly to their back, one that involves a protein called Toll instead. This is unexpected because, in other animals, Toll proteins are best known for their role in the immune system; and it remains unclear how Toll signaling came to be involved in insect development."

This caused the embryos to develop features all around their bodies that are normally only associated with the animal's underside. In other insects, the development of these so-called \u2018ventral\u2019 features is typically controlled by Toll signaling; but in the milkweed bug this activity instead depends on a protein called Sog. Indeed, when Sachs, Chen et al. experimentally reduced both BMP and Toll signaling, the effect was the same as having reduced only BMP signaling, implying that Toll is not needed. Instead, Toll increased the level of the Sog protein up to a particular threshold. Above this threshold, Sog and BMP control each other to set out the animal's body plan. As insects evolved, it seems likely that Toll transitioned from being a trigger of BMP signaling to an important controller of insect development in its own right. But why was Toll put in the egg in the first place? It is possible that Toll was required to protect the eggs of early insects from attack by bacteria and fungi. Future work will now test this assumption and aim to explain how and why the Toll protein changed its role\u2014from immunity to development\u2014during evolution."

While Toll's immune function is broadly conserved in animals ranging from hydra to humans, its role in axis formation appears to be an evolutionary novelty of insects (<a href=\"#bib28\">Leulier and Lemaitre, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Franzenburg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gilmore and Wolenski, 2012</a>). Other animals do not employ Toll but rather use BMP signaling to establish their DV axis (<a href=\"#bib8\">De Robertis, 2008</a>). BMP signaling also plays a crucial, but spatially restricted role in <i>Drosophila</i> DV patterning (<a href=\"#bib40\">O'Connor et al., 2006</a>). This suggests that Toll signaling was recruited into an ancestral BMP-based patterning network during evolution of the insect lineage."

However, already within the Holometabola, a clear evolutionary trend was observed: the more basally branching lineages show an increased reliance on BMP signaling while the importance of Toll signaling is reduced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, both the polarity and pattern of the DV axis depend on a stable long range gradient of Toll signaling that promotes the graded nuclear uptake of the NF-\u03baB transcription factor Dorsal (<a href=\"#bib48\">Reeves and Stathopoulos, 2009</a>). NF-\u03baB/Dorsal acts in a concentration-dependent manner to activate or repress genes required for DV cell fate specification (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The ventral cell fates of the mesoderm, mesectoderm and neuroectoderm directly depend on NF-\u03baB/Dorsal target genes. The dorsal cell fates (non-neurogenic ectoderm and extraembryonic amnioserosa) are determined in a more indirect way by Toll signaling restricting and polarizing an opposing BMP signaling gradient (<a href=\"#bib40\">O'Connor et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hong et al., 2008</a>). The gene regulatory network (GNR) controlled by NF-\u03baB/Dorsal has been extensively characterized. It encompasses 60\u201370 target genes which fall into six classes according to their enhancer structure (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hong et al., 2008</a>). The sensitivity of these enhancers to different NF-\u03baB/Dorsal concentrations is fine-tuned by ubiquitously distributed activators and repressors (<a href=\"#bib17\">Garcia and Stathopoulos, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ozdemir et al., 2014</a>)."

In the fly <i>Drosophila</i> Toll signaling not only determines the mesoderm, but also the neuroectoderm (yellow) and restricts BMP signaling to the dorsal side through several parallel mechanisms, including the activation of the BMP inhibitor <i>short gastrulation</i> (<i>sog</i>) (black arrow) and repression of the major BMP ligand <i>decapentaplegic</i> (<i>dpp</i>) (black T-bar) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hong et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Reeves and Stathopoulos, 2009</a>). On the dorsal side a BMP gradient (blue) is established (gray arrow and T-bar indicate BMP ligand production and inhibition, respectively) that specifies non-neurogenic ectoderm (blue) and extraembryonic tissue (green) (<a href=\"#bib40\">O'Connor et al., 2006</a>). Toll signaling is dynamic in <i>Tribolium</i> and polarizes BMP signaling only by activating sog (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2008</a>). BMP signaling in turn has an increased role in ectodermal patterning compared to flies (<a href=\"#bib65\">van der Zee et al., 2006</a>). In contrast to both <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Tribolium</i> Toll signaling in the wasp <i>Nasonia</i> appears to be restricted to a narrow ventral region where it is only transiently active. Here, Toll signaling is required to induce mesodermal and mesectodermal fates. But the size of the mesodermal region as well as the fate and position of all other regions along the DV axis are determined by a BMP signaling gradient emanating from the dorsal side by an unknown (Toll-independent) mechanism (black T-bar indicates repression of <i>twi</i>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">\u00d6z\u00fcak et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2014b</a>). Thus, in the holometabolous insects BMP signaling gets increasingly more important towards basally branching groups, while Toll's role is diminished, but remains essential for ventral-most cell fates. Here we provide evidence that the bug <i>Oncopeltus</i>, representing the Hemiptera within the sister group of Holometabola (Paraneoptera), uses Toll signaling only as spatial cue (dashed black arrow) to polarize a dynamic BMP signaling network that establishes a gradient responsible for patterning the cell fates along the DV axis. The key regulatory element of this network is the transcriptional repression of <i>sog</i> by BMP signaling. A reaction-diffusion model which incorporates this regulatory element shows that the formation of stable BMP gradients requires only weakly polarized Toll signaling (<a href=\"#box1\">Box 1</a>)."

The ventral-to-dorsal transport of Sog and Sog-BMP complexes and their dorsal cleavage by Tld leads to a BMP signaling gradient with peak levels at the dorsal side. Thus, Toll signaling via NF-\u03baB/Dorsal not only provides precise spatial information for the ventral half of the axis, but indirectly also determines the patterning of the dorsal half. An independent maternal input at the dorsal side of <i>Drosophila</i> embryos has been discussed, but it apparently plays only a minor role (<a href=\"#bib2\">Araujo and Bier, 2000</a>)."

These dynamics lead to a temporally shifting NF-\u03baB/Dorsal gradient which refines and disappears before the major DV patterning genes have established stable expression domains. This suggests that NF-\u03baB/Dorsal concentration thresholds play a less direct role in specifying these domains (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2000</a>). In addition, NF-\u03baB/Dorsal does not act as a repressor of BMP signaling components or as an activator of <i>brk</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2010</a>). Consequently, the establishment of the BMP gradient entirely relies on ventral (NF-\u03baB/Dorsal dependent) activation of <i>sog</i>. The BMP gradient in turn is required for all the polarity of the ectoderm (<a href=\"#bib65\">van der Zee et al., 2006</a>). Thus, in <i>Tribolium</i> the direct role of Toll signaling is largely restricted to mesoderm and mesectoderm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

However, the borders of the ventrally expressed genes are not defined by thresholds of Toll signaling, but rather by repressive BMP signaling. Thus, in <i>Nasonia</i> BMP signaling specifies gene expression domains along the entire DV axis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In this respect the DV system in <i>Nasonia</i> is similar to the ancestral type of DV axis formation in bilaterian animals. However, a closer look at the mechanisms of gradient formation reveals that the <i>Nasonia</i> system is highly derived even when compared to <i>Drosophila</i>. Functional studies show that the BMP gradient of <i>Nasonia</i> is established from a maternal source along the dorsal midline independent from ventral Toll signaling (<a href=\"#bib44\">\u00d6z\u00fcak et al., 2014b</a>). Indeed, the <i>Nasoni</i>a genome lacks a <i>sog</i> homolog and no ventrally expressed BMP inhibitor was identified (<a href=\"#bib43\">\u00d6z\u00fcak et al., 2014a</a>). The establishment of BMP signaling gradients by an opposing inhibitor gradient of Chordin/Sog is however, one of the most conserved aspects of DV axis formation in Bilateria and is even preserved in flies (<a href=\"#bib8\">De Robertis, 2008</a>). Moreover, given the fact that <i>Nasonia</i> also uses Toll for mesoderm/mesectoderm induction, it establishes its DV axis in a bipolar manner employing independent signaling sources along the ventral and dorsal midline of the egg. Bipolar DV axis formation has so far not been described in any other system."

(1) In more basal lineages BMP signaling is responsible for functions that are performed by Toll signaling in more derived lineages. (2) The ventral-most regions of the DV axis, giving rise to the mesoderm and mesectoderm, remain strictly dependent on Toll signaling. By studying a representative of insects with incomplete metamorphosis (Hemimetabola) we asked whether this situation is characteristic for all insects or whether a further reduction of the DV patterning function of Toll can be observed, allowing us to analyze how it originated."

We provide evidence that in <i>Oncopeltus</i> Toll is indeed no longer essential for mesoderm formation since repression of BMP signaling suffices to induce mesoderm. Like in other systems inhibition of BMP signaling is accomplished by <i>sog.</i> However, the transcriptional regulation of <i>sog</i> in <i>Oncopeltus</i> is more dynamic than in the other well-studied systems. It combines uniform Toll-independent activation with ventral enhancement by Toll and repression by BMP. We build a theoretical model based on the experimental findings and show that the BMP/sog pathway in <i>Oncopeltus</i> exhibits self-organized patterning (<a href=\"#box1\">Box 1</a>). Specifically, the interplay of BMP-dependent <i>sog</i> repression and Sog-dependent BMP transport generates a Turing instability (<a href=\"#bib63\">Turing, 1952</a>). Toll's role in this system seems to be reduced to providing a trigger that enhances Sog activity above a certain threshold to initiate the patterning process. However, this patterning mechanism differs from the well-studied activator-inhibitor models (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</a>); while <i>sog</i> is inhibited by BMP, there is no activator in our model."

In wt blastoderm embryos <i>msh</i> is expressed in a stripe with a sharp anterior border and a posterior border positioned at approximately 60% egg length (0% is the posterior pole). After <i>Toll1</i> and <i>dl1</i> KD the posterior <i>msh</i> border is shifted anteriorly, typically to 80% egg length, and the stripe expands towards the anterior tip of the embryo (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). This does not occur in dorsalized embryos after <i>tsg</i> KD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Using other markers, AP shifts have also not been seen in ventralized embryos after <i>dpp</i> and <i>tld</i> KD (see anterior <i>sim</i> stripe in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,R</a>). We therefore assume that Toll, unlike BMP signaling, is not only dedicated to DV patterning in <i>Oncopeltus</i>, but also contributes to specifying the AP axis. A role for Toll in positioning the embryo along the AP axis has recently been suggested for the hemipteran <i>Rhodnius</i> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berni et al., 2014</a>)."

To test this hypothesis, we produced embryos simultaneously lacking Toll and BMP signaling. To our surprise the <i>Toll1 dpp</i> double KD embryos showed uniform <i>twi</i> and <i>sog</i> expression along the embryonic circumference (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L,N</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the same as the <i>dpp</i> single KD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,G</a>). However, in contrast to the single KD of <i>dpp</i>, the double KD embryos also show an expansion and/or shift of the <i>sog</i>, <i>twi</i> and (anterior) <i>sim</i> domains towards the anterior pole (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013G</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L\u2013N</a>). This is likely due to the additional role of Toll signaling in anterior patterning and allows for an unambiguous distinction between double and single KD embryos (additional confirmation by RT-PCR, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our results suggest that DV patterning genes that require Toll signaling for expression in other insects can be activated in the absence of Toll signaling in <i>Oncopeltus</i>. As these genes are repressed by elevated BMP activity their state of expression seems to be mainly controlled by different levels of BMP signaling. This leads to the crucial question: What then is Toll's role within the DV patterning system of <i>Oncopeltus</i> if Toll is neither strictly required to activate ventral genes nor to prevent their repression?"

The transcriptional activation of <i>I-\u03baB</i> genes by Toll signaling appears to be an ancestral negative feedback loop essential for attenuating the innate immune response triggered by Toll (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hoffmann et al., 2002</a>). During <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Tribolium</i> DV patterning <i>cact</i> is an early target gene of Toll signaling expressed in regions of high nuclear NF-\u03baB/Dorsal concentrations (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sandmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2008</a>). The same appears to apply to <i>Nasonia</i> where <i>cact</i> expression is restricted to a narrow stripe straddling the ventral midline indicating a highly refined pattern of Toll activity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buchta et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">\u00d6z\u00fcak et al., 2014b</a>). The <i>Oncopeltus</i> genome harbors six <i>cact</i> paralogs, four of which are expressed during blastoderm stages (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vargas Jentzsch et al., 2015</a>) (and data not shown). While <i>cact1, 2</i> and <i>4</i> show only weakly asymmetric expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>, and data not shown), <i>cact3</i> is expressed in a broad ventral domain encompassing 60\u201380% of the embryonic circumference with graded borders toward the dorsal side (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013G,I,J</a>). The expression of <i>cact3</i> does not refine into a more narrow domain, but remains broad during later blastoderm stages. <i>Toll1</i> KD embryos lack (or show reduced) <i>cact1</i> and <i>cact3</i> expression, confirming the regulatory link known from other insects (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,H</a>). These observations support the notion that in <i>Oncopeltus</i>, Toll signaling is transiently active almost along the entire DV axis and forms a shallow gradient with lower levels in the dorsal half."

A shallow Toll signaling gradient breaks this symmetry by enhancing <i>sog</i> expression at the ventral side. This leads both to ventral suppression of BMP signaling, and to a flux of BMP-Sog complexes to the dorsal side. Subsequently, the Tld-dependent cleavage of Sog releases BMP and hence increases BMP signaling. Since BMP signaling represses <i>sog</i> expression, the asymmetry initiated by Toll is dynamically enhanced."

In the course of his experiments, Sander produced dorsal and ventral egg fragments during early development (preblastoderm) using a guillotine which completely separated the two egg halves. Complete germ band embryos developed within each half (<a href=\"#box1\">Box 1</a>). The model proposed here can reproduce such regulative behavior. A split along the DV axis prior to the initiation of patterning prevents diffusion from the ventral to the dorsal half. Thus, BMP acting as a long-range inhibitor of <i>sog</i> expression cannot travel from the ventral to the dorsal half to suppress <i>sog</i>. Since the NF-\u03baB/Dorsal gradient extends to the dorsal half, <i>sog</i> can be activated dorsally and initiates a second round of patterning. Consequently, <i>sog</i> domains and BMP gradients are produced independently in each half despite the NF-\u03baB/Dorsal gradient itself not having been altered (<a href=\"#box1\">Box 1</a>). The sizes of the <i>sog</i> and BMP domains are adjusted to the dimensions of the egg halves implying that the patterning process shows almost perfect scaling. Furthermore, the predicted orientation of the embryos with ventral sides pointing to the dorsal egg pole (after axis inversion through anatrepsis, [<a href=\"#bib45\">Panfilio, 2008</a>]) corresponds to the most frequently observed experimental outcome (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sander, 1971</a>). Thus, our model represents a minimal BMP/Sog (Chordin) system that exhibits self-organized DV patterning and explains a striking result from classical insect embryology. The only requirement for the NF-\u03baB/Dorsal gradient is that it extends into the dorsal half of the embryo. The expression of <i>cact</i> suggests that this condition is fulfilled in <i>Oncopeltus</i>. Unfortunately, the mechanical properties of <i>Oncopeltus</i> eggs prevents egg fragmentation to directly investigate the potential for twinning."

This is similar to other bilaterian animals but within insects has so far only been seen in the hymenopteran <i>Nasonia</i>, a representative of the most basally branching holometabolous insect order.

However, a binding site for transcription factors acting downstream of BMP signaling (Schnurri-Mad-Medea sites) has recently been identified within the proximal enhancer of <i>Drosophila sog</i> (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ozdemir et al., 2014</a>). Its functional significance is not known, but it might represent an evolutionary relict of the regulatory logic we have observed in <i>Oncopeltus</i> in which inhibitory BMP signaling is essential for defining the <i>sog</i> expression domain. A negative feedback of BMP on sog/chordin expression is familiar from many animal phyla. It has even been found in sea anemones, predating the emergence of the bilaterian body plan (<a href=\"#bib52\">Saina et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Genikhovich et al., 2015</a>).

This applies also to spiders, which however have evolved a special strategy of DV axis formation that is radically different from most other animal phyla. In spiders the migration of the BMP expressing cumulus cells towards a symmetric ring of <i>chordin</i> expression breaks DV symmetry (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyama-Oda and Oda, 2006</a>).

The BMP signaling peak in <i>Drosophila</i> forms within a domain of uniform <i>dpp</i> and <i>tld</i> expression and depends on both the diffusion of Sog-BMP complexes towards the dorsal side (from the ventral source region of <i>sog</i>) and on the degradation of Sog by Tld to release active BMP ligands dorsally.

The early dynamics of the system are restricted to reaction diffusion processes. In <i>Oncopeltus</i>, on the other hand, the transcriptional feedback of BMP signaling on <i>sog</i> expression creates a situation in which the size of the <i>sog</i> expression domain itself is an outcome of the system dynamics and becomes largely independent from NF-\u03baB/Dorsal."

Thus, ventral BMP signaling has to decrease below a certain threshold to enable normal DV pattern formation. This may provide the system with robustness against fluctuating BMP signaling levels. In our theoretical analysis, the homogeneous steady state of Sog and BMP undergoes a Turing instability when NF-\u03baB/Dorsal-dependent activation of <i>sog</i> reaches a threshold (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Then, rapid diffusion of BMP-Sog complexes and derepression of <i>sog</i> upon removal of BMP from the ventral side lead to the formation of a stripe with high expression of <i>sog</i>.

None of the columnar genes (<i>vnd</i>, <i>ind</i>, <i>msh</i>) show stripe-like expression in lateral regions of the blastoderm as in holometabolous insects (<a href=\"#bib67\">von Ohlen and Doe, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wheeler et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buchta et al., 2013</a>). We therefore expect that the early BMP gradient provides little patterning information on either the dorsal or ventral side, and that further refinement occurs progressively during and after gastrulation. This refinement also includes large-scale morphogenetic movements. For example, the narrow <i>twi</i> domain of germ band embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) results from massive convergent extension during anatrepsis (posterior invagination of the embryo and the amnion into the yolk [<a href=\"#bib45\">Panfilio, 2008</a>])."

Although we have not demonstrated the latter point experimentally, modeling shows that adding the repression of <i>sog</i> by BMP to the well known reaction diffusion system (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eldar et al., 2002</a>) leads to a decoupling of input (Toll signaling) and output (BMP signaling) patterns (<a href=\"#fig9 fig11\">Figures 9, 11</a>).

In all known holometabolous insects <i>cact</i> is activated by the NF-\u03baB/Dorsal gradient. This applies even to <i>Drosophila</i> as demonstrated with the help of an enhancer reporter construct which shows <i>twist</i>-like expression (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sandmann et al., 2007</a>). However, due to maternal loading of <i>cact,</i> its zygotic expression apparently has little functional relevance in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Roth et al., 1991</a>). In <i>Tribolium</i>, <i>cact</i> is only zygotically expressed and tightly follows the shifting gradient of NF-\u03baB/Dorsal (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2008</a>). Finally, in <i>Nasonia</i>, <i>cact</i> expression is restricted to a narrow stripe straddling the ventral midline where the expression of all other Toll signaling-dependent ventral genes is initiated (<a href=\"#bib44\">\u00d6z\u00fcak et al., 2014b</a>). Although the NF-\u03baB/Dorsal distribution is not known from <i>Nasonia</i>, a cluster of NF-\u03baB/Dorsal binding sites in the vicinity of the <i>cact</i> transcript suggests a direct regulatory input by Toll signaling. By analogy we assume that the broad, weakly graded expression of <i>cact</i> in <i>Oncopeltus</i> reflects a flat Toll signaling gradient which extends from the ventral to the dorsal half of the embryo (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

Preliminary data suggest that the asymmetry of Toll signaling originates from asymmetric eggshell cues that are established during oogenesis. By activating Toll signaling in a broad gradient, these eggshell cues would provide global polarity to the embryo, which is essential for establishing bilateral symmetry. Such a strong geometric influence does not exclude, but rather enables, certain forms of self-organized patterning. Classical insect embryology had described many instances of partial or complete twinning after experimental interference with patterning along the DV axis of the egg (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sander, 1976</a>). These experiments were not restricted to hemimetabolous insects, but included examples from beetles as well as butterflies."

Sander produced not only left and right, but also dorsal and ventral egg fragments and was able to recover apparently complete germ rudiments from all fragments. These findings could not previously be explained on the basis of the fairly deterministic mechanism of DV axis formation known from <i>Drosophila</i>. The mechanism we have discovered in <i>Oncopeltus</i> can, in principle, account for this type of axis duplication (<a href=\"#box1\">Box 1</a>). As long as Toll activity is globally provided so that <i>sog</i> can also be activated in the dorsal half of the egg, a new round of patterning can be initiated dorsally. A prerequisite for pattern re-initiation is a diffusion barrier, which prevents the transport of (inhibitory) BMP molecules from the ventral to the dorsal side. The guillotine-like mechanism with which Sander separated the egg fragments provided such a barrier."

Ancestrally, Toll signaling might have only provided a polarizing function for a self-organizing BMP system responsible for patterning the entire DV axis. Within certain lineages (e.g., flies, beetles and wasps) Toll signaling became more important in directly specifying cell fates along the axis, gradually replacing ancestral BMP functions."

Recent findings show that insect eggs are immune competent (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jacobs and van der Zee, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jacobs et al., 2014</a>). We suggest that this also applied to ancestral insects and that furnishing their eggs with a Toll-mediated pathogen defense system was crucial for early insects to adopt a terrestrial life style. The activation of Toll signaling by eggshell cues might have been fairly uniform throughout the embryo. Subsequently, only a mild polarization of Toll signaling together with weak transcriptional inputs on <i>sog</i> were sufficient to initiate the co-option of Toll signaling for DV patterning."

Since BMP represses Sog, this leads to a local increase in Sog production, causing the small \u2018seed\u2019 to grow. The steady-state consists of areas where BMP has been depleted (and where levels of Sog are high), bordering areas with high levels of BMP (and low levels of Sog).

This is in agreement with other recent theoretical models for BMP gradient formation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mizutani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shimmi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ben-Zvi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Umulis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Peluso et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Inomata et al., 2013</a>) and reflects the notion that additional ligands might contribute to increased robustness (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shimmi et al., 2005</a>), but have no essential impact on the mechanisms of pattern formation. The binding of the BMPs to their receptors is not part of our model although we are aware of receptor-mediated degradation affecting the mean free path of the ligand (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mizutani et al., 2005</a>). The model also neglects the binding of Tsg to Sog-BMP complexes and does not explicitly mention Tolloid (Tld), the enzyme that cleaves Sog. This can be justified by the fact that in blastoderm embryos <i>tsg</i> transcripts are not detectable (by ISH) suggesting very weak uniform expression and that <i>tld</i> is evenly expressed around the embryonic circumference (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The NF-\u03baB/Dorsal gradient in our model plays a similar role as the source density in the Gierer-Meinhardt model, which was used to explain regulative behavior in hydra (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</a>). In fact the mechanism of pattern formation bears some similarity with the local activation-lateral inhibition mechanism proposed by <a href=\"#bib19\">Gierer and Meinhardt (1972)</a>: BMP inhibits Sog production through transcriptional repression. However, this is the sole regulatory interaction in our model. Local self-activation arises from the fast transport of BMP within Sog-BMP complexes, which moves the repressor for <i>sog</i> from regions of high <i>sog</i> expression (increasing <i>sog</i> expression in those regions) to regions of low <i>sog</i> expression (decreasing <i>sog</i> expression there)."

As a result, small fluctuations in the NF-\u03baB/Dorsal concentration thus do not lead to the formation of a stripe. The size of this stripe does not change if the initial amount of NF-\u03baB/Dorsal is increased (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, right). This NF-\u03baB/Dorsal-induced instability of the homogeneous state is also behind the twinning phenomenon (<a href=\"#box1\">Box 1</a>): if the level of NF-\u03baB/Dorsal exceeds the critical threshold everywhere in the system, a stripe of Sog centered on the maximum of NF-\u03baB/Dorsal forms. Elsewhere, <i>sog</i> is repressed by BMP and transported away from the high-Sog stripe via the Sog-BMP complex. If the system is divided into two separate halves, this transport is interrupted, but the NF-\u03baB/Dorsal level is still above the critical threshold everywhere. Now there are two maxima of NF-\u03baB/Dorsal (one in each of the two halves), and a stripe of Sog forms at each of them."

We use the same parameters as in the one-dimensional case (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Starting from an initial distribution of NF-\u03baB/Dorsal along the ventral side of the cylinder, a stripe of Sog forms along the cylinder (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). All concentrations turn out to be independent of <i>y</i>. We find this also holds in the steady state if the initial distribution of NF-\u03baB/Dorsal varies in the <i>y-</i>direction. This becomes more apparent in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>, where the initial distribution of NF-\u03baB/Dorsal from <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> is shown in a contour plot, alongside the steady-state concentration of Sog. Thus, our model produces stripes of constant width (<i>sog</i> expression), which are centered on the ventral midline defined by NF-\u03baB/Dorsal. This is a remarkable feature as it had been difficult to produce striped patterns centered on the midline with local activation-lateral inhibition or substrate depletion mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib35\">Meinhardt, 2004</a>)."

With the universal role of BMP DV patterning in multicellular organisms, and the restricted role of the Toll pathway in DV patterning of Holometabolous insects like <i>Drosophila</i>, the question was what is the relation of the Toll and BMP pathways in DV patterning of <i>Oncopelus</i>. They show that BMP signaling is required to repress expression of early ventral and lateral genes (<i>twi</i> and <i>sog</i>) in the dorsal region. At early embryogenesis Sog displays a low and uniform expression. The role of Toll signaling is only to break this symmetry and lead to an increase (even a moderate one) in Sog levels at the ventral side. In a double RNAi mutant for Toll and <i>dpp</i>, ventral fates take over the entire embryo, indicating that in this species this is the default, and the role of Toll is only to repress BMP signaling in the ventral region by elevating the level of Sog. Because of the cross regulatory interactions between <i>dpp</i> and Sog, this leads to a stable BMP activation pattern and expression of the cardinal genes in restricted domains. Computational analysis indicates that this regulatory circuitry is robust to fluctuations, and requires only a minimal bias by the Toll pathway."

The ability to convert even a small bias (as in the middle panel of <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) to a bistable robust BMP pattern, clearly relies on transport of the Sog-BMP complex and its cleavage in the dorsal region by Tolloid. In this respect the logic of modulating BMP signaling is similar to what was described in <i>Drosophila</i>. It is not clear however whether this process is also responsible (as it is in <i>Drosophila</i>) for generating a graded pattern WITHIN the domain of BMP signaling. As far as I could tell, the pMad levels in embryos that are depleted for Sog were comparable to wt, suggesting that in the absence of inhibition by Sog, the levels of <i>dpp</i> are sufficient to elicit maximal signaling and no further concentration of the ligand is required. Also, the late patterns of pMad show sharp borders and fairly uniform expression within the dorsal region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>).

In brief: <i>Nasonia</i> represents a highly derived system as it is the only insect known so far which establishes the DV pattern in a bipolar manner. The BMP gradient appears to emerge from a maternal source along the dorsal midline independently from Toll and without transport through a ventrally expressed inhibitor. Sog is missing from the genome. In this respect <i>Nasonia\u2019s</i> DV patterning system is more derived than that of <i>Drosophila</i>. <i>Nasonia Toll</i> on the other hand remains responsible for ventral fates providing highly refined patterning information along the ventral midline. The <i>Toll dpp</i> double knockdown in <i>Nasonia</i> lacks mesoderm, in contrast to the double knockdown in <i>Oncopeltus</i>. Taken together while BMP is the dominant morphogen in <i>Nasonia</i> both the formation of the BMP gradient and the continued requirement of Toll signaling for the mesoderm/mesectoderm formation are in strong contrast to the DV patterning system of <i>Oncopeltus</i> that clearly represents an ancestral state with similarities to spiders and vertebrates."

It is not clear however whether this process is also responsible (as it is in</i> Drosophila<i>) for generating a graded pattern WITHIN the domain of BMP signaling.
