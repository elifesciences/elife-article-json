                    "text": "Coordinated gastrointestinal smooth muscle contraction is critical for proper nutrient absorption and is altered in a number of medical disorders. In this work, we demonstrate a critical role for the RGD-binding integrin \u03b18\u03b21 in promoting nutrient absorption through regulation of gastrointestinal motility. Smooth muscle-specific deletion and antibody blockade of \u03b18 in mice result in enhanced gastric antral smooth muscle contraction, more rapid gastric emptying, and more rapid transit of food through the small intestine leading to malabsorption of dietary fats and carbohydrates as well as protection from weight gain in a diet-induced model of obesity. Mechanistically, ligation of \u03b18\u03b21 by the milk protein Mfge8 reduces antral smooth muscle contractile force by preventing RhoA activation through a PTEN-dependent mechanism. Collectively, our results identify a role for \u03b18\u03b21 in regulating gastrointestinal motility and identify \u03b18 as a potential target for disorders characterized by hypo- or hyper-motility."

In this work, we demonstrate a critical role for the RGD-binding integrin \u03b18\u03b21 in promoting nutrient absorption through regulation of gastrointestinal motility. Smooth muscle-specific deletion and antibody blockade of \u03b18 in mice result in enhanced gastric antral smooth muscle contraction, more rapid gastric emptying, and more rapid transit of food through the small intestine leading to malabsorption of dietary fats and carbohydrates as well as protection from weight gain in a diet-induced model of obesity. Mechanistically, ligation of \u03b18\u03b21 by the milk protein Mfge8 reduces antral smooth muscle contractile force by preventing RhoA activation through a PTEN-dependent mechanism. Collectively, our results identify a role for \u03b18\u03b21 in regulating gastrointestinal motility and identify \u03b18 as a potential target for disorders characterized by hypo- or hyper-motility."

Mfge8 coordinates absorption of dietary fats by promoting enterocyte fatty acid uptake after ligation of the \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins (<a href=\"#bib23\">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</a>). Mfge8 also modulates smooth muscle contractile force (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kudo et al., 2013</a>). In mice deficient in Mfge8 (<i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></i>), airway and jejunal smooth muscle contraction are enhanced in response to contractile agonists after these muscle beds have been exposed to inflammatory cytokines but not under basal conditions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kudo et al., 2013</a>). Contraction of antral smooth muscle is a key determinant of the rate at which a solid food bolus exits the stomach and transits through the primary site of nutrient absorption, the small intestine (<a href=\"#bib15\">Haba and Sarna, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kelly, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Burks et al., 1985</a>).

The most definitive in vivo role described for \u03b18\u03b21 is in kidney morphogenesis where deletion of this integrin subunit leads to impaired recruitment of mesenchymal cells into epithelial structures (<a href=\"#bib32\">M\u00fcller et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Humbert et al., 2014</a>). Osteopontin, fibronectin, vitronectin, nephronectin, and tenascin-C have all previously been identified as ligands for \u03b18\u03b21 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schnapp et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Denda et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kiyozumi et al., 2012</a>). In this work we show that Mfge8 is a novel ligand for \u03b18\u03b21 and that Mfge8 ligation of \u03b18\u03b21 reduces the force of gastric antral smooth muscle contraction, the extent of gastric emptying, and the rate at which a food bolus transits through the small intestine. We further show that mice with smooth muscle-specific deletion of \u03b18 integrin subunit (<i>Itga8<sup>flox/flox</sup>\u2014Tg(Acta2-rtTA, TetO-Cre</i>) fail to properly absorb ingested fats and carbohydrates and are partially protected from weight gain in a model of diet-induced obesity. \u03b18\u03b21 slows gastrointestinal motility by increasing the activity of Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) leading to reduced activation of the Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA)."

Antral rings isolated from <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice had increased force of contraction in response to both methacholine (MCh) and KCl as compared with wild type (WT) controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>). The thickness of antral smooth muscle was not different when comparing Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup> and WT mice indicating that the enhanced contraction was not due to smooth muscle hypertrophy (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). Incubation with recombinant Mfge8 (rMfge8), but not a recombinant construct where the integrin-binding RGD sequence was mutated to RGE, rescued enhanced contraction indicating that the effect of Mfge8 on gastric smooth muscle was integrin-dependent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Induction of Mfge8 expression in the smooth muscle of <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup>\u2014Tg(Acta2-rtTA, TetO-Mfge8)</i> transgenic mice, abbreviated Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup>sm<sup>+</sup>, where Mfge8 expression was driven by a tetracycline-inducible Mfge8 transgene coupled with an \u03b1-smooth muscle-rtTA transgene (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) also rescued enhanced contraction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Of note, unlike antral rings, duodenal rings from <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice did not have enhanced contraction (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) consistent with our previously reported findings in jejunal smooth muscle rings (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kudo et al., 2013</a>). We next determined whether enhanced antrum contractility was associated with altered gastric emptying and small intestinal transit times (SIT), two in vivo measures of gastrointestinal motility. <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup> </i>mice had significantly more rapid gastric emptying and more rapid SIT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013G</a>). Administration of rMfge8 by gavage and transgenic smooth muscle expression of Mfge8 significantly reduced the rate of gastric emptying and prolonged SIT in <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013G</a>). Administration of rMfge8 by gavage also significantly reduced gastric emptying and prolonged SIT in WT mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and F</a>)."

We therefore investigated whether these integrins mediated the effect of Mfge8 on gastrointestinal motility. Antrum contraction was similar in WT, <i>Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup>, Itgb5<sup>-/-</sup></i>and <i>Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup>::Itgb5</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Gastric emptying and SIT were also similar in <i>Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup>, Itgb5<sup>-/-</sup></i>and <i>Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup>::Itgb<sup>-/-</sup> </i>mice and rMfge8 significantly reduced the rate of gastric emptying and prolonged SIT in each mouse line (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). These data indicate that the effect of Mfge8 on smooth muscle contraction occurs via a novel RGD-binding, integrin partner."

                                "text": "We have previously shown that Mfge8 does not bind the RGD-binding integrins \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28, and \u03b15\u03b21\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Atabai et al., 2009</a>), leaving \u03b18\u03b21 and \u03b1v\u03b21 as the potential RGD-binding receptors for the effect of Mfge8 on smooth muscle contraction. We initially focused on \u03b18\u03b21 because of its high expression in smooth muscle (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schnapp et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kitchen et al., 2013</a>). To determine if \u03b18\u03b21 is a receptor for Mfge8, we used a solid-phase assay to analyze the direct binding of Mfge8 to purified \u03b18. We included purified \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b15\u03b21 as positive and negative controls, respectively. Mfge8 bound to \u03b18\u03b21 and \u03b1v\u03b23, but not to \u03b15\u03b21 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To further confirm this interaction, we evaluated cell adhesion of SW480 cells, a human colon cancer cell line, transfected with \u03b18 or \u03b23 to Mfge8 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Control SW480 cells express the Mfge8 ligand \u03b1v\u03b25 as well as \u03b15\u03b21 and bind Mfge8 in an \u03b1v\u03b25-dependent manner. Mock-transfected control SW480 cells adhered to Mfge8 and adherence was blocked by anti-\u03b25 antibody (ALULA). In the presence of ALULA, \u03b23-transfected cells adhered to Mfge8 (\u03b1v\u03b23 is a known receptor for Mfge8, as above), and adherence was blocked by an anti-\u03b23 antibody (LM609). \u03b18-transfected SW480 cells also adhered to Mfge8 in the presence of ALULA, and adherence was blocked by the addition of an \u03b18 blocking antibody (YZ3) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nishimichi et al., 2015</a>). The YZ3 antibody blocks both human and mouse \u03b18. These results indicate that \u03b18\u03b21 specifically mediates cell adhesion to Mfge8. Next we analyzed adhesion of \u03b18-transfected SW480 cells to Mfge8 at various concentrations in the presence of ALULA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The \u03b18-transfected cells adhered to Mfge8 in a dose-dependent fashion. Of note, expression of \u03b25, \u03b23, and \u03b18, as evaluated by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and the extent of binding to Mfge8 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>) were similar in these cell lines."

Antral rings from <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></i> and \u03b18sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice had exaggerated contraction to both MCh and KCl suggesting altered calcium sensitivity as the mechanism by which Mfge8 reduced contraction since these agonists increase intracellular calcium through different mechanisms. KCl works primarily by inducing opening of voltage-gated calcium channels leading to influx of extracellular calcium while MCh induces release of intracellular calcium stores after receptor binding. To determine whether enhanced antral contraction was due to an increase in smooth muscle calcium sensitivity, we assessed the phosphorylation status of the regulatory subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase, MYPT, and myosin light chain (MLC) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kudo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kudo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Somlyo and Somlyo, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Somlyo and Somlyo, 2003</a>).

In vascular smooth muscle, \u03b18 has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with RhoA and siRNA knockdown of \u03b18\u00a0leads to less membrane localization and thereby less active RhoA (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zargham et al., 2007</a>). shRNA-mediated knockdown of \u03b18 in intestinal epithelial cells has also been reported to lead to reduction in active RhoA (<a href=\"#bib5\">Benoit et al., 2009</a>). In contrast to these findings (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zargham et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Benoit et al., 2009</a>), we found that in gastric smooth muscle, Mfge8 ligation of \u03b18\u03b21 prevents RhoA activation and that this effect is mediated by opposing the activity of PI3K. It is unclear to us why \u03b18\u03b21\u00a0has opposing effects on RhoA activation in different cell types. RhoA becomes activated by GTP loading and reverts to an inactive state when GDP-bound. The activation status of RhoA is regulated by a large family of RhoA GTPase Activating Factors (RhoGAPs) and RhoA GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) which convert GTP to GDP or load or RhoA would GTP respectively (<a href=\"#bib35\">Puetz et al., 2009</a>). We speculate that the most likely explanation for \u03b18\u03b21 preventing RhoA activation in gastric smooth muscle while presumably favoring RhoA activation in vascular smooth muscle and intestinal epithelial cells is differential effects of the \u03b18\u03b21 on\u00a0and/or differential expression of RhoGAPs and RhoGEFs in specific cell types. These data suggest that the role for the \u03b18\u03b21 integrin in regulation of RhoA and contractility can vary depending on the context within which the integrin is activated. Support for an \u03b18\u03b21-PI3K-RhoA axis regulating motility is evidenced by the ability of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin to abrogate the exaggerated antral contraction in <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup> </i>and \u03b18sm<sup>-/-</sup> antral rings coupled with the increase in AKT phosphorylation and RhoA activation in <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup> </i>and \u03b18sm<sup>-/-</sup> antral rings. We also found that PI3K inhibition after Mfge8 ligation of \u03b18\u03b21 occurs through an increase in the activity of the phosphatase PTEN which directly opposes PI3K by converting PIP3 to PIP2. Furthermore, PTEN activity in antral samples had an inverse correlation with the extent of gastric emptying and rate of SIT suggesting an essential role for PTEN in regulating gastrointestinal motility."

Mfge8 slows gastrointestinal motility thereby increasing the time for absorption of dietary fats and directly induces enterocyte fatty acid uptake (<a href=\"#bib23\">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</a>). Since Mfge8 is a secreted molecule, we cannot rule out an effect on antral contraction secondary to Mfge8 binding of integrin receptors on local neurons in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the fact that \u03b18sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice phenocopy the motility phenotype of <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice strongly suggests that the dominant effect of Mfge8 on antral contractility is mediated through ligation of integrin receptors on smooth muscle. The relative contribution of altered motility versus impaired fatty acid uptake to the malabsorption phenotype in <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice is difficult to parse out from our data. After 12 weeks on a HFD, <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></i> gained approximately 50% less weight than WT controls (<a href=\"#bib23\">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</a>) while \u03b18sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice gained approximately 40% less weight than WT controls. One interpretation of this data is that the dominant mechanism underlying protection from weight gain in <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice on a HFD is accelerated motility. However the elevated stool TG content in <i>Itgb3</i><sup>-/-</sup><i>::Itgb5</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice suggests a critical contribution of lipid absorption to steatorrhea since these mice have impaired enterocyte fatty acid uptake but normal motility. Another possibility is that ligands in addition to Mfge8 can bind \u03b1<sub>8</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> leading to inhibition of gastrointestinal motility and resulting in a relatively greater malabsorption phenotype secondary to altered motility in \u03b18sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice than in <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. Of note, a recent publication looking at global \u03b18 null mice and global \u03b18 null mice in the ApoE background assessed body weights in each of these mouse lines (<a href=\"#bib31\">Menendez-Castro et al., 2015</a>). Consistent with our findings in \u03b18sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice on a control diet, global \u03b18 null mice and global \u03b18 null mice in the ApoE background had reduced body weight as compared with control mice. In global \u03b18 null mice, there was no statistically significant difference in body weights (by our calculation a P value of 0.059), but it is important to note that these mice do not appear to have reached the age at which we saw significant differences in body weights in \u03b18sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib31\">Menendez-Castro et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, though no statistical significance was reported in the comparison of body weights of the global \u03b18 null mice in the ApoE background at 1 year of age, a 2-tailed t-test of the presented data comparing mice homozygous for the \u03b18 null mutation with wild type mice (both in the ApoE no background) produced a P value of 0.016 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Menendez-Castro et al., 2015</a>)."

Mfge8 slows gastrointestinal motility by increasing PTEN activity leading to inhibition of PI3K activity while Mfge8 increases fatty acid uptake by activating PI3K (<a href=\"#bib23\">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</a>). The effect on fatty acid uptake and PI3K activation is mediated through the \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins (<a href=\"#bib23\">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</a>) while the effect on gastrointestinal motility and PI3K inhibition is mediated through the \u03b18\u03b21integrin. Of note, both the \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins are expressed on gastric smooth muscle. However, even though Mfge8 is a ligand for both of these integrins, single and double knockouts of \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 did not have the gastric smooth muscle phenotype of Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that even if Mfge8 binds these integrins on smooth muscle cells, binding does not lead to alterations in calcium sensitivity and smooth muscle contractility. Furthermore, in relation to modulation of PI3K activity, our data suggest that in smooth muscle cells the effect of Mfge8 ligation of \u03b18\u03b21is dominant over any effect that Mfge8 ligation of \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 may havesince baseline phosphorylated AKT levels (reflecting PI3K activation) are increased in antral tissue from <i>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice as compared with WT controls. Furthermore, rMfge8 treatment reduces AKT phosphorylation in antral rings while it increases AKT phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</a>). Finally, we have ruled out the possibility that Mfge8 is a ligand for any other RGD-binding integrin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atabai et al., 2009</a>) other than \u03b1v\u03b21 and non-integrin receptors that have not been identified for Mfge8."

One possibility is that it is absorbed into the bloodstream and takes a hematogenous route to the smooth muscle. In our previously published work, oral Mfge8 gavage did not lead to discernible serum Mfge8 levels 30 min after gavage (<a href=\"#bib23\">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</a>). While this would argue against a hematogenous route to the smooth muscle, it is possible that blood levels are below the sensitivity of the Mfge8 ELISA. Alternatively, measurement of serum levels at earlier time points may show recombinant protein in the bloodstream. Another possibility is that the epithelium takes up the recombinant Mfge8 and secretes it from the basal side and that Mfge8 reaches the smooth muscle either directly or through entering the circulation on the basal side."

We used a one-way ANOVA to make comparisons between multiple groups. When the ANOVA comparison was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05), we performed further pairwise analysis using a Bonferroni t-test. We used a two-sided Student's t-test for comparisons between 2 groups. For analysis of weight gain over time in mice, we used a two-way ANOVA for repeated measures. We used GraphPad Prism 6.0 for all statistical analyses. We presented all data as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. We selected sample size for animal experiments based on numbers typically used in the literature. We did not perform randomization of animals."

Therefore our first investigations were focused on understanding whether these integrins mediated the effect of Mfge8 on smooth muscle contraction. As presented in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014 figure supplement 1</a>, we did an extensive in vivo evaluation of both single and double knockouts of each of these integrins and found that the knockouts did not phenocopy the Mfge8 knockout. Of the remaining RGD binding integrins, we have previously published that Mfge8 does not bind \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28 or \u03b15\u03b21 (Atabai et al., J Clin Invest 2009) and therefore focused on \u03b18\u03b21 given its extensive smooth muscle expression. While it is possible (and likely) that Mfge8 binds \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 on smooth muscle, our data supports the conclusion that the effect on smooth muscle calcium sensitivity and contraction is mediated through ligation of 1. It is interesting to note that while we show in this work that Mfge8 ligation of \u03b18\u03b21 leads to inhibition of PI3 kinase activity, we have previously shown that Mfge8 binding of the \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 increases PI3 kinase activity in enterocytes (Khalifeh-Soltani et al., Nat Med 2014). Therefore one possibility is that the effect of \u03b18\u03b21 in smooth muscle on PI3 kinase activity dominates any effect seen through ligation of \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. Alternatively, there may be different adapter proteins at play in enterocytes than in smooth muscle cells that dictate how integrin ligation modulates PI3 kinase activity. We have expanded our discussion of this point in the Discussion section of the manuscript (second paragraph)."

However, since mice with smooth muscle-specific deletion of the \u03b18 integrin phenocopy the antral contraction phenotype observed in global Mfge8 knockouts, we can be confident that the dominant effect of Mfge8 on gastric smooth muscle contraction is due to ligation of the \u03b18 integrin on smooth muscle.

We found positive staining of exogenously administered recombinant Mfge8 throughout the antral smooth muscle. We speculate that Mfge8 is reaching the smooth muscle either through the bloodstream or by being taken up by the epithelial layer and subsequently being secreted from the basal surface towards the smooth muscle or entering the bloodstream from the basal side. In our previous publication using the same dose of oral Mfge8 (as used in this manuscript) to increase fat absorption, we were unable to measure detectable serum Mfge8 levels by ELISA 30 minutes after gavage<sup>2</sup>. These data would suggest that either oral Mfge8 does not get into the bloodstream or, if it does, it is below the detection level of the currently available ELISA.

The standard TLC assay also measures conversion of PIP3 to PIP2 and therefore provides no additional information beyond the assay that we used. Furthermore, many of the older assays measure the release of phosphate and therefore are less specific than the assay which we used. We agree that in theory the PIP2 produced in the lysate could be the result of another phosphatase in the tissue. However, PTEN is the main known phosphatase that mediates this reaction. In addition, the fact that siRNA knockdown of PTEN lead to enhanced calcium sensitivity and RhoA activation that was not rescued by the addition of recombinant Mfge8 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G, H</a>) gives us further confidence that PTEN is the key phosphatase modulating this pathway."

In the paper by Menendez-Castro (Menendez-Castro et al., J Pathol 2013), the authors evaluated global \u03b18 knockout mice as well as \u03b18 knockout mice in the ApoE null background. As best as we can tell from the Methods section, the weights reported in table 1 for the global \u03b18 knockouts are from mice that are likely between 10-16 weeks of age. We are making this estimation based on the fact that the authors state that male mice of 18 g in weight were studied and we presume this is in the c57bl/6 background (though this is not specifically stated). Our mice of that strain and sex and weight are typically 6-8 weeks of age. Then, the mice were sacrificed either 4 or 8 weeks after carotid artery ligation, but it is not clear to us which of these time points are presented in table 1. It does seem safe to conclude that the mice at their oldest would have been 16 weeks of age. Though there are no statistically significant differences in weights reported in table 1, there does appear to be a trend towards reduced weight in the \u03b18 global knockout with the homozygotes weighing less than the heterozygotes which weigh less than the wild types. Furthermore, when we perform a 2-tailed t-test on the presented data in table 1 comparing the wild type with the global \u03b18 knockout, we get a P value of 0.059. In our dataset, we only observe a statistically significant difference in body weight in male mice that are 21 weeks of age on a normal chow diet and the difference is quite modest. Therefore, we believe that our data is consistent with the published data. In table 2 of the paper by Menendez-Castro, the authors show that the weights of \u03b18 KOs in the ApoE null background are no different than wild type. However,, there does appear to be a difference in weights with the ApoE null in the wild type background weighing 34.34 g with a standard deviation of 0.8 and the global \u03b18 KOs in the ApoE null background weighing 31.54 g with a standard deviation of 0.65. Of note, these mice were studied at one year of age and the latter group developed evidence for renal disease. Whether renal disease led to retention of fluid thereby influencing body weights was not experimentally addressed and body composition was not reported. Therefore, it is somewhat difficult to compare the results of these body weights with the smooth muscle specific knockouts, we studied. That being said, we believe that the trend towards reduced body weight in the \u03b18 KO in the ApoE null background is consistent with our findings and appeared to be quite close to reaching statistical significance based on the reported standard deviation. In fact, when we perform a 2-tailed t-test comparing ApoE null in the wild type background with the \u03b18 KO in the ApoE null background using the reported body weights, sample size, and standard error of the mean we get a P value of 0.016 indicating that in fact there is statistical significance between body weights."
