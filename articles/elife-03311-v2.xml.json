To elucidate such function(s), we generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional epsin triple KO mice. Triple KO cells displayed a dramatic cell division defect. Additionally, a robust impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis was observed, with an accumulation of early and U-shaped pits. This defect correlated with a perturbation of the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton, which we confirmed in a cell-free assay of endocytosis. Our results indicate that a key evolutionary conserved function of epsin, in addition to other roles that include, as we show here, a low affinity interaction with SNAREs, is to help generate the force that leads to invagination and then fission of clathrin-coated pits."

To elucidate such function(s), we generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional epsin triple KO mice. Triple KO cells displayed a dramatic cell division defect. Additionally, a robust impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis was observed, with an accumulation of early and U-shaped pits. This defect correlated with a perturbation of the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton, which we confirmed in a cell-free assay of endocytosis. Our results indicate that a key evolutionary conserved function of epsin, in addition to other roles that include, as we show here, a low affinity interaction with SNAREs, is to help generate the force that leads to invagination and then fission of clathrin-coated pits."

First, the cargo interacts with adaptor proteins that help cluster them in the cell's outer membrane, called the plasma membrane. This causes the protein clathrin to assemble into a lattice at the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane and deform the membrane into a pit. The pit grows deeper over time as more clathrin molecules assemble, eventually resulting in a deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pit that encloses the cargo to be taken up by the cell. The clathrin-coated pit then pinches off inside the cell in a process called fission to form a bubble-like structure called a vesicle, which transports the molecule to its destination."

Many other factors are also involved. One of them is epsin, the collective name for a family of three very similar proteins in mammalian cells. Epsin binds to several other proteins implicated in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, including clathrin itself, and to plasma membrane proteins specifically \u2018tagged\u2019 for internalization. In addition, a portion of the epsin molecule can insert into the plasma membrane and help it to curve, which is important for forming the invaginated pit. However, due to the number of possible functions epsin could perform, its main role has remained elusive."

The normal linking of the actin filaments to the clathrin coat does not occur, and another protein called Hip1R that also participates in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and links clathrin to actin, no longer accumulates at the clathrin-coated pits. Messa et al. also find that epsins can bind directly to actin. Overall, these results suggest that a main role of epsin is to help actin interact with the clathrin-coated pits and generate the force required for a pit to develop into a vesicle. However, epsin also performs many other roles, including recruiting a membrane protein (a so-called SNARE) that directs the fate of the vesicle to the clathrin-coated pit."

These factors help coordinate nucleation of the clathrin coat with cargo selection, membrane invagination and fission (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schmid, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Slepnev and De Camilli, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kaksonen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Merrifield et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012</a>). An important player in these processes is epsin, the collective name for a family of evolutionarily conserved clathrin-associated proteins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wendland, 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ford et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chen and De Camilli, 2005</a>), which in mammals is represented by three isoforms: epsin 1, 2, and 3 (encoded by the <i>Epn1</i>, <i>Epn2</i>, and <i>Epn3</i> genes, respectively [<a href=\"#bib35\">Ko et al., 2010</a>]). Epsin was identified as a major interactor of Eps15 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 1998</a>), another clathrin coat associated protein. It comprises a membrane binding N-terminal ENTH (Epsin N-Terminal Homology) domain, which is followed by ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs [<a href=\"#bib48\">Polo et al., 2002</a>]) and a long sequence (tail) predicted to be primarily unfolded and flexible (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wendland, 2002</a>). The core of the ENTH domain is preceded by a short sequence that is unfolded in solution but folds into an amphipathic \u03b1-helix upon binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. The hydrophobic portion of the helix partially penetrates the bilayer, thus conferring membrane curvature generation and sensing properties to the protein (<a href=\"#bib30\">Itoh et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ford et al., 2002</a>). Epsin's disordered tail binds components of the clathrin coat via multiple short amino acid motifs: \u2018clathrin boxes\u2019 bind clathrin, DPW/F motifs bind the appendage domain of AP-2, and NPF motifs bind the EH domains of Eps15 and intersectin (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rosenthal et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Drake, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Shih et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Overstreet et al., 2003</a>)."

Strong evidence for such a role came from the demonstration of Notch signaling defects in epsin (<i>liquid facets</i>) mutant flies, as Notch signaling is critically dependent upon ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis of Notch ligands (<a href=\"#bib46\">Overstreet et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Xie et al., 2012</a>). However, other findings pointed to a general housekeeping role of epsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

In both these unicellular organisms, epsin functions in close cooperation with Sla2/Hip1R, another evolutionarily conserved clathrin accessory factor (<a href=\"#bib9a\">Brady et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Skruzny et al., 2012</a>).

Accordingly, Sla2/Hip1R binds actin and is thought to function as a major link between the clathrin coat and actin. Studies in yeast have additionally shown that the ENTH domain of epsin and the ANTH domain of Sla2 interact with each other, and the two proteins function together in providing a link between the endocytic coat and the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib58\">Skruzny et al., 2012</a>)."

Moreover, studies of epsin 1 and 2 conditional double KO endothelial cells revealed a selective defect in the internalization of ubiquitinated VEGF receptor (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pasula et al., 2012</a>).

Our results, which capitalize on triple KO (TKO) cells generated from conditional epsin TKO mice, show that epsin provides a link between the clathrin coat and actin and is needed for the transition of pits from a shallow to a deeply invaginated state. As in unicellular organisms, epsin acts in concert with Hip1R but with differences from yeast to mammals. An additional function of epsin is a low affinity interaction of its ENTH domain with synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 (Syb2) that may help ensure the presence of a vesicular SNARE in the budding vesicle."

Following preincubation with Alexa594-transferrin on ice and subsequent incubation at 37\u00b0C for 15 min, the bulk of transferrin remained at the cell surface in TKO cells, while remaining transferrin was intracellular in control cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>). This change correlated with a major shift of overexpressed and endogenous transferrin receptor from a punctate localization in the cytoplasm (WT cells) to a plasma membrane localization (TKO cells), as demonstrated by both immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,K</a>) and a cell surface biotinylation assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>). Transferrin internalization impairment could be rescued by electroporation of epsin1-GFP cDNA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). Likewise, a major shift of the localization of synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 (Syb2), a vesicular SNARE that is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, was observed in TKO MEFs stably expressing Syb2-HA, (this construct harbors the HA epitope at the very short C-terminal non-cytosolic portion of Syb2). Total Syb2 immunoreactivity had a predominant punctate intracellular distribution in control MEFs, and an additional strong plasma membrane localization in TKO (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2M,O</a>). The presence of an abundant surface exposed pool of Syb2 selectively in TKO MEFs was confirmed by the surface immunofluorescence for the HA epitope (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2N,P</a>) and by a cell surface biotinylation assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Q,R</a>)."

Such a phenotype was interpreted as a defect in the fission reaction.

However, important differences relative to incubations with control cytosol were observed. In membrane sheets incubated with control brain cytosol, F-actin polymerized in alignment with the invaginations thus generating a well-organized scaffold that contributes to maintain their parallel orientation perpendicular to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, left panels). On the contrary, in membranes incubated with TKO cytosol, the F-actin network around the invaginations was exaggerated and disorganized (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, right panels), leading to clumping of the tips of the invaginations in a meshwork of actin. As a result of this clumping, invaginations often had an oblique orientation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>, right panels and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Such disorganization was confirmed by electron microscopic observations of sections cut parallel to the substrate.

It was therefore of interest to determine whether epsin, like several clathrin adaptors with ENTH/ANTH domains (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hirst et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Miller et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Koo et al., 2011</a>), binds SNAREs. SNARE binding by ENTH/ANTH family proteins helps coordinate bud formation with the incorporation of an appropriate SNARE in the nascent vesicle to direct its fate after fission. Such binding in the case of epsin would likely be of very low affinity, as it was not detected in previous investigations. However, even a low affinity binding could be of physiological significance in the context of other synergistic interaction between epsin, the membrane bilayer and other coat proteins."

A direct interaction was next explored by assessing binding to the ENTH domain of epsin 1 (with an His tag at the C-terminus) to increasing concentrations of the cytosolic portion of Syb2 fused to GST (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The very low affinity of this interaction (K<sub>D</sub> 470 \u00b1 30 \u03bcM) was enhanced by the presence in the incubation medium of IP<sub>6</sub> (K<sub>D</sub> 80 \u00b1 7.9 \u03bcM, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), which induces the folding of helix zero of the ENTH domain (<a href=\"#bib30\">Itoh et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ford et al., 2002</a>). In contrast, the deletion of helix zero from the ENTH construct abolished Syb2 binding in either the presence or the absence of IP<sub>6</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Further analysis of the interaction of Syb2 with the ENTH domain using Syb2 fragments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) identified the SNARE motif of Syb2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,G</a>), and more specifically the N-terminal portion of the motif (residues 29\u201360, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H,I</a>), as the region responsible for binding.

Elucidation of epsin function in mammalian cells had been complicated by the existence of the three <i>Epn</i> genes with overlapping functions. To overcome this problem, we have generated cells that lack all the three epsins by a conditional KO approach involving the OHT-dependent disruption of the <i>Epn1</i> gene in epsin 2 and 3 double KO mice."

                        "text": "A main conclusion of our study is the occurrence of a close coupling between the function of epsin and the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. While such coupling had been suggested by studies in unicellular organisms, studies of epsin in cells of metazoan had emphasized its role as a bilayer deforming protein (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ford et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boucrot et al., 2012</a>) and as a cargo-specific adaptor (<a href=\"#bib48\">Polo et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Overstreet et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chen and De Camilli, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Meloty-Kapella et al., 2012</a>). A link of epsin to actin function at endocytic clathrin-coated pits, and in particular a role as a factor that ensures a \u2018controlled\u2019 actin growth at sites of endocytosis, is supported by several observations. First, Hip1R, which had so far been considered the major link of endocytic clathrin coats to actin in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Engqvist-Goldstein et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Le Clainche et al., 2007</a>), is not recruited to endocytic clathrin-coated pits in the absence of epsin. This is consistent with the interaction and functional partnership of epsin with Sla2/Hip1R, previously demonstrated in yeast and <i>Dictyostelium</i>, although in yeast it is Sla2 that recruits epsin to clathrin-coated pits (<a href=\"#bib58\">Skruzny et al., 2012</a>). Second, the lack of epsin results in a disruption of the normal actin cytoskeleton with a major loss of stress fibers and an accumulation of actin foci at the cell surface, typically in proximity of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits. Third, epsin binds actin directly via its disordered tail region. Fourth, a cell-free assay of endocytosis involving plasma membrane sheets and brain cytosol revealed that relative to WT, epsin-deficient cytosol results in an exaggerated and abnormal growth of the actin cytoskeleton. These findings suggest a role for epsin in orchestrating a coupling between actin and endocytic clathrin coats that (1) limits excessive actin growth and (2) helps mediate an effect of actin polymerization on bud invagination. A functional partnership between epsin and Hip1R explains why the KD of Hip1R results in a similar enhanced and abnormal actin nucleation at endocytic sites, with the formation of large actin bundles projecting away from these sites (<a href=\"#bib23\">Engqvist-Goldstein et al., 2004</a>)."

Interestingly RLIP76/RalBP1, a protein with Cdc42 GAP activity, interacts with the ENTH domain of epsin (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ross\u00e9 et al., 2003</a>), although there is no clear sequence homology between RLIP76/RalBP1 and Rga proteins. In view of the modulatory role of Cdc42 in the nucleation of N-WASP-Arp 2/3-dependent actin nucleation at endocytic clathrin-coated pits, the recruitment of a Cdc42\u2013GAP by epsin could help explain why actin nucleation is enhanced in epsin null cells."

The force of actin polymerization may help drive the deep invagination of the pits and also assist in dynamin-dependent fission (<a href=\"#bib31\">Itoh et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Roux et al., 2006</a>) by developing a force that drives the deeply invaginated bud away from the plasma membrane. The occurrence of this force is well demonstrated by the dramatic actin-dependent elongation of the clathrin-coated pit necks in living cells and in cell-free systems (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ferguson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wu et al., 2010</a>), when the fission reaction is impaired by the lack of dynamin (living cells) or block of its GTPase activity (cell-free system), respectively. Clearly, however, epsin does not simply function as a negative regulator of actin polymerization, but it is required for proper spatial organization of the actin-based cytoskeleton, as exemplified by the abnormal localization of myosin 1E at sites of endocytic invaginations on plasma membrane sheets incubated with epsin TKO cytosol."

It was proposed that Notch activation requires a pulling force applied to Notch by the endocytosis of its ligand in the neighboring cell and that epsin may be essential for the generation of such force (<a href=\"#bib40\">Meloty-Kapella et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Musse et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shergill et al., 2012</a>). Based on our findings, such a requirement for epsin may be linked to its role in the control of actin dynamics at clathrin-coated pits.

As intracellular vesicles need SNAREs to fuse with their target membranes, a coupling must exist between vesicle budding and incorporation of the proper SNARE(s) in the bud. Accordingly, other coat adaptors with ANTH or ENTH modules, such as AP180/CALM and epsinR were shown to bind SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hirst et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Miller et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Koo et al., 2011</a>).

While this action seems plausible, our study strongly suggests that epsin becomes critically important at the earlier stages of clathrin coat maturation, as we have observed an accumulation of shallow and U-shaped endocytic clathrin-coated pits in epsin TKO cells. The diffuse, rather than punctate distribution of proteins that assemble at the necks of deeply invaginated endocytic clathrin-coated pits, such as dynamin 2, endophilin 2, and myosin 1E further supports a stalling of pits at an early stage in epsin TKO cells. In contrast to the observations made in epsin triple KD cells, we have not observed clearly multiheaded pits, although the dome of some pits was irregular. Multiheaded pits observed in epsin triple KD cells had been interpreted as reflecting a defect in fission. However, they do not have the constricted neck of multiheaded pits observed in dynamin mutant cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ferguson et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2009</a>) and at least some of them could represent a clustering of shallow or U-shaped pits. We note that the multiple endocytic functions of epsin are consistent with its localization throughout the coat (<a href=\"#bib28a\">Hawryluk et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sochacki et al., 2014</a>), rather than a selective localization at the bud neck to mediate fission."

Surprisingly, we did not find a major effect on cell division in cells derived from epsin 1 and 2 double KO embryos possibly because of long-term adaptation to decreased levels of epsin. For example, we have detected an upregulation of epsin 3 in epsin 1 and 2 double KO cells (our unpublished observations). Interestingly, epsin undergoes phosphorylation and mono- or oligo-ubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib61\">Stukenberg et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Polo et al., 2002</a>) in mitosis and these covalent modifications impair its binding to clathrin and AP-2, suggesting a switch of its function in the mitotic cytosol (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 1999</a>). A role of epsin in the dynamics of the cytoskeleton may underlie its role in mitosis, for example by affecting its anchoring to the cell cortex. Several other endocytic proteins, including clathrin, are also implicated in mitosis, and, in particular, in cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib52\">Royle, 2013</a>)."

Our findings, along with previous studies suggest the models depicted in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. Epsin is an early component of endocytic clathrin-coated pits, which interacts directly with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, AP-2, clathrin, and other early clathrin-coated pit components such as intersectin and Eps15. The partial bilayer penetration of its ENTH domain makes it optimally suited to function at a site where membrane buckling occurs (as a generator, sensor or stabilizer of curvature), while its low affinity binding to synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 may collaborate with AP180/CALM to ensure the coupling of bud nucleation to a membrane patch containing SNAREs. It may additionally participate in the recruitment to the pit of ubiquitinated cargo proteins via its UIMs, a function that does not apply to <i>Dictyostelium</i> epsin, which expresses a single epsin family protein lacking UIMs. As the bud expands, epsin along with Hip1R provide a link between actin nucleation and coat maturation, which is required for deep invagination. Finally, the membrane insertion properties of its helix zero may assist dynamin in the fission reaction. As we show here, however, its most critical function is at the transition between shallow/U-shaped and deep invaginated pits."

Although it is widely agreed that epsins are important players in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, there is still a lot of controversy over what they actually do. Part of the problem is that there are three epsin isoforms in mammals, encoded by different genes. Worms and flies both have only a single epsin gene and knockouts have been shown to impair Notch signaling (which requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis). Similarly, in a study by the De Camilli lab published five years ago, knocking out both of the ubiquitously expressed mouse epsin genes, epsin 1 and epsin 2, causes embryonic lethality in a way that can be explained by impairment of multiple Notch pathways. Importantly, clathrin-mediated endocytosis in general is not abolished in any of the epsin knockout animals."

The authors claimed that the reason this phenotype hadn't been observed before was that the three epsin isoforms were functionally redundant. This is in spite of the fact that expression of epsin 3 is highly tissue-specific, and the authors never investigated whether it was actually expressed in these cell lines. The Boucrot et al. paper also reported that in the epsin triple knockdown, the coated pits were arrested at scission, and that epsin could substitute for dynamin in dynamin-depleted cells. Micrographs showed \u201cmultiheaded\u201d clathrin-coated structures, appearing like bunches of grapes. It was difficult to know what to make of this paper, but until the present study, no other piece of work has come along to challenge it."

The take-home message is that in the epsin triple knockout cells, there is a partial block in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but the phenotype is quite different from that reported by Boucrot et al. Most importantly, the authors present several lines of evidence indicating that epsin plays a key role in linking clathrin to the actin cytoskeleton. This is the first evidence for such a role for epsin, and for a functional association between Hip1R and epsin, in animal cells; however, it fits in nicely with studies that have been carried out in yeast and <i>Dictyostelium</i>. The authors should be able to address all of the comments by making amendments to the text."

In opisthokonts (i.e., animals and fungi), there are two families of genes with similar ENTH (epsin N-terminal homology) domains. Epsin genes (e.g., EPN1, EPN2, and EPN3 in humans, and ENT1 and ENT2 in yeast) encode proteins that are associated with AP-2 and clathrin at the plasma membrane, and that contain ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs). EpsinR genes (e.g., CLINT1 in humans, and ENT3 and ENT5 in yeast) encode proteins that are associated with AP-1 and clathrin at intracellular membranes, and that interact with the Q-SNARE vti1b/Vti1p. However, most other eukaryotes have only one such protein, which has been defined as epsinR because it lacks UIMs (e.g., see Gabernet-Castello et al., 2009, Traffic 10: 894-911). Thus, when the authors report that their studies are in line with studies on Dictyostelium, where links between epsin, Hip1R, and actin were also reported, they need to be aware that the Dictyostelium protein is thought to be more like epsinR. Interestingly, however, the Dictyostelium protein localizes to both the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes, suggesting that the ancestral epsin/epsinR was able to contribute to both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and clathrin-mediated intracellular trafficking, but that then after a gene duplication in pre-opisthokonts, the two descendants became specialized for different pathways. Again, it would be good if there could be some clarification about epsin vs. epsinR in non-opisthokonts. In addition, the authors need to correct their statement on page 17 that \u201cepsin 1R\u201d binds V-SNAREs, because the correct name for the protein is epsinR, and the SNARE that it binds is a T-SNARE, not a V-SNARE."

While this action seems plausible, our study strongly suggests that epsin becomes critically important at earlier stages of clathrin coat maturation, as we have observed an accumulation of shallow and U-shaped endocytic clathrin-coated pits in epsin TKO cells. The diffuse, rather than punctate distribution of proteins that assemble at the necks of deeply invaginated endocytic clathrin-coated pits, such as dynamin 2, endophilin 2 and myosin 1E further supports a stalling of pits at an early stage in epsin TKO cells. In contrast to observations made in epsin triple KD cells we have not observed clearly multiheaded pits, although the dome of some pits was irregular. Multiheaded pits observed in epsin triple KD cells had been interpreted as reflecting a defect in fission. However, they do not have the constricted neck of multiheaded pits observed in dynamin mutant cells and at least some of them could represent a clustering of shallow or U-shaped pits. We note that the multiple endocytic functions of epsin are consistent with its localization throughout the coat, rather than a selective localization at the bud neck to mediate fission.\u201d"
