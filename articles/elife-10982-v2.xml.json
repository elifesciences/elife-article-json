Along with the t-SNARE Syntaxin 18, we now reveal the complete complement of SNAREs required in this process, t-SNAREs BNIP1 and USE1, and v-SNARE YKT6. TANGO1 recruits YKT6-containing ER Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC) membranes to procollagen VII-enriched patches on the ER. Moreover residues 1214-1396, that include the first coiled coil of TANGO1, specifically recruit ERGIC membranes even when targeted to mitochondria. TANGO1 is thus pivotal in concentrating procollagen VII in the lumen and recruiting ERGIC membranes on the cytoplasmic surface of the ER. Our data reveal that growth of a mega transport carrier for collagen export from the ER is not by acquisition of a larger patch of ER membrane, but instead by addition of ERGIC membranes to procollagen-enriched domains of the ER by a TANGO1-mediated process."

Along with the t-SNARE Syntaxin 18, we now reveal the complete complement of SNAREs required in this process, t-SNAREs BNIP1 and USE1, and v-SNARE YKT6. TANGO1 recruits YKT6-containing ER Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC) membranes to procollagen VII-enriched patches on the ER. Moreover residues 1214-1396, that include the first coiled coil of TANGO1, specifically recruit ERGIC membranes even when targeted to mitochondria. TANGO1 is thus pivotal in concentrating procollagen VII in the lumen and recruiting ERGIC membranes on the cytoplasmic surface of the ER. Our data reveal that growth of a mega transport carrier for collagen export from the ER is not by acquisition of a larger patch of ER membrane, but instead by addition of ERGIC membranes to procollagen-enriched domains of the ER by a TANGO1-mediated process."

Given their abundance and importance, an understanding of the mechanism by which collagens are sorted, packaged and exported across the secretory pathway, is of fundamental importance. A challenge arises from the fact that procollagens contain rigid, rod-like triple-helical domains that can reach 450 nm in length (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burgeson et al., 1985</a>) and are too large to be exported from the ER by conventional COPII (Coat Protein complex II)-coated vesicles of 60\u201390 nm diameter (<a href=\"#bib13\">Glick and Malhotra, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Malhotra et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Miller and Schekman, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Saito and Katada, 2015</a>). Vesicles generated by a COPII-dependent mechanism have been characterised extensively (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barlowe et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lee et al., 2004</a>) and it is clear that they are too small for procollagen export from the ER. So, how are collagens exported from the ER?"

The SH3-like domain of TANGO1 is required for its binding to procollagen VII in the ER lumen. On the cytoplasmic side, the second coiled coil domain of TANGO1 binds a protein called cTAGE5 and the C-terminal proline rich domains (PRD\u2019s) of TANGO1 and cTAGE5 interact with the COPII coat proteins Sec23A and Sec24C (<a href=\"#bib30\">Saito et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Saito et al., 2011</a>). Together, these proteins nucleate a complex that drives procollagen VII export from the ER (<a href=\"#bib21\">Malhotra et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Miller and Schekman, 2013</a>). TANGO1 mediates export of the only collagen expressed and secreted by Drosophila, and TANGO1 knockout mice are defective in the sorting and export of many collagens (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wilson et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, TANGO1 connects procollagens in the lumen of the ER to the cytoplasmic components of the COPII coats."

We decided to identify all four SNAREs in the complex involved in procollagen VII export and, by localising the v-SNARE involved, identify the source of membranes in this fusion reaction. Syntaxin 18 (STX18), an ER-resident t-SNARE, and the SNARE-activity-promoting protein SLY1 are required for procollagen VII export, but not the t-SNARE Syntaxin 17 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nogueira et al., 2014</a>).

Mitochondrial membrane-targeting domains are shorter than transmembrane domains of proteins inserted into the ER. We therefore generated a construct containing the TEER domain, but this time including only a short section of its transmembrane domain (residues 1188\u20131396 of TANGO1) tagged with a Myc epitope (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

Mitochondria were visualised using MitoTracker or an anti-ATP5A1 antibody. Our results revealed that both constructs localise to mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). To determine the topology of the mitochondrially targeted TEER (Mit-TEER) and CC-TMCC3 (Mit-CC-TMCC3), we performed a protease protection assay. A protein facing the cytoplasm is susceptible to proteolytic digestion, whereas a membrane encased protein is resistant in the absence of detergents. A crude mitochondrial membrane\u00a0preparation was carried\u00a0out from HeLa cells that were transiently transfected with either Mit-TEER or Mit-CC-TMCC3. Subsequently, these membrane preparations were incubated for one hour with proteinase K in the presence or absence of 1% NP40. Both Mit-TEER and Mit-CC-TMCC3 were degraded upon incubation of membranes with proteinase K in the absence of detergent; in contrast, ATP5A1, a subunit of the mitochondrial inner membrane-localised ATP synthase, was intact under the same conditions. As expected, inclusion of detergent further led to the degradation of ATP5A1 by proteinase K (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These data show that Mit-TEER and Mit-CC-TMCC3 are inserted into outer mitochondrial membranes and are exposed to the cytoplasm."

To address this possibility, we first transfected HeLa cells with Mit-TEER and observed the localisation of endogenous TANGO1. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis revealed no significant association between endogenous TANGO1 and Mit-TEER (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> - left panel - and C), indicating that TEER at mitochondria does not interact with TANGO1 located at ER exit sites. In addition, we confirmed that there was no significant targeting of Mit-TEER to the ER (Manders\u2019 overlap coefficient between Myc and calreticulin is 0.306 \u00b1 0.05). To further exclude any role of endogenous TANGO1 in this recruitment, we generated a HeLa cell line where endogenous TANGO1 was knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 (\u0394TANGO1) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Mali et al., 2013</a>). Western blots confirmed complete depletion of TANGO1 in two different HeLa cell clones (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and as expected collagen VII secretion was severely inhibited (see methods, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Mit-TEER, when transfected in \u0394TANGO1 cells recruited ERGIC-53-containing membranes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> - right panel - and C). Together, these data strongly indicate that the TEER domain recruits ERGIC-53-containing membranes to regions of the ER decorated with TANGO1."

Unlike a standard COPII vesicle of 60\u201390 nm diameter that is moulded exclusively from the ER membrane by COPII coats, the growth of a mega-carrier for procollagen VII export depends on the addition of membranes from a non-ER source (<a href=\"#bib22\">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Malhotra et al., 2015</a>).

However, knockdown of TANGO1 dissociated ERGIC membranes from these patches (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), strongly indicating the involvement of TANGO1 in this recruitment. We mapped this function to amino acids 1214\u20131396 of TANGO1, corresponding to the first coiled coil domain in the cytoplasm. This \u201cTEER\u201d domain of TANGO1, when expressed at the surface of mitochondria, was able to specifically recruit ERGIC-53 membranes, but not COPII components or membranes representing early or late Golgi cisternae (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

The fact that not all ERGIC-53 membranes are recruited by TANGO1\u2019s TEER domain and a specific set of SNAREs are required for fusion with the ER provides an explanation for our observation that TANGO1 knockdown does not alter general ER protein export or retrograde traffic from Golgi to the ER (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nogueira et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Saito et al., 2009</a>)."

The fusion of ERGIC membranes to procollagen VII-enriched domains provides a means for the growth of a mega export carrier commensurate with cargo size.

This suggests 100\u2013200 TANGO1-cTAGE5 dimers at each exit site and if each TANGO1 (cTAGE5 does not contain a procollagen binding site in the lumen of the ER) binds a procollagen trimer, this would pack 100\u2013200 fully folded trimers of procollagen into a mega-carrier at each ER exit site. We suggest that after packing approximately this quantity of procollagen, the separation of the collagen-filled carrier is triggered by dissociation of TANGO1 from procollagen VII and its concomitant detachment from Sec23/Sec24. Sec13/Sec31 would then be recruited to Sec23/Sec24 at the neck of the container filled with procollagen VII for its movement further along the secretory pathway (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking reagent and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488, Alexa 594 or Alexa 647 were diluted in blocking reagent and incubated for 1\u2009hr at room temperature. For YKT6 localisation studies, HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated constructs; after 48\u2009hr after transfection, cells were processed for immunofluorescence. Briefly, cells were washed twice with room temperature KHM buffer (125 mM potassium acetate, 25 mM HEPES [pH 7.2], and 2.5 mM magnesium acetate). Cells were permeabilised by incubation in KHM with 0.1% Saponin for 5\u2009min on ice followed by washing for 7\u2009min on ice with KHM buffer. Cells were subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. For staining of mitochondria, before fixation, cells were incubated with a final concentration of 200 nM of MitoTracker (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30\u2009min in serum-free medium or, after fixation and permeabilisation immunostaining was carried out with anti-ATP5A1. Images were taken with a Leica TCS SPE or Leica TCS SP5 confocal with a 63x objective. Two-channel colocalisation analysis was performed using ImageJ, and the Manders\u2019 correlation coefficient was calculated using the plugin JaCop (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bolte and Cordelieres, 2006</a>)."

Briefly RDEB/FB/C7 cells were transfected with siRNA as described above. 24\u2009hr after the last siRNA transfection, the medium was replaced with a fresh medium containing 2 \u03bcg/ml ascorbic acid. Medium with ascorbate was added to the cells for 20\u2009hr to allow for collagen secretion. The media were centrifuged at low speed to remove any cells or cellular debris and then the supernatant was boiled for 5\u2009min with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer. For cell lysis, the cells were washed with PBS, lysed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were boiled for 5\u2009min with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer. Both media and cell lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE (6% acrylamide) and western blotting with Collagen VII, SEC31 and Tubulin antibodies. ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland) was used for quantification. Values plotted are a ratio of the signal obtained from the intensities of bands of collagen VII in the medium to those in the corresponding lysate to obtain a quantitative measure of collagen secretion free from variations that arise due to differences in cell densities. A similar procedure was used to measure secretion from HeLa cells that were transfected with Collagen VII-FLAG. Briefly, control or CrispR HeLa cells lacking TANGO1 (\u0394TANGO1) were transfected with a FLAG-epitope-tagged collagen VII plasmid. 28\u2009hr later, cells were washed and changed into medium with ascorbate for 20\u2009hr. The cell lysate and medium were processed to assess secretion of Collagen VII as described for RDEB/FB/C7 cells."

These membranes were split into three fractions. The first was kept as a control; to the second fraction was added proteinase K (0.1\u00a0mg/ml); and to the third fraction, we added both proteinase K as well as the detergent NP40 (at a final concentration of 1%). Samples were incubated on ice for one hour to allow proteinase K to digest all accessible protein. The reaction was terminated by the addition of PMSF (1\u00a0mM) for ten minutes and then immediate boiling at 100\u00b0C for ten minutes along with acrylamide gel loading buffer. Western blotting was performed on these samples using an anti-Myc antibody and an antibody against the mitochondrial matrix protein ATP5A1 (a subunit of the ATP synthase, localised to the mitochondrial inner membrane). We compared the accessibility of the respective proteins to proteinase K in the presence and absence of detergent. Loss of a Mit-TEER/Mit-CC-TMCC3 in the absence of detergent would indicate that the protein was exposed to the cytoplasm. The mitochondrial inner membrane protein ATP5A1 served as a control to confirm that mitochondrial membranes were intact at the outset of the experiment and remained so in the absence of detergent (NP40)."

Please add quantitation of the overlap between an ER marker and the mitoTEER construct. Also, how much ERGIC overlap is seen with mitotracker in cells not expressing mitoTEER? This is important because it impacts the significance of mitoTEER retargeting of ERGIC in their experiments. There are more and more reports of close interaction between ER and mitochondria that are important for lipid exchange. Please look closely at this section and address this with careful quantitation.

I think the authors should change their description of the data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> (subsection \u201cA domain in TANGO1 directly recruits ERGIC membranes\u201d). However, the data shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> are much more convincing, indicating that a sub-population of ERGIC compartments (YKT6 positive) are indeed recruited, as the authors eventually discuss.
