For palmitoylation to occur, membrane association is a prerequisite, but it is unclear which motif may increase the affinities of the proteins for the target membrane. In experiments with rat neuroendocrine cells, we find that a few basic amino acids in the cysteine-rich region of SNAP25 and SNAP23 are essential for plasma membrane targeting. Reconstitution of membrane-protein binding in a liposome assay shows that the mechanism involves protein electrostatics between basic amino acid residues and acidic lipids such as phosphoinositides that play a primary role in these interactions. Hence, we identify an electrostatic anchoring mechanism underlying initial plasma membrane contact by SNARE proteins, which subsequently become palmitoylated at the plasma membrane."

For palmitoylation to occur, membrane association is a prerequisite, but it is unclear which motif may increase the affinities of the proteins for the target membrane. In experiments with rat neuroendocrine cells, we find that a few basic amino acids in the cysteine-rich region of SNAP25 and SNAP23 are essential for plasma membrane targeting. Reconstitution of membrane-protein binding in a liposome assay shows that the mechanism involves protein electrostatics between basic amino acid residues and acidic lipids such as phosphoinositides that play a primary role in these interactions. Hence, we identify an electrostatic anchoring mechanism underlying initial plasma membrane contact by SNARE proteins, which subsequently become palmitoylated at the plasma membrane."

The cysteine-rich region has four cysteines for palmitoylation in the centre, which are flanked by four lysines on each side (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). The sequence around the cysteines also contains five acidic amino acids: four upstream and one downstream of the cysteines. Hence, eight basic and five acidic amino acids yield a net charge of\u00a0+3 located downstream of the cysteine cluster."

SNAP25 constructs that\u00a0showed strong effects in live cells and the constructs without palmitoylation\u00a0sites were studied by cell fractionation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In contrast to the imaging analysis, the biochemical cell fractionation experiment makes\u00a0it\u00a0possible to relate the absolute amounts of the membrane and cytosol fraction to each other. In line with the imaging experiments, we observed that SNAP25<i>-5</i> has\u00a0a weaker and SNAP25+<i>10</i> a\u00a0stronger membrane association than wt-SNAP25 (<i>+3</i>). In the imaging experiment, no membrane-associated fraction of SNAP25<sub>(<i>C-to-G</i>)\u00a0</sub>or SNAP25+<i>10</i><sub>(<i>C-to-G</i>)\u00a0</sub>was visible. This is different in the membrane fractionation assay where we detected a small membrane-associated fraction for SNAP25+<i>10</i><sub>(<i>C-to-G</i>)</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This fraction might have been overlooked by confocal microscopy, which is unable to resolve small plasma\u00a0membrane-associated pools in the presence of a strong cytosolic background. For a better microscopic analysis, it was necessary to eliminate the cytosolic background. We therefore turned to \u2018unroofed cells\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Heuser, 2000</a>), also called plasma membrane sheets. To achieve this, cells were exposed to a brief ultrasound pulse that exerts a shearing force to the upper cellular parts, leaving behind the basal plasma membranes. Then, the membrane sheets were imaged to quantify the recruited protein in the absence of the cytosolic background. Wt-SNAP25 (+<i>3</i>), SNAP25<i>-5</i> and SNAP25+<i>10</i> were readily detected on the membrane sheets (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) in amounts that\u00a0would be\u00a0expected from the confocal microscopic subcellular distribution analysis. SNAP25<sub>(</sub><i><sub>C-to-G</sub></i><sub>)</sub> was not detectable, either\u00a0because it is present at undetectable amounts after membrane sheet generation (see also the hardly detectable membrane fraction of SNAP25<sub>(</sub><i><sub>C-to-G</sub></i><sub>)</sub> in the cell fractionation assay in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), or because\u00a0it binds weakly and washes off during sample mounting and imaging (which takes up to \u2248 35 min\u00a0in total). By contrast, SNAP25\u00a0+<i>10</i><sub>(<i>C-to-G</i>)</sub> was clearly present, despite the absence of palmitoylation sites, documenting a higher plasma\u00a0membrane affinity when compared to SNAP25<sub>(</sub><i><sub>C-to-G</sub></i><sub>)</sub>."

A disturbed interaction with palmitoyl transferases is unlikely as all of\u00a0the\u00a0substitutions are located distal to the QPARV motif which is important for the interaction of SNAP25 and DHHC palmitoyl transferases (<a href=\"#bib11\">Greaves et al., 2010</a>). However, some mutations map to the N-terminal SNARE motif of SNAP25 that interacts with plasmalemmal syntaxin 1A. Early studies on SNAP25 plasma\u00a0membrane targeting proposed syntaxin as the receptor for initial contact establishment (<a href=\"#bib22\">Vogel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Washbourne et al., 2001</a>), although a subsequent study provided compelling evidence against this hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Loranger and Linder, 2002</a>)."

This assay is capable of probing interactions between SNAP25 and syntaxin by measuring the mobility of SNAP25 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Halemani et al., 2010</a>). Mobility diminishes the stronger SNAP25 binds to syntaxin and the more syntaxin is present. The slow-down is dependent on a syntaxin\u2013SNAP25 interaction, as it requires the N-terminal SNARE motif of SNAP25. Moreover, a mutant carrying introduced prolines in the N-terminal SNARE-motif of SNAP25 (prolines interfere with the alpha-helix formation, which in turn is required for SNARE-complex formation) moves almost independently of the syntaxin concentration (<a href=\"#bib12\">Halemani et al., 2010</a>). We tested our constructs on membrane sheets with or without co-expressed syntaxin 1A-RFP. Syntaxin 1A-RFP slows down the mobility of wt-SNAP25 (+<i>3</i>), SNAP25<i>-5</i> and SNAP25+<i>10</i> in a similar fashion, arguing against an altered capability of complex formation caused by the introduced mutations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

Replacing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> profoundly increased binding, but largely diminished the differences between SNAP25 constructs. This suggests that the presence of additional negative charges creates additional binding contacts, which are probably outside of the cysteine-rich region. In order to keep the number of negative charges comparable to those provided by 4% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> was reduced to 2.8%. This condition yielded a stronger difference in binding in the range between the cell fractionation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and the membrane sheet assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

The latter mechanism has been described for MARCKS, where 13 basic residues laterally sequester three PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gambhir et al., 2004</a>). The increased membrane binding observed after introducing additional positive charges (SNAP25<i>+10</i>) may reflect a MARCKS-protein-like PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding behaviour not physiologically relevant for the targeting of SNAP25/SNAP23. Once formed, such a protein-lipid aggregate seems difficult to dissolve, as SNAP25+<i>10</i><sub>(<i>C-to-G</i>)</sub>\u00a0remains attached to the membrane for more than 30 min (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

This suggests that a random electrostatic contact is not sufficient for targeting. Rather, electrostatic anchoring needs to position the cysteine(s) in a way that facilitates palmitate attachment. The electrostatic contact thus needs to be established by amino acids close to the cysteine residues. Such a mechanism would also explain why the\u00a0diminishment of positive charges is always accompanied by a loss of targeting, because fewer positive charges will decrease the binding affinity and/or change the geometry of the established contact. On the other side, not all mutants with an increased positive charge show increased membrane targeting. Some actually exhibit a trend towards lesser binding. Perhaps the contact can also become too tight for the attachment of palmitates. Hence, the short targeting motif seems to be optimized to mediate electrostatic anchoring, while still allowing for access to the cysteines for the\u00a0attachment of palmitates."

Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 x g at room temperature for 3 min and the pellet was washed with PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 750 \u00b5l ice-cold homogenization buffer (300 mM sucrose, 5 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF freshly added; pH 7.4). Using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer, cells were kept on ice and homogenized in a volume of 0.75 ml by applying 100 strokes. The homogenate was centrifuged for 8 min at 800 x g at 4\u00b0C, yielding pellet P1 (containing non-homogenized cell debris) and supernatant S1. S1 was transferred into a new tube for a second centrifugation step for 120 min at 20,000 x g and 4\u00b0C, yielding pellet P2 (containing the enriched membrane fraction, which was resuspended in 750 \u00b5l homogenization buffer) and the supernatant S2 with the cytosolic fraction. Protein concentrations of P2/S2 were adjusted to the\u00a0lowest concentration in the series, before adding respective amounts of 4x Laemmli buffer followed by incubation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. Samples of 10 \u00b5g per lane were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis using a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred onto a Roti-NC nitrocellulose membrane (Carl Roth, Germany) applying semi-dry blotting. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with PBS-T (0.05% Tween20 in PBS) containing 5% milk powder for one hour, and incubated with primary antibody against GFP diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were washed for 20 min with PBS-T\u00a0three times. For detection a second antibody tagged with HRP (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_631747\">AB_631747</a>, Cat# sc-2030, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) was applied for 1 hr and, after washing three times with PBS-T, chemiluminescence was detected with Luminol Reagent (sc-2048, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) using autoradiographic films. Films were scanned and band intensities were quantified\u00a0from the digital images."

After one hour, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 15% delipidized FCS (PAN biotech) and 100 \u00b5M palmitate-alkyne (a kind gift from the Thiele lab, LIMES Institute, Bonn). After 15 hr of feeding, cells were harvested via trypsinization and scraping, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Triton, 1x cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM HEPES; pH 7.2). Lysis was promoted by vortexing and sonication. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 x g, and the supernatant was bound to a GFP-trap (Chromotek) for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C to immunoprecipitate the GFP-SNAP25 fusion constructs.

For the lipid mixes containing brain L-\u03b1-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) or 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-<i>sn</i>-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-myo-inositol-3',4',5'-trisphosphate) (PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>) the amount of PI was reduced accordingly. The lipids were dissolved in chloroform or chloroform/methanol (3:1 ratio, for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>), mixed and dried under a flow of nitrogen. The remaining chloroform was removed by vacuum for 4 hr. The lipids were dissolved in 1 ml reconstitution buffer (25 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, 200 mM KCl, 1% (w/v) OG (n-Octyl-\u03b2-D glucopyranoside), 1 mM DTT (1,4-dithiothreitol)) by 30 min shaking. To form liposomes, OG was diluted below the critical micelle concentration by the addition of 2 ml buffer (25 mM HEPES/KOH; pH 7.4, 200 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT). The residual OG was removed by flow dialyses with 4 L 25 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, 135 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT overnight. Subsequently, a Nycodenz gradient centrifugation was performed to isolate the liposomes. Therefore, the dialyzed samples were mixed with an equal volume of 80% (w/v) Nycodenz and transferred into two SW60-tubes (Beckman Coulter). Layers of 750 \u00b5l 35% (w/v) Nycodenz, 150 \u00b5l 11.6% (w/v) Nycodenz and 100 \u00b5l fusion buffer were added on top of the 40% (w/v) Nycodenz/liposome solution. The gradient was spun at 55,000 rpm for 3 hr 40 min at 4\u00b0C. The liposomes were isolated, followed by a buffer exchange (25 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, 135 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DDT) using a PD MiniTrap G-25 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The amounts of lipids were quantified by measurement of Atto647N fluorescence (excitation 639 nm, emission 669 nm) in a Fluoroskan Ascent FL Microplate Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific)."

Basic residues were identified in the cys cluster of SNAP25/SNAP23 that promotes initial plasma membrane association of SNAP25/SNAP23 which precedes the stable membrane attachment mediated by palmitoylation of cysteines. The authors performed an extensive set of mutagenesis, imaging, and fractionation experiments to support this conclusion. Coarse grain MD simulations were then performed to study random collisions between the corresponding peptides and a membrane and conclude that PIP2 is essential for the membrane association of the peptide. They support this notion by a competition experiment between SNAP-25 and the PH domain of phospholipase C-\u03b4 for PIP2."

We found that the mobility of SNAP25 carrying mutations in the N-terminal part of the first SNARE-motif (Mutations M32P and V36P) is almost independent from the syntaxin concentration. After introducing the mutations in the C-terminal half of the first SNARE- motif (I60P, M64P), which still allows the N-terminal part to partially interact with syntaxin, a 30% slow-down is observed.
