Here we describe a new experimental approach, called Tite-Seq, that is capable of measuring binding titration curves and corresponding affinities for thousands of variant antibodies in parallel. The measurement of titration curves eliminates the confounding effects of antibody expression and stability that arise in standard deep mutational scanning assays. We demonstrate Tite-Seq on the CDR1H and CDR3H regions of a well-studied scFv antibody. Our data shed light on the structural basis for antigen binding affinity and suggests a role for secondary CDR loops in establishing antibody stability. Tite-Seq fills a large gap in the ability to measure critical aspects of the adaptive immune system, and can be readily used for studying sequence-affinity landscapes in other protein systems."

Here we describe a new experimental approach, called Tite-Seq, that is capable of measuring binding titration curves and corresponding affinities for thousands of variant antibodies in parallel. The measurement of titration curves eliminates the confounding effects of antibody expression and stability that arise in standard deep mutational scanning assays. We demonstrate Tite-Seq on the CDR1H and CDR3H regions of a well-studied scFv antibody. Our data shed light on the structural basis for antigen binding affinity and suggests a role for secondary CDR loops in establishing antibody stability. Tite-Seq fills a large gap in the ability to measure critical aspects of the adaptive immune system, and can be readily used for studying sequence-affinity landscapes in other protein systems."

The antigenic specificity of antibodies in humans, mice, and most jawed vertebrates is primarily governed by six complementarity determining regions (CDRs), each roughly 10 amino acids (aa) long. Three CDRs (denoted CDR1H, CDR2H, and CDR3H) are located on the antibody heavy chain, and three are on the light chain. During B-cell differentiation, these six sequences are randomized through V(D)J recombination, then selected for functionality as well as against the ability to recognize host antigens. Upon participation in an immune response, CDR regions can further undergo somatic hypermutation and selection, yielding higher-affinity antibodies for specific antigens. Among the CDRs, CDR3H is the most highly variable and typically contributes the most to antigen specificity; less clear are the functional roles of the other CDRs, which often do not interact with the target antigen directly."

In DMS experiments, one begins with a library of variants of a specific protein. Proteins that have high levels of a particular activity of interest are then enriched via one or more rounds of selection, which can be carried out in a variety of ways.

But no DMS assay has yet been shown to provide absolute quantitative binding affinity measurements, i.e., dissociation constants in molar units. For example, one of the first DMS experiments (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fowler et al., 2010</a>) used phage display technology to measure how mutations in a WW domain affect the affinity of this domain for its peptide ligand. These data were sufficient to compute enrichment ratios and corresponding sequence logos, but they did not yield quantitative affinities. Analogous experiments have since been performed on antibodies using yeast display (<a href=\"#bib34\">Reich et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kowalsky et al., 2015</a>) and mammalian cell display (<a href=\"#bib12\">Forsyth et al., 2013</a>). Yeast-display-based DMS assays have also proven particularly useful for mapping protein epitopes that are targeted by specific antibodies of interest (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kowalsky et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Doolan and Colby, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Van Blarcom et al., 2015</a>). Still, none of these approaches provides quantitative affinity values. SORTCERY (<a href=\"#bib34\">Reich et al., 2015</a>, ), a DMS assay that combines yeast display and quantitative modeling, has been shown to provide approximate rank-order values for the affinity of a specific protein for short unstructured peptides of varying sequence. Determining quantitative affinities from SORTCERY data, however, requires separate low-throughput calibration measurements (<a href=\"#bib42\">Reich et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, it is unclear how well SORTCERY, if applied to a library of folded proteins rather than unstructured peptides, can distinguish sequence-dependence effects on affinity from sequence-dependent effects on protein expression and stability. Other recent work has described a DMS assay, again based on yeast display, for measuring fold-changes in affinity relative to a reference protein (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kowalsky and Whitehead, 2016</a>). This method, however, does not provide absolute values for dissociation constants, is vulnerable to the confounding effects of sequence-dependent expression and protein stability, and was observed to have only a 10-fold dynamic range."

Our model assumed that the <math id=\"inf150\"><mrow><msub><mi>log</mi><mn>10</mn></msub><mo>\u2061</mo><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>D</mi></msub></mrow></math> value for an arbitrary amino acid sequence could be computed from the <math id=\"inf151\"><mrow><msub><mi>log</mi><mn>10</mn></msub><mo>\u2061</mo><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>D</mi></msub></mrow></math> value of the WT scFv, plus the measured change in <math id=\"inf152\"><mrow><msub><mi>log</mi><mn>10</mn></msub><mo>\u2061</mo><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>D</mi></msub></mrow></math> produced by each amino acid substitution away from WT. We evaluated our matrix models on the 1H and 3H variable regions of OPT, finding an affinity of <math id=\"inf153\"><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>9.16</mn></mrow></msup></math> M. Our simple model for the sequence affinity landscape of this scFv therefore correctly predicts that OPT has higher affinity than WT. The quantitative affinity predicted by our model does not match the known affinity of the OPT scFv (<math id=\"inf154\"><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>D</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>12.6</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math> M), but this is unsurprising for three reasons. First the OPT scFv differs from WT in 14 residues, only 6 of which are inside the 1H and 3H variable regions assayed here. Second, one of the OPT mutations (W108L) reduces <math id=\"inf155\"><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>D</mi></msub></math> below our detection threshold of <math id=\"inf156\"><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>9.5</mn></mrow></msup></math> M; in building our matrix model, we set this value equal to <math id=\"inf157\"><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>9.5</mn></mrow></msup></math>, knowing it would likely underestimate the affinity-increasing effect of the mutation. Third, our additive model ignores potential epistatic interactions. Still, we thought it worth asking how likely it it would be for six random mutations within the 1H and 3H variable regions to reduce affinity as much as our model predicts for OPT. We therefore simulated a large number (<math id=\"inf158\"><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>7</mn></msup></math>) of variants having a total of 6 substitution mutations randomly scattered across the 1H and 3H variable regions. The fraction of these random sequences that had an affinity at or below our predicted affinity for OPT was <math id=\"inf159\"><mrow><mn>4.7</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math>. This finding is fully consistent with the fact that the mutations in OPT relative to WT were selected for increased affinity, an additional confirmation of the validity of our Tite-Seq measurements."

These results suggest two things. First, the 3H variable region appears to have a larger effect on scFv expression than the 1H variable region has. At the same time, since we observe fewer beneficial mutations in 1H (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) than in 3H (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), the WT sequence appears to be more highly optimized for expression in CDR1H than in CDR3H.

Our data (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) suggest that these confounding effects can be large and that they can distort yeast display affinity measurements computed from enrichment statistics gathered at a single antigen concentration. Strong sequence-dependent effects on both the expression and specific activity of yeast-displayed proteins has been reported by other groups as well (e.g., [<a href=\"#bib5\">Burns et al., 2014</a>]), although the absence of such effects has also been reported (e.g., [<a href=\"#bib23\">Kowalsky and Whitehead, 2016</a>]). Ultimately, the magnitude of these effects is likely to vary substantially from protein to protein. It should also be noted that many DMS studies using yeast display (e.g., epitope mapping studies [<a href=\"#bib22\">Kowalsky et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Doolan and Colby, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Van Blarcom et al., 2015</a>]) might not suffer from these potentially confounding effects, and in such cases it probably makes sense to employ a simpler experimental design than is required for Tite-Seq. Nevertheless, either\u00a0Tite-Seq or other experimental methods that assay full binding curves are probably essential if one wants to quantitatively and reliably measure <math id=\"inf195\"><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>D</mi></msub></math> values in a massively parallel fashion."

Our work illustrates the importance of designing massively parallel assays that can disentangle these effects. Tite-Seq provides a general solution to this problem for massively parallel studies of protein-ligand binding. Indeed, the Tite-Seq procedure described here can be readily applied to any protein binding assay that is compatible with yeast display and FACS. Many such assays have been developed (<a href=\"#bib26\">Liu, 2015</a>). We expect that Tite-Seq can also be readily adapted for use with other expression platforms, such as mammalian cell display (<a href=\"#bib12\">Forsyth et al., 2013</a>)."

As expected, we found that variation in and around CDR3H had a larger effect on affinity than did\u00a0variation in and around CDR1H. We also found that CDR1H is more optimized for protein expression than is CDR3H, an unexpected finding that appears to be novel. Yeast display expression levels are known to correlate with thermostability (<a href=\"#bib39\">Shusta et al., 1999</a>). Our data is limited in scope, and we remain cautious about generalizing our observations to arbitrary antibody-antigen interactions. Still, this finding suggests the possibility that secondary CDR regions (such as CDR1H) might be evolutionarily optimized to help ensure antibody stability, thereby freeing up CDR3H to encode antigen specificity. If this hypothesis holds, it could provide a biochemical rationale for why CDR3H is more likely than CDR1H to be mutated in functioning receptors (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liberman et al., 2013</a>) and why variation in CDR3H is often sufficient to establish antigen specificity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xu and Davis, 2000</a>)."

By comparing the effects of mutations with the known antibody-fluorescein co-crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib49\">Whitlow et al., 1995</a>), we identified a strong correlation between the effect that a position has on affinity and the number of molecular contacts that the residue at that position makes within the antibody. By contrast, no such correlation of expression with this number of contacts is observed. Again, we are cautious about generalizing from observations made on a single antibody. If our observation were to hold for other antibodies, however, it would suggest that the functional geometry of paratopes might be governed by networks of residues whose positions and orientations are strongly interdependent."

Yeast display experiments were performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boder et al., 2000</a>) with modifications; see Appendix 2. Sorted cells were regrown and bulk DNA was extracted using standard techniques, and amplicons containing the 1H and 3H variable regions were amplified using PCR and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq platform; see Appendix 4. Three replicate experiments were performed on different days. Raw sequencing data has been posted on the Sequence Read Archive under BioProject ID PRJNA344711. Low-throughput flow cytometry measurements were performed on clones randomly picked from the Tite-Seq library. Sequence data and flow cytometry data were analyzed using custom Python scripts, as described in Appendices 5 and 6.

Replicates are a standard in recent deep mutational scanning studies (e.g. PMID 25723163, 25006036), and we would require one before accepting the paper.

If so, that would be a very important limitation. This same point applies to the low-throughput assays. In the original Wittrup paper (cited in this manuscript), low-throughput replicates yielded <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> estimates that varied by no more than 2-fold. Here, the <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> estimates vary by two orders of magnitude. The reason appears to be that the range of ligand concentrations does not contain the <i>K<sub>D</sub></i>, which is a basic requirement of a proper titration curve."

E.g., is the difference of 56% vs. 41% of mutations above the detection limit (in subsection \u201cE. Differing effects of mutations in CDR1H and CDR3H\u201d, first paragraph) a large one, or maybe not even distinguishable given the accuracy of the experiment?

First, the authors fail to cite and discuss substantially similar work. Their elucidation of <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> values for a large library of variants does represent an advance, but it's incremental. The work must be discussed in the context of what has come before. Second, several of the analyses are poorly described and, if I understood them correctly, will inflate the reader's confidence in the method. In particular, the method for estimating error for each <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> value is insufficient. Both of these points are particularly important because the manuscript is focused on the method itself rather than an important/exciting application.

Overview of Tite-Seq\u201d, the authors make the point that, if curve fitting is to be successful, the <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> value must fall within the range of ligand values used. However, for the validation data shown, the fit <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> values are generally at the very low end of the ligand concentration range. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, most of the titration curves more closely resemble flat lines. This can be explained by the fact that the <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> of the WT is 0.7e-9 M whereas the lowest concentration of ligand used was 1e-8.5 M. I am puzzled as to why the authors chose to employ a ligand concentration range that did not include the known <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> of the WT sequence. In the Discussion they mention \"experimental details,\" that constrained them, but I'd suggest a fuller and earlier disclosure of these limitations. Given that most antibody-antigen interactions have <i>K<sub>D</sub>s</i> at least as low as the one studied, I wonder whether the method could really be generally applied."

First, neither statement makes totally clear what the authors did/what is shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. Furthermore, MSE usually used when the parametric value of an estimator is known. For the flow data, we don't have parametric values, just three replicates. So, a confidence interval would be more appropriate. Finally, and most troublingly, the authors have elected to present the mean variance/MSE of all three clones rather than the variance (or CI, or whatever) of each clone independently. I can't think of a good reason to do this. Because the WT replicates happened to look great while the two clones didn't, using the mean of all three is misleading. The authors should improve this analysis and then better explain it. Also, note the repeated \"computed.\""

If I understood the procedure, the error is assumed to be wholly dependent on read depth. The read depth vs. signal to noise/error plot (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) is really noisy, which suggests that the read depth alone does not capture all of the error. Many factors are known to impact experiment-to-experiment variability (e.g. PCR bias, experimenter error, etc.) in these types of experiments.

However, the reviewers identified a number of shortcomings that led us to decide against recommending acceptance of the manuscript. In particular, the manuscript as written clearly is fundamentally a methodology paper rather than a paper reporting a novel new biological result. However, many of the standards necessary to establish the robustness and reproducibility of a new method are not adequately met. The policy of eLife is to not require revisions that would involve large amounts of new work, and as you will see below it would require substantial new work to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. We recognize that you may therefore either prefer to submit the paper elsewhere, or make extensive changes and re-submit to eLife. Below I outline what I consider to be the main points so that you are aware of them if you choose the latter route. In addition, the full reviewer comments are pasted below. An experimental replicate is needed to assess reproducibility of the method. While we appreciate the effort to develop an error model using synonymous counts, for a new high-throughput methodology, the only robust ways to assess errors is to perform an independent replicate of the experiment and assess the variation between replicates. Replicates are a standard in recent deep mutational scanning studies (e.g. PMID 25723163, 25006036), and we would require one before accepting the paper. It is not essential that the replicates have perfect correlations (we don't expect that they will), but it is necessary to have some independent means of assessing the noise and validating which findings are robust to this noise. Reviewer 2's point about what \"experimental details\" constrained the use of ligand values outside the KD range must be addressed \u2013 is the method inapplicable to antibodies with higher affinities? If so, that would be a very important limitation. This same point applies to the low-throughput assays. In the original Wittrup paper (cited in this manuscript), low-throughput replicates yielded KD estimates that varied by no more than 2-fold. Here, the KD estimates vary by two orders of magnitude. The reason appears to be that the range of ligand concentrations does not contain the KD, which is a basic requirement of a proper titration curve. eLife's policy is to encourage making data and computer code available. We encourage you to do this regardless of whether you re-submit to eLife or elsewhere. The reviews list a variety of other easy-to-fix points, such as better citations of the literature and clarification of unclear points.</i>"

First, the authors fail to cite and discuss substantially similar work. Their elucidation of KD values for a large library of variants does represent an advance, but it's incremental. The work must be discussed in the context of what has come before. Second, several of the analyses are poorly described and, if I understood them correctly, will inflate the reader's confidence in the method. In particular, the method for estimating error for each KD value is insufficient.

The read depth vs. signal to noise/error plot (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) is really noisy, which suggests that the read depth alone does not capture all of the error. Many factors are known to impact experiment-to-experiment variability (e.g. PCR bias, experimenter error, etc.) in these types of experiments. Replication would enable much more robust error estimation, and would considerably strengthen the work.</i> "
