Less clear is whether intergenic lncRNAs commonly regulate transcription by modulating chromatin at genomically distant loci. Here, we report both genomically local and distal RNA-dependent roles of <i>Dali</i>, a conserved central nervous system expressed intergenic lncRNA. <i>Dali</i> is transcribed downstream of the <i>Pou3f3</i> transcription factor gene and its depletion disrupts the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. Locally, <i>Dali</i> transcript regulates transcription of the <i>Pou3f3</i> locus. Distally, it preferentially targets active promoters and regulates expression of neural differentiation genes, in part through physical association with the POU3F3 protein. <i>Dali</i> interacts with the DNMT1 DNA methyltransferase in mouse and human and regulates DNA methylation status of CpG island-associated promoters in trans. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that a single intergenic lncRNA controls the activity and methylation of genomically distal regulatory elements to modulate large-scale transcriptional programmes."
