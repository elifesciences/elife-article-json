Consequently, sensory systems often adjust their neural code to the expected statistics of their sensory input to transmit novel sensory information. Here, we show that sudden peripheral motion amplifies and accelerates information transmission in salamander ganglion cells in a 50 ms time window. Underlying this gating of information is a transient increase in adaptation to contrast, enhancing sensitivity to a broader range of stimuli. Using a model and natural images, we show that this effect coincides with an expected increase in information in bipolar cells after a global image shift. Our findings reveal the dynamic allocation of energy resources to increase neural activity at times of expected high information content, a principle of adaptation that balances the competing requirements of conserving spikes and transmitting information."

Then, either the entire image or only the central object moved.

However, when the whole image moved, the cells also responded to lower-contrast images, showing that they had switched to processing the local region of the scene in more detail. These effects could be reproduced in a simple mathematical model."

To achieve better performance in the current condition, many sensory systems measure the recent sensory statistics and adjust their responses to the expected sensory input. For example, adaptation in the visual system adjusts a cell\u2019s dynamic range based on the expected stimulus distribution, including the stimulus mean (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barlow and Levick, 1969</a>) and variance (<a href=\"#bib52\">Victor and Shapley, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Smirnakis et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Nagel and Doupe, 2006</a>).

In addition, inhibition from fast, large global shifts may reflect the instantaneous expectation that an eye movement is occurring, and play a role in saccadic suppression (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roska and Werblin, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Geffen et al., 2007</a>)."

Underlying this increase in information in neural responses is a more complete adaptation to the local stimulus, allowing for both low and high local contrast environments to be encoded with a similar response range. This rapid change in the neural code causes the cell to encode the intensity sequence of the stimulus and the contrast at different times relative to the global shift, thus causing peripheral motion to act as a timing signal to coordinate the encoding across a population of cells. We further show that these effects can be produced by a simple model combining local and peripheral inputs prior to a threshold and an adaptive stage. Finally, using the same model we show that the pulse of increased information that we observed when stimulating the periphery matches in timing the expected arrival of novel information generated by a global image shift as would occur during motion of a large object or an eye/head movement."

We chose a set of brief stimuli that could produce a wide variation in excitation \u2013 from extremely weak to very strong \u2013 depending on a cell\u2019s location, to determine the effect of peripheral excitation, and how that effect varies with the cell\u2019s central excitation. The stimulus consisted of a central square object with a constant luminance in\u00a0front of a checkerboard peripheral pattern. The object covered the classical linear receptive field center plus part of the surround of most cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, top panel). To present the same central stimulus in the presence and absence of strong peripheral stimulation, either the object alone (object shift) or the whole stimulus (global shift) was shifted abruptly by one peripheral square, 50 \u00b5m in length, ~1 degree of visual field in the salamander. We then varied the central luminance level to measure the effect of the strong peripheral stimulus in encoding the luminance of the central stimulus. When the object moved alone, many cells showed transient activity, which depended on the location of the cell relative to the object border (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, left column). As expected, those cells near the center of the object showed the weakest activity because they experienced little change in light intensity, and overall, the response was insensitive to the central luminance value. In the global shift condition, however, brief strong firing events occurred during both right and left shifts for most cells including those in the center of the object (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, right column). To assess the effect of the peripheral shift on the ability of a cell to distinguish different central stimuli, we computed the slope of a line fit to the firing rate as a function of the log of central intensity, and found this slope to be much greater during the global shift (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We examined which cells were most strongly affected by the periphery by comparing responses to all constant luminance objects under both peripheral conditions. In doing so, we found that the cells with the weakest response to the object condition showed the greatest enhancement of sensitivity from peripheral motion, with 39 out of 76 cells at least doubling the slope of their firing rate vs. the log of central luminance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This increased activity during the global shift condition could not be attributed to the linear receptive field of the cell overlapping the object border, as steps to the right and left would have linear contributions of opposite signs, even if such stimuli might be within the spatial region occupied by the classical receptive field surround (<a href=\"#bib12\">Demb et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Borghuis et al., 2013</a>). Accordingly, the effect of the global shift was mostly insensitive to the phase of the checkers in the periphery (see Materials and methods). Thus, peripheral stimulation enhanced the sensitivity to weak central stimuli during abrupt global image motion."

To create a local naturalistic input, the central object intensity flickered with a temporal power spectrum resembling natural scenes, which was inversely proportional to the frequency \u2013 called \u2018pink noise\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Simoncelli and Olshausen, 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, right panel inset).

This indicates that the increase in firing rate after the peripheral shift is not due to a response independent of the center stimulus, as such an effect would have shifted the nonlinearity vertically, leaving the sensitivity to the center unchanged (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, dashed line). Instead, we find that an abrupt peripheral shift dynamically gates the response of a cell, enhancing the cell\u2019s sensitivity to its preferred visual feature near the receptive field center."

On any given trial, the decision to fire is primarily controlled by the central input and in many cases, no spikes occurred when the periphery moved. Nonetheless, the brain could use a population of cells to identify the gating window as a time when activity increases synchronously throughout the retina. Our analysis using the number of spikes in a time bin neglects more complex encoding due to latency (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gollisch and Meister, 2008</a>) and firing patterns in the population (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schnitzer and Meister, 2003</a>).

After a shift, the information conveyed was 0.47 \u00b1 0.04, (n = 18 cells) of the maximal value, compared with 0.24 \u00b1 0.05 before the shift. Thus, after the shift, the neural code used more of the capacity of the cell given its noise properties and the spike count code. However, this came at the increased cost of energy in terms of a higher firing rate (6.9 \u00b1 1.7 Hz after the shift, and 1.9 \u00b1 0.3 before the shift). Previous results indicate that the high threshold of ganglion cells allows them to conserve spikes at the expense of maximal information transmission (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pitkow and Meister, 2012</a>). Our analysis indicates that after a peripheral shift, the neural code shifts away from energy conservation and towards high-throughput information transmission."

We observed that both excitation and inhibition from a peripheral shift depended on the central contrast, with a much stronger increase in firing observed at low contrast (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This result is consistent with the observation that cells with the weakest response to a moving square had the strongest effect from peripheral stimuli (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We then fitted LN models as stated above at different contrasts during 50 ms time windows corresponding to gating, suppression, and recovery (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a>).

We therefore tested how peripheral stimulation influenced adaptation to the central contrast by measuring changes in adaptation as a function of time since the peripheral shift. For an ideally adapting cell, the sensitivity would scale in inverse proportion to the contrast (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). Previous results, however, have shown that ganglion cells adapt less than this ideal amount, in particular at low contrasts (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ozuysal, 2012</a>). We found that in the gating window, responses to different contrasts were much more similar to each other, indicating a greater level of adaptation to the central contrast (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This effect arose because at low contrast, the slope of the nonlinearities changed more than at high contrast, similar to the stronger effects of gating seen with cells that responded more weakly to a shifting object (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). At 3% contrast, the slope changed by 5.5 \u00b1 1.1 Hz per contrast unit (one s.d. of the nonlinearity input was 0.03 contrast units, or 3% ) and at 24% contrast the slope changed by 0.20 \u00b1 0.06 Hz per contrast unit (one s.d. was 0.24 contrast units, or 24% ) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). As a result of these effects at different contrasts, during the gating window nonlinearities reached a more similar height across contrasts. Accordingly, when normalized by the stimulus standard deviation at each contrast, nonlinearities also had a more similar shape across contrasts in the gating window. We computed an index of adaptation that takes the value of 1 for an ideally adapting cell and 0 for a non-adapting cell (see Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>), and found that most cells increased their adaptation to contrast during the gating window, such that all contrasts were represented with more similar responses than during the recovery window (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This indicates that an increase in adaptation underlies the increase in information during the gating window, such that near the receptive field center, both weak and strong signals are conveyed."

This central pathway model was analogous to an accurate model of contrast adaptation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ozuysal, 2012</a>), where the rectified nonlinearity and adaptation likely occur at the bipolar cell synaptic terminal, although here we used a simplified adaptive stage. Nonlinear peripheral input is delivered only in the inner retina, as horizontal cells do not respond to fine gratings (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baccus et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, the only remaining choice in the model structure was the level at which to combine the peripheral input. Because a peripheral shift caused the overall nonlinearity of the LN model to shift laterally, rather than vertically with respect to the central pathway\u2019s linear input (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>), the peripheral pathway delivers input prior to the nonlinearity, corresponding to input to the bipolar cell terminal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The peripheral pathway can be represented by small rectified subunits that cause the\u00a0response to be insensitive to the peripheral pattern (<a href=\"#bib52\">Victor, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Olveczky et al., 2003</a>). Rather than explicitly simulate spatiotemporal dynamics of the periphery, we modeled the net effect of the abrupt peripheral stimulus via a timed biphasic signal. The model effectively replicated the data for Gaussian stimuli at different contrasts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C, D</a>), as well as for constant luminance stimuli (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Furthermore, weak stimuli only cross threshold when peripheral input is applied (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), allowing the adaptive stage to encode and adapt to signals of all strengths, including those from a central stimulus with a constant intensity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, when peripheral excitation is present (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), the model applies a lower threshold relative to the central input, conveying more information about the full range of contrast environments, but less information about the contrast level.

To measure the distance over which lateral excitation acts, we designed a stimulus to measure peripheral gating of sensitivity to a central object as a function of distance from the peripheral stimulus. The stimulus had three different components. First, the periphery was composed of 50 \u03bcm checkers that covered the whole screen. Second, on top of the periphery, a mean intensity gray mask covered the peripheral checkers over the central region; the size of the mask, <i>L,</i> was varied. Third, the central object consisting of a pink noise flickering sequence was then added on top of the central gray region and was presented as a fenestrated checkerboard pattern of fixed size (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>). By decreasing the mask size, more peripheral checkers were present, and the distance between peripheral checkers to any measured cell was decreased. At the smallest mask sizes, peripheral checkers were intercalated with the central region object, and occupied all space not covered by the central object (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, bottom). The excitatory influence of gating acted at distances of up to 1 mm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This further confirms that the effect was distinct from the linear receptive field, which would not be activated by a fine checkerboard at this distance. The observed changes in sensitivity indicate that excitatory and inhibitory influences acted over a similar scale, equivalent to a radius of ~20 deg. of visual angle."

This subtraction was not done for the recovery window because at distances less than 500 \u00b5m, residual inhibition creates a saturating decrease in sensitivity, causing many cells to have zero slope at this time.

In the gating time window, a change in the neural code is explained by a simple additive signal prior to a threshold followed by an adaptive stage. As a result, a broader range of signals is transmitted, with a stronger effect on weak, low-contrast stimuli commonly found in natural scenes (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tadmor and Tolhurst, 2000</a>). This gating of information transmission, caused by the peripheral signal, results in more complete adaptation to the image contrast as compared to other times. We explain the functional importance of this effect as the resolution of two competing needs: conservation of spikes and the rapid encoding of information when it is expected that information in the center will suddenly increase."

However, for natural images and\u00a0an abrupt global shift in the image as from motion of a large object, the eye or head, the transient effect of gating would be combined with transient changes in image statistics created by the image shift. We therefore compared the timing of our gating results (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) to the dynamics of the expected information transmission for natural scenes during an abrupt shift in the image. The statistics over the receptive field center depend both on the image and the sequence of eye movements, and have strong correlations over time. Consequently, attaining representative statistics of the distributions of both light intensity and responses over multiple time points requires many trials. Owing to the difficulty in sampling the high dimensional distribution of the stimulus and responses over multiple time points (see Materials and methods), such an experiment would be prohibitively long. We therefore addressed this question using a spatiotemporal version of our model of gating with simulated eye movements and a large number of natural images."

The spatiotemporal model used for fast Off-type ganglion cells had the same structure as the reduced model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), but we replaced the initial linear filter with the spatiotemporal receptive field measured from a fast Off-type bipolar cell (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baccus et al., 2008</a>). Because peripheral gating is delivered prior to the threshold in the model, it is likely that it represents an input presynaptic to the bipolar cell terminal. Furthermore, because strong adaptation to contrast is thought to arise in the presynaptic terminal, the model is effectively of the synaptic release from bipolar cells, although the actual density of bipolar cells was not modeled. Thus, although further nonlinearities exist in the inner retina that would make the responses of ganglion cells to natural scenes more complex, we expect this model will be informative as to the relative timing of bipolar cell release and peripheral gating. Fast Off-type bipolar cells are roughly linear at a constant mean intensity for a stimulus that flickers (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) or jitters as in fixational eye movements, and previous models indicate that these cells may convey the primary input to fast Off-type ganglion cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baccus et al., 2008</a>). Because the model was used to estimate the information transmitted after a global image shift, we measured the noise in bipolar cells at different contrasts. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increased with contrast, which was incorporated into the model ( <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A-iii</a>, see Materials and methods)."

Furthermore, because we did not include luminance adaptation, the model effectively assumes that during the fixation period, adaptation has reached a steady state, and that the global shift is too brief to cause substantial luminance adaptation. The main goal of the model, however, was to gain insight into the dynamics of information transmission under sudden image shifts."

Because natural images have strong correlations, and because bipolar cell receptive fields are biphasic both in space and time, fixational drift created a relatively small change in the filtered stimulus (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A-ii</a>). However, for a brief window of time after the shift, the light intensity seen by the bipolar cell was less correlated with its previous values (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B, D and F</a>). During this window, a wider range of possible filtered stimuli occurred, but still with most values remaining close to zero and under the fixed threshold (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A-ii, B</a>). Based on the noise measurements in bipolar cells, because of the higher variance after the shift, the SNR of the bipolar cell membrane potential would be expected to increase. Note that these simulations do not include the effects of moving objects in the environment, which would cause the stimulus to more closely resemble experiments in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, where central and peripheral inputs are uncorrelated."

Because of strong correlations in the stimulus (discussed further below), sequential measurements of the intensity in a new environment are largely redundant, and thus may not convey added information. To account for this effect, we estimated the novel information learned about the stimulus from a response given that the system has access to the previous response.

As expected, because during fixational eye movements responses are highly correlated in time, each additional sample conveyed little novel information. However, after the sudden shift moved the receptive field to a new location, the conditional mutual information abruptly increased (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, solid line). Unlike the mutual information at different times relative to the shift, <math id=\"inf45\"><mrow><mi>I</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>;</mo><mi>R</mi><mo>|</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>, the conditional mutual information captures the intuition that most of the information about the new environment should occur in a short amount of time (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

We found that these greatly overlapped, meaning that the active increase in information produced by gating is timed to match the expected increase in novel information generated by the shift. Given the statistics of natural scenes and the measured noise in bipolar cells, our model indicates that gating represents a mechanism that increases information transmission at the expected peak of novel information after a global shift in the image."

However, it is clear that information transmission is not the only objective, as the threshold of retinal ganglion cells is much higher than predicted by this ideal. Consequently, it has been proposed as an alternative factor that ganglion cells conserve spikes at the expense of maximal information transmission (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pitkow and Meister, 2012</a>). We propose that neither view of a neural code optimized for a single current environment \u2013 either for maximal information transmission or for energy efficiency \u2013 is fully representative of natural vision. Our findings indicate that a peripheral shift causes a switch from a code that conserves energy to one of increased information transmission, with higher information transmission occurring at the expected time of higher signal-to-noise ratio and higher information content. These results suggest a general principle of neural coding \u2013 the dynamic allocation of neural activity to times most likely to contain novel information. This principle of adaptation acts to allocate resources across environments, and in fact is analogous to known principles of communication theory that act to enhance dynamic information transmission under an energy constraint."

Because a higher variance signal has a higher SNR in the bipolar cell (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A-iii</a> [<a href=\"#bib37\">Ozuysal, 2012</a>]), this principle agrees with our observation that additional spiking is allocated to times of expected high variance of the filtered stimulus (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D</a>).

Accordingly, the property of object motion sensitivity related to fixational eye movements is common to both salamanders and mammals. Similarly, the basic phenomenon of peripheral retinal excitation has been observed in mammals, and we expect that effects on neural coding we observe here will be similar. The duration of the ~1 degree global image shifts we have used (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) is one stimulus frame (~30 ms), similar to the duration of a ~1 degree saccade in a number of species, for rabbit, cat and monkey, 20\u201350 ms (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collewijn and Zuidam, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Evinger et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fuchs and Johns, 1967</a>); humans, ~20 ms (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baloh et al., 1975</a>); and fish, ~70 ms (Easter,\u00a01975). Although larger saccadic eye movements are longer in duration, the key property we find is that the timing of the linear filter in the receptive field center is coincident with temporal filtering from the peripheral input. Thus, even if the global shift is more smooth as in the case of a larger saccade or an amphibian head saccade, we expect that the excitation from both center and periphery will still coincide."

In these cases, an efferent copy of a motor command can provide the timing signal. But because the retina lacks such an efferent copy, a signal that the stimulus is changing must be computed from the sensory input. Inhibitory amacrine cells are known to deliver signals laterally across long distances, and could increase the firing rate through synaptic disinhibition (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barlow et al., 1977</a>). We note that a similar organization is found in the hippocampus, where a common signal is generated by oscillations in inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 2002</a>). On the principle that the threshold should be lowered when greater information is expected, synchronous oscillations between brain regions may perform a similar function of allocating sensitivity to time intervals of greater information content."

In the Still condition, the periphery was static and in the Shift condition the peripheral checkerboard shifted every 0.5 s. As stated above, each time relative to the peripheral period was analyzed separately, so that under each condition there was no information between the response of a cell and the periphery\u2019s position. Although the central sequences were not the same for each time bin relative to the peripheral shift, by having 200 central sequences per periphery we limit the chance of biasing any particular periphery by associating it with more (or less) discriminable central stimuli. Center sequences were identical between the Still and the Shift conditions, and therefore the differences between <math id=\"inf57\"><mrow><mi>I</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>;</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>|</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> under still and shift for any peripheral stimulus <i>p</i> is only attributable to the one difference in the experimental conditions, the presence or absence of peripheral stimulation.

As to a plausible origin of this input, the peripheral effect occurred for a high spatial frequency checker and did not depend on the direction of the shift. Such a response could be generated by a group of rectified subunits as found in the receptive fields of polyaxonal amacrine cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baccus et al., 2008</a>), but this was not explicitly implemented here. Because <i>a</i>(<i>t</i>) had two phases, positive and negative, whereas polyaxonal amacrine cells are thought only to deliver inhibition, it is expected that the positive phase would arise through disinhibition delivered through a second intervening amacrine cell that provides tonic inhibition."

However, for constant luminance experiments, equation (10) reduces to a constant independent of the luminance value when <i>\u03b1\u00a0</i>=\u00a00, therefore non-zero values of \u03b1 are needed. Thus, the value of alpha was optimized to yield changes in adaptation as observed in the data, as well as responses to different levels of constant luminance.

Thus, the filter in the model should correspond to the spatiotemporal receptive field of a bipolar cell, which we took from our previous measurements of fast-Off bipolar cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baccus et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In order to use the model to assess information transmission, we measured the noise in the membrane potential of bipolar cells as a function of contrast and found that the level of noise increases roughly linearly with contrast (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A-iii</a>). This allowed us to choose a noise level at each time point that depended on the filtered stimulus, approximating measured bipolar cell noise."

Because the filtering and noise of bipolar cells was measured at a fixed mean intensity, to avoid the need to incorporate luminance adaptation into the model, we normalized the mean intensity of all images. The linear receptive field center and surround were modeled independently, with each being a filter separable in space and time. Spatial linear predictions were made by convolving each image with a spatial disk of 1.0 and 2.5 degrees of visual space corresponding to center and surround. To compute the complete linear prediction of cells, images were jittered around according to a random walk with mean velocity of 0.33\u00b0 per second simulating fixational eye movements and an instantaneous saccade simulated by a step of 6\u00b0 in a random orientation in the image location. The temporal receptive fields for the center and surround were convolved with this image series and summed, generating the complete linear prediction for each location as a function of time; g<i><sub>x,t</sub></i> where <i>x</i> denotes the location and <i>t</i> the time.

This created the greatest noise during the gating window, and thus potentially underestimates the actual information conveyed. From the signal standard deviation at a particular time, an equivalent Gaussian contrast was found that would generate a linear prediction with the same standard deviation. With the equivalent Gaussian contrast, a level of noise was chosen such that the signal to noise ratio was the same in the simulation and in the bipolar cell\u2019s measured membrane potential noise under repetitions of Gaussian stimulation at different contrasts (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A-iii</a>,\u00a0upper panel).

First, it is not clear how well the sudden spatial shift of the peripheral stimulus replicates the types of eye/head movements made by salamanders. Some key features \u2013 such as coherent motion across the retina (and receptive field) \u2013 are certainly missing. Second, the importance of peripheral stimuli for coding depends on the frequency of such events. How often do salamanders make rapid head movements? These issues are particularly important given the underlying theme in the paper that the interaction between peripheral and central stimuli serves to create an energetically efficient neural code (Abstract, first paragraph of Introduction). An alternative, framework for the paper is the literature on how non-classical surround stimulation alters responses."

The evidence for the model is quite indirect, and it is not clear whether the model is unique in its ability to capture the data. This raises concerns about how well the model will capture a broad range of inputs \u2013 particularly inputs not directly tested. Because of this issue, I found the section of the paper describing responses to natural stimuli tenuous. A specific concern about the model is whether adaptation is located appropriately in the model (e.g. photoreceptors adapt strongly to luminance, which seems important to account for). The location of adaptation relative to the combination of peripheral and central responses is critical to the model (as pointed out in the paper), and hence needs to be tested more completely. Another concern is the assumption that the bipolar cell responses to natural inputs are linear (and can be captured by a simple impulse response). This should be tested. A third concern is how the eye movement trajectories were generated, and whether those are appropriate for salamander (see above). Given these issues I think the model results need to be discussed more tentatively or qualified as being subject to the caveats associated with the model."

Early on the paper the authors say that \"the object covered the classical linear receptive field center plus part of the surround of most cells\", suggesting that perhaps a majority of the cells would have some portion of the peripheral checkerboard pattern within their classical RF surround. There are several analyses showing that similar effects of left and right shifts (which would be expected to have opposite effects on a linear surround) \u2013 this seems to be the main form of evidence that we're not seeing classical RF surround effects. But I don't know enough about salamander retina to know whether this is reasonable or not. For example, do we know definitively that these cells don't have more complex cat Y-like surrounds?"

But it would be helpful to see some numbers here about the size of the typical RF center and surround for these neurons. Mostly I'd like to see the authors make a slightly more careful distinction between effects we might expect from the RF surround vs. those we're seeing here. (Or, conversely, if the RF surround contributes strongly to these effects, overlaid with some additional long-range mechanisms, it would be worth knowing that as well)."

But I'm curious to know if the authors ever examined other kinds of changes to the peripheral stimulus, e.g., a change of the spatial pattern that doesn't look anything like a motion stimulus. In other words, is a big change in the surround stimulus sufficient to give rise to these effects, or does it specifically require motion? I wouldn't consider this necessary for publication if the authors haven't gathered any such data, but if they have reason to argue for the specificity of motion \"shift\" stimuli, I'd like to hear it.

So that doesn't sound like a tradeoff. I was expecting it to achieve higher total information flow but at lower efficiency. Can you speculate about why it's efficient at high spike rates and inefficient at low spike rates?

The new data added to the paper on bipolar responses do not make a convincing case for linearity of the bipolar responses to natural stimuli. Specifically, while the bipolar responses appear close to linear for 20% contrast noise stimuli (as in new figure), the natural scene stimuli seem very likely to involve much larger changes in input (typical scenes include regions that differ 20-50 fold in intensity). Hence the model involves extrapolation of the bipolar responses well beyond the range where linearity was tested. As noted in the previous round of reviews, photoreceptors are known to adapt strongly to changes in their mean input. It is not clear from the paper what the statistics of the natural inputs are for the model in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, but it would be surprising if the photoreceptor responses were linear across these stimuli. Published work supports nonlinearities in the photoreceptor responses to natural inputs (Endeman and Kamermans, 2010). Normalizing the mean of the entire image is not adequate to prevent adaptation in the photoreceptors since that process will not change the fact that separate regions differ substantially in intensity, and dynamic adaptation will occur during movement of the image on the retina."

Early on the paper, the authors say that \"the object covered the classical linear receptive field center plus part of the surround of most cells\", suggesting that perhaps a majority of the cells would have some portion of the peripheral checkerboard pattern within their classical RF surround. There are several analyses showing that similar effects of left and right shifts (which would be expected to have opposite effects on a linear surround) \u2013 this seems to be the main form of evidence that we're not seeing classical RF surround effects. But I don't know enough about salamander retina to know whether this is reasonable or not. For example, do we know definitively that these cells don't have more complex cat Y-like surrounds? The evidence presented later in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> would seem to allay these concerns, due to the fact that the effect extends out to 1mm (20 degree eccentricity) from the RF, which is presumably far outside the classical RF. But it would be helpful to see some numbers here about the size of the typical RF center and surround for these neurons. Mostly I'd like to see the authors make a slightly more careful distinction between effects we might expect from the RF surround vs. those we're seeing here. (Or, conversely, if the RF surround contributes strongly to these effects, overlaid with some additional long-range mechanisms, it would be worth knowing that as well).</i>"

Even if the nonlinear effect did arise from the spatial region occupied by the linear receptive field surround or even center, this nonlinear effect must arise from a pathway distinct from the ones that generate the linear receptive field. The evidence on <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> further supports this, because a fine grating at such a distance would not activate the linear receptive field surround, even once again if the surround extended to this distance. We clarify these two points in paragraph four of the subsection \u201cDuring global shifts, peripheral stimulation increases the response to local stimuli\u201d, and in \u201cPeripheral excitation and inhibition act across a similar spatial scale\u201d."

The new data added to the paper on bipolar responses do not make a convincing case for linearity of the bipolar responses to natural stimuli. Specifically, while the bipolar responses appear close to linear for 20% contrast noise stimuli (as in new figure), the natural scene stimuli seem very likely to involve much larger changes in input (typical scenes include regions that differ 20-50 fold in intensity). Hence the model involves extrapolation of the bipolar responses well beyond the range where linearity was tested. As noted in the previous round of reviews, photoreceptors are known to adapt strongly to changes in their mean input. It is not clear from the paper what the statistics of the natural inputs are for the model in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, but it would be surprising if the photoreceptor responses were linear across these stimuli. Published work supports nonlinearities in the photoreceptor responses to natural inputs (Endeman and Kamermans, 2010). Normalizing the mean of the entire image is not adequate to prevent adaptation in the photoreceptors since that process will not change the fact that separate regions differ substantially in intensity, and dynamic adaptation will occur during movement of the image on the retina.The manuscript should be revised either by directly testing the model assumptions, if the authors have those data available, or shifting the model into the Discussion and treating in more like a 'toy' or heuristic model with the assumptions that the model is based on (and caveats to those assumptions) stated clearly.</i>"
