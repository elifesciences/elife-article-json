Yet most neuroscientific studies of learning consider reinforcement history alone, irrespective of knowledge acquired through other means. We examined fear conditioning and reversal in humans to test whether instructed knowledge modulates the neural mechanisms of feedback-driven learning. One group was informed about contingencies and reversals. A second group learned only from reinforcement. We combined quantitative models with functional magnetic resonance imaging and found that instructions induced dissociations in the neural systems of aversive learning. Responses in striatum and orbitofrontal cortex updated with instructions and correlated with prefrontal responses to instructions. Amygdala responses were influenced by reinforcement similarly in both groups and did not update with instructions. Results extend work on instructed reward learning and reveal novel dissociations that have not been observed with punishments or rewards. Findings support theories of specialized threat-detection and may have implications for fear maintenance in anxiety."

Yet most neuroscientific studies of learning consider reinforcement history alone, irrespective of knowledge acquired through other means. We examined fear conditioning and reversal in humans to test whether instructed knowledge modulates the neural mechanisms of feedback-driven learning. One group was informed about contingencies and reversals. A second group learned only from reinforcement. We combined quantitative models with functional magnetic resonance imaging and found that instructions induced dissociations in the neural systems of aversive learning. Responses in striatum and orbitofrontal cortex updated with instructions and correlated with prefrontal responses to instructions. Amygdala responses were influenced by reinforcement similarly in both groups and did not update with instructions. Results extend work on instructed reward learning and reveal novel dissociations that have not been observed with punishments or rewards. Findings support theories of specialized threat-detection and may have implications for fear maintenance in anxiety."

Experiments have shown that giving people verbal instructions on how to obtain rewards alters the activity of the striatum and prefrontal cortex. That is, the instructions interact with the circuit that also supports learning through experience. But is this the case for learning how to avoid punishments? That process depends largely on the amygdala, and it is possible that systems designed to detect threats may be less sensitive to verbal warnings."

Telling the participants about the reversal in advance triggered changes in the activity of the striatum and part of the prefrontal cortex. By contrast, such warnings had no effect on the amygdala. Instead, the activity of the amygdala changed only after the volunteers had experienced for themselves the new relationship between the pictures and the shocks."

However, a subset of participants did not show differential SCRs prior to the first reversal. As our primary research question concerns the effects of instructions on the neural systems of aversive reversal learning, the strongest tests are in those individuals who learn contingencies prior to the first reversal. Given this, we restricted our analyses to 'learners.' As described in Materials and methods, we defined learners as those individuals who showed greater SCR to the CS+ relative to the CS- in late acquisition (the second half of the first run; 20/30 Instructed Group participants, 20/38 Uninstructed Group participants). In this subset of learners, the main effects and interactions on SCR reported above remained significant and increased in magnitude (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Importantly, both the Instructed and Uninstructed Groups showed SCRs that were responsive to changing contingencies when we examined each group separately, and when we restricted analyses to trials that followed the first reversal (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), suggesting that effects were not driven entirely by initial learning. The Uninstructed Group showed significant reversals when we analyzed trials from the second half of each block in this post-acquisition analysis, and marginal effects when we included all post-acquisition trials (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This is expected given the low reinforcement rate (33%) that we used in this study, and is consistent with somewhat slow learning. The quantitative models and fMRI analyses reported below focus on the 20 learners in each group. Combined fMRI analyses that include data from the full sample are entirely consistent with these findings and are reported in figure supplements and source data."

To this end, we focused on the computation of expected value (EV) and used a simple Rescorla-Wagner model modified to capture flexible effects of instructions and test for dissociations. Our quantitative models assume that SCR at cue onset reflects EV (see Materials and methods). Shocks were incorporated as reinforcements, and thus positive EV corresponds to an expectation for a shock. Consistent with standard Rescorla-Wagner models, EV updates in response to prediction error (PE), and the speed of updating depends on learning rate (\u03b1). We focus on correlations with EV in this manuscript, due to concerns of algebraic collinearity when EV, shock, and PE are included in the same model."

Models fit to the Instructed Group\u2019s SCRs, however, should capture the immediate effects of instruction reported above. To acknowledge this flexible effect of instructions, we modified the standard Rescorla-Wagner model. We introduced an instructed reversal parameter, <i>\u03c1</i>, which determines the extent to which EV reverses upon instruction (see Materials and methods). If \u03c1 = 1, the EVs of the two CSs are swapped completely when instructions are delivered, whereas if \u03c1 <i>=</i> 0, each CS maintains its current EV and the model reduces to a standard experiential Rescorla-Wagner model. The best-fitting parameters when fit across Instructed Group subjects revealed that EV reversed almost completely at the time of instructions in the Instructed Group (\u03c1 = 0.943; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), suggesting that instructions immediately influence EV/SCR, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>. When we fit the same model to SCRs from the Uninstructed Group (for whom the additional effect should not be observed since no instructions were given) estimates were indeed consistent with associations not reversing at the time when the instructions would have been delivered (\u03c1 = 0.0; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The resulting time course, which captures slower reversals of EV based on purely feedback-driven learning, is depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>. We also fit the model to individual participants in both groups (see Materials and methods) and found that instructed reversal parameters (i.e. \u03c1) differed significantly as a function of Group (<i>Instructed Group &gt; Uninstructed Group,</i> t(38) = 6.53, p&lt;0.0001; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

Thus our computational neuroimaging analyses proceeded in two stages, guided by the quantitative models reported above. First, we examined each group separately using the model fit to behavior in that group. Thus we used the model depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> to isolate neural correlates of feedback-driven learning in the Uninstructed Group, and the model depicted in\u00a0<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> to isolate neural correlates of instruction-based learning in the Instructed Group. Next, we directly compared the two sources of learning in the Instructed Group, since these participants were exposed to both forms of feedback (i.e. instructions about contingencies and reversals, as well as experiential learning from reinforcement between each reversal). In each analysis, we focused on results in amygdala, striatum, and VMPFC/OFC (see <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) to determine whether these <i>a priori</i> regions of interest (ROIs) were sensitive to feedback-driven learning and/or whether they updated with instructions. Finally, we tested the conclusions from quantitative models with task-based analyses that relied strictly on our experimental design, thus eliminating the influence of assumptions derived from our models."

Regressors were based on the best-fitting parameters from the model fit to the Uninstructed Group, thus isolating feedback-driven EV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; see Materials and methods). ROI-based analyses within the Uninstructed Group revealed a main effect of Region (F(2,40) = 5.13, p=0.011). Post-hoc t-tests revealed that this was driven by positive correlations between feedback-driven EV and responses in the amygdala (bilateral: t(1,19) = 4.21, p=0.0005; Left: t(1, 19) = 3.94, p=0.001; Right: t(1,19): = 3.72, p=0.001) and striatum (bilateral: t(1,19) = 2.31, p=0.0017; left: t(1, 19) = 2.58, p=p =0.018; right: p=p =0.063). Voxel-wise FDR-corrected results confirmed ROI-based findings, and isolated additional correlations in the VMPFC/mOFC (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">2</a>). The striatum and amygdala both showed positive correlations with EV, associated with increased activation for the stimulus currently predicting an aversive outcome. The VMPFC/mOFC showed negative correlations with EV, consistent with prior work showing increased VMPFC/OFC responses to conditioned stimuli predicting safe, relative to aversive, outcomes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schiller et al., 2008</a>). Additional regions that correlated with feedback-driven EV are reported in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and associated source data."

To test for formal dissociations, we directly compared the neural correlates of instructed and feedback-driven aversive learning in Instructed Group participants, who were exposed to both instructions and experiential learning. This within-subjects analysis ensures that potential dissociations indicated above are driven by differences in the computational sources of neural activation, rather than differences in performance between the groups. To isolate brain responses that were sensitive only to reinforcement (despite the presence of instructions about contingencies and reversals), we used the feedback-driven EV regressor generated from the model fit to the Uninstructed Group\u2019s behavior, which takes advantage of the fact that trial sequences were identical for both groups. The instruction-driven EV regressor was generated from the model fit to the Instructed Group\u2019s behavior and reported above."

Between reversals, experiential learning would be somewhat correlated across models. Thus, to remove shared variance, we did not orthogonalize regressors in this analysis (see Materials and Methods). A contrast across the two EV regressors formally tests whether each voxel is more related to feedback-driven or instruction-driven EV. Results from this contrast are presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. Voxelwise FDR-corrected analyses revealed that the bilateral amygdala was preferentially correlated with feedback-driven EV, while the right caudate and left putamen showed preferential correlations with instruction-based EV (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1\u2014source data 1</a>). ROI-based analyses confirmed voxelwise results, with a main effect of Region (F(2,40) = 3.76, p=0.0324; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), driven by amygdala correlations with feedback-driven EV but not instructed EV (t(1,19) = 2.57, p=0.0189), although striatal differences between models were not significant when averaged across the entire ROI. Although these effects were somewhat weak when limited to learners, effects increased in magnitude when we examined the entire Instructed Group, including individuals who did not exhibit measurable SCRs (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1\u2014source data 2</a>). When we included all Instructed Group participants, we also observed negative correlations with instruction-based EV in the VMPFC/OFC. ROI-wise analyses across the entire Instructed Group revealed that the main effect of Region (F(2, 60) = 7.12, p =0.0017) was driven by both bilateral amygdala specificity for feedback-driven EV (t(1,29) = 2.93, p =0.0066) as well as VMPFC/OFC specificity for instructed EV (t(1,29) = 2.29, p =0.0293)."

To further verify these dissociations with traditional contrast-based analyses that were independent of learning models and observed behavior, we employed a task-based, event-related General Linear Model (GLM). This allowed us to isolate the effects of instructed reversals within the Instructed Group by focusing specifically on the trials surrounding instructions, prior to subsequent reinforcement. The analysis leverages the delay between instruction delivery and US reinforcement (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and mirrors our behavioral analysis of the immediate effects of instructed reversals on SCR. We compared brain responses pre- and post-instruction by computing a CS ([previous CS+ &gt; previous CS-]) x Phase ([Pre - Post]) interaction analysis. This provided a within-subjects comparison between instructed reversals and feedback-driven reversals. Furthermore, this analysis is entirely independent of the Uninstructed Group, and therefore allows us to ensure that the results and conclusions reported above do not simply reflect a difference in performance or learning rate between the two groups."

Regions that are sensitive to instructions should show differential responses that reverse immediately upon instruction. The lavender timecourse depicts this pattern with greater activation on CS+ trials (blue) than CS- trials (yellow) prior to instruction, and the opposite pattern after instructions are delivered. Regions that update from aversive feedback and show no effect of instructed reversals would follow the orange timecourse, with greater activation to the previous CS+ than CS- both pre- and post-instruction. This feedback-driven pattern does not update until the new CS+ has been reinforced.\u00a0(<b>B</b>) A number of regions showed differential responses that reversed upon instruction, including the right VS and VMPFC/OFC (left; see also <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD8-data\">2</a>). The VS showed greater activation to the current CS+ relative to the current CS-, whereas the VMPFC/OFC showed deactivation to the CS+. The right amygdala showed differential activation that did not reverse with instructions (right). Additional regions that did not reverse with instructions are presented in <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD10-data\">2</a>. (<b>C</b>) We conducted brain-behavior correlations to explore the relationship between neural activity in the period surrounding instructions and the magnitude of each individual\u2019s behavioral response to instructions. We tested for correlations between each individual\u2019s \u03c1 parameter (based on within-subjects fits) and the magnitude of the reversal effect using an exploratory threshold of p&lt;0.001, uncorrected. We observed significant correlations between \u03c1 and the magnitude of instructed reversals in dACC (left) and the bilateral caudate tail and thalamus (right), as well as bilateral DLPFC (see <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that those individuals who showed stronger reversals in SCR also showed stronger reversals in these regions. In addition, we found that the individuals who showed the least evidence for updating with instructions also showed the largest non-reversing differential responses in the right amygdala (right).

The VMPFC/OFC was identified in both ROI-based and voxel-wise analyses, while the striatal activation was evident in voxel-wise analyses (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1\u2014source data 1</a>).

Instructed reversal effects in the striatum and VMPFC/OFC were stronger and more widespread when the entire Instructed Group was included in the analysis (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1\u2014source data 2</a>).

Voxel-wise analyses revealed that the right amygdala showed differential responses that did not reverse upon instruction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), although effects were not significant when averaged across the entire ROI. We note that we also observed a small cluster in the left putamen that did not reverse with instructions; however this region showed greater activation to the current CS- than CS+, unlike the robust ventral striatal activation observed in all of our other analyses, which reveal greater activation with higher likelihood of aversive outcomes.

Although no regions survived FDR-correction, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; middle frontal gyrus, peak voxel xyz = [-43 43 21]) showed greater activation across all trials in the Instructed Group at an uncorrected threshold of p&lt;0.001 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

We combined a between-groups design with experimentally manipulated instructions during aversive reversal learning, which allowed us to dissociate neural circuits that update with instructions from those that respond to reinforcement alone. Consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wilson, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Grings et al., 1973</a>), SCRs updated immediately with instructions. Neuroimaging analyses revealed dissociable effects of instructions on regions involved in affective learning, based on both quantitative models and traditional task-based analyses. Quantitative modeling in the Uninstructed Group revealed that in the absence of instructions, the amygdala, striatum, and VMPFC/OFC tracked feedback-driven expected value (EV), consistent with a large body of literature on the circuitry that underlies reinforcement learning across species. The amygdala also followed the same feedback-driven EV timecourse in the Instructed Group, suggesting that the amygdala learned from reinforcement history, irrespective of instructions. In contrast to the amygdala, responses in the striatum and VMPFC/OFC tracked learning-related responses that updated immediately with instruction in the Instructed Group. Finally, instructed reversals in the striatum and VMPFC/OFC correlated with the DLPFC response to instructions. Below, we discuss the implications of these findings, their relationship to previous work, and important outstanding questions."

When individuals are instructed about contingencies, the prefrontal cortex influences responses in the striatum (<a href=\"#bib19\">Doll et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2011a</a>), and VMPFC/OFC (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2011a</a>). Our results indicate that similar mechanisms drive instructed aversive learning: Striatal and VMPFC/OFC learning-related responses updated with instructions, and the strength of instructed reversals in these regions was correlated with the DLPFC response to instructions. The striatum and VMPFC/OFC make up a well-characterized network that supports error-based learning across both appetitive and aversive domains (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balleine and O'Doherty, 2010</a>). The VMPFC/OFC has been linked with expected value and reversal learning (<a href=\"#bib39\">Murray et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schiller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rudebeck et al., 2013</a>), and the striatum is known to play a critical role in error-based learning (<a href=\"#bib17\">Delgado et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Haber and Knutson, 2010</a>). While the striatum and VMPFC/OFC both updated with instructions, the valence of responses diverged: Striatal activation increased in anticipation of aversive outcomes, whereas the VMPFC/OFC deactivated. This is consistent with a large number of studies suggesting that the VMPFC/OFC represents a valenced outcome expectancy signal, which correlates positively with reward magnitude or the strength of appetitive outcomes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Montague and Berns, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rangel and Hare, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Grabenhorst and Rolls, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Clithero and Rangel, 2013</a>), and correlates negatively with the magnitude of aversive outcomes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schiller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Plassmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Atlas et al., 2014</a>). The signals in the striatum are also consistent with previous work showing responses predicting aversive outcomes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2011b</a>), although we note that we found a mixture of appetitive and aversive signals here, consistent with previous work (<a href=\"#bib54\">Seymour et al., 2005</a>)."

Instructed reversals in these regions were linked with effects of instructions on the DLPFC, consistent with findings in reward learning (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2011a</a>). The DLPFC has direct projections to the OFC (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yeterian et al., 2012</a>) and rostral striatum (<a href=\"#bib25\">Haber, 2006</a>), and is critical for rule maintenance, working memory, and cognitive control (<a href=\"#bib55\">Smith and Jonides, 1999</a>). One model of instructed reward learning posits that the DLPFC maintains instruction information and influences striatal processing through excitatory input (<a href=\"#bib19\">Doll et al., 2009</a>). Our work suggests that similar mechanisms may underlie aversive learning. Our findings are also related to previous work showing DLPFC involvement in fear conditioning in the context of contingency awareness (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carter et al., 2006</a>) and cognitive regulation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Delgado et al., 2008a</a>). Future studies should manipulate DLPFC (e.g. with transcranial magnetic stimulation) to test whether this region plays a causal role in the effect of instructions on associative learning in the striatum and VMPFC/OFC."

The amygdala responded dynamically to threats in the environment similarly in both groups and showed no evidence for updating with instructions. The idea that aversive learning involves a specialized threat detection mechanism that is less sensitive to cognitive factors is consistent with suggestions concerning the amygdala\u2019s central role in automatic threat detection and salience (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ohman and Mineka, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ohman, 2005</a>). Our findings are consistent with previous work indicating the amygdala shows differential responses during aversive learning irrespective of contingency awareness (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tabbert et al., 2011</a>), and likewise that patients with unilateral temporal lobectomies exhibit differential SCRs during fear conditioning when they make expectancy ratings (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coppens et al., 2009</a>). Thus, when arousal is elicited by explicit information (e.g. through instruction or conscious expectancy), differential SCRs seem to be mediated by pathways that bypass the amygdala. Our work specifically implicates the prefrontal cortex (VMPFC, DLPFC, and DMPFC), striatum, insula, dACC, and the PAG, as these regions all updated immediately with instructions, and have been linked with skin conductance in previous work (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boucsein, 2012</a>). Our results suggest that instructions can influence physiological arousal and responses in regions involved in pain and threat, consistent with previous work (<a href=\"#bib31\">Keltner et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Atlas et al., 2010</a>), but the amygdala seems to hold a specialized role in learning and responding as a function of aversive reinforcement history and attention-demanding stimuli in the environment."

Thus the amygdala might be more attuned to instructed threat in the absence of aversive reinforcement. Other studies (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jensen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tabbert et al., 2006</a>) paired instructions about contingencies with actual reinforcement, as we did here. A key distinction between our paradigm and these previous studies is that we focused on the effects of instruction in changing environments and examined dynamic learning-related responses, whereas other studies manipulated instructions in stable environments with fixed outcome probabilities, which precludes testing for dissociations in the dynamic computations that underlie instructed and feedback-driven learning."

We believe that the neural dissociations we identify here may reflect distinct signals with separable functions. In particular, previous work using fMRI, lesions, and electrophysiology indicates that much of the activity in VMPFC/OFC reflects the computation of expected value (<a href=\"#bib42\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Clithero and Rangel, 2013</a>). However, correlates of EV in amygdala and striatum may actually reflect two closely related quantities: associability (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pearce and Hall, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>) and PE (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bayer and Glimcher, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>), respectively. In the current task, associability and PE each behave similarly to EV in their trial-by-trial dynamics. This is because PE reflects the difference between the EV and the (infrequent) outcomes, and because (again due to the low reinforcement rate) associability modulates up or down in the same direction as EV in response to each outcome. The differences between these signals are largely unrelated to our primary question of interest \u2013 how any of these decision variables is affected by instructions \u2013 an observation that enabled us to use a single variable to compare signaling in all three areas and test for dissociations in the effects of instructions. Thus, we chose to model the signals with a common EV variable for simplicity and transparency, and to ensure that any apparent differences between the areas were not confounded by incidental differences or artifacts of orthogonalization that arose in the modeling of three largely similar signals. However we also considered the converse concern (i.e. that apparent differences in instruction sensitivity might spuriously arise due to the fact that we are using a generic EV timeseries as a stand-in for these other quantities). We verified this was not the case by testing the hybrid model (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pearce and Hall, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>). When we model associability and PE as separate variables from EV, we see substantially the same results, with feedback-driven associability signals supported by the amygdala in both groups, and striatal PEs that update with instruction (results not shown). Finally, returning to the question of the function of these areas, an amygdala associability signal might be uniquely impermeable to instructions because of its differential function. The role of associability in models is to monitor the reliability of outcomes in the world so as, in turn, to control the learning rate for separate experiential updating about predictions of those outcomes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pearce and Hall, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2011a</a>). This function may be necessarily experiential."

Though the vigilance of this system may benefit survival, it might also run awry in conditions characterized by persistent fear, such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. This might in turn underlie the critical role of experiential learning in successful therapy for these disorders. A better understanding of the neural and computational underpinnings of instructed aversive learning might elucidate mediating mechanisms and/or help produce more effectively targeted interventions for these disorders."

While many studies show potentially homologous responses in humans, primates, and rodents, distinctions have been noted (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wallis, 2011</a>). It is clear that the neural computations that support feedback-driven learning are highly conserved across species, and rely heavily on the striatum, amygdala, and VMPFC/OFC. Are the modulatory effects of verbal instructions similarly conserved? Our verbal instructions may recruit rule- and/or context-based modulatory mechanisms that operate similarly across mammalian species. For example, the strong influence of instructions on expected value coding in VMPFC/OFC may be consistent with the view that this region represents task state (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wilson et al., 2013</a>), which would update when individuals are told that contingencies change. The VMPFC/OFC has been shown to guide learning when value must be inferred (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jones et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Stalnaker et al., 2014</a>), and inferred value can also influence learning-related signals in the dopaminergic midbrain, striatum and habenula (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sadacca et al., 2016</a>). Likewise, rule-based processing in non-human primates is highly dependent on the prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib37\">Miller and Cohen, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wallis et al., 2001</a>), and might be linked to the instruction-based DLPFC modulation we observed here. Alternatively, it is possible that the instruction-based effects we have identified may depend on a unique human capacity for language. Future studies should combine context-based and feedback-driven reversals in other species to test for parallels with the dissociable learning systems we identify here."

We used linear mixed models to test whether participants showed differential responses to the CS+ relative to the CS-, whether these responses reversed, and whether the magnitude of these effects differed across groups. To do this, we created a matrix for each individual (First level analyses in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) that coded each trial as a function of Stimulus (Original CS+ versus Original CS-) and Reversal (Original contingencies versus Reversed contingencies). The Reversal regressor was coded relative to when instructions were delivered in the Instructed Group and relative to when the new context was reinforced in the Uninstructed Group (i.e. when subjects received a shock following the previous CS-). The linear mixed model evaluated trial-by-trial SCRs as a function of these two effects as well as their interaction. The Stimulus x Reversal interaction assesses the extent to which differential responses reverse, i.e. whether participants show greater SCRs to the current CS+ relative to the current CS-, irrespective of the actual stimulus. We also included a linear effect of time in the model to account for habituation, and an intercept for each subject. Group was coded at the second level, and we\u00a0tested whether the slopes of the individual effects or the intercept varied across groups."

First, we used a mixed effects model ('Across-subjects analysis'), wherein learning parameters were modeled as fixed parameters constant within each group but we allowed slopes to vary to compensate for variability across participants (<a href=\"#bib13\">Daw et al., 2006</a>). This offers a clear picture of group-level learning effects and provides clean estimates appropriate for modeling fMRI data (<a href=\"#bib14\">Daw, 2011</a>). We focus on these results in the main manuscript, and parameters from these models were used to create regressors for fMRI analyses. Second, we verified that the conclusions from these aggregate fits were consistent those from with more flexible (but noisier) estimates derived from an ensemble of individual fits to each subject\u2019s data separately ('Within-subjects analysis'). Results of within-subjects analyses were entirely consistent with across-subject analyses, and are provided in\u00a0<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>.

For each iteration of model fitting (i.e. test of a given parameter value) in Matlab\u2019s fminsearch.m program, candidate parameters were applied to each individual subject\u2019s trial order to generate a predicted timecourse of EV. For each participant, the resulting regressor was combined with an overall intercept. We used standard linear regression (through Matlab\u2019s glmfit.m function) to determine regression coefficients (based on minimizing the sum of squared errors), and then combined the regressors and the estimated coefficients to generate a predicted fit (using glmval.m). The predicted fit from each individual subject was concatenated with all other subjects to generate a group prediction, which was compared to the actual concatenated data, and aggregated residuals were used as a measure of goodness-of-fit, which were minimized over the course of ten iterations of fminsearch per model. This across-subjects approach, which estimates free parameters as fixed effects but allows slopes to vary, was used in order to avoid fixed effects model fitting (i.e. concatenating all data and treating observations as one large subject), which assumes all subjects show the same relationships with predictors and does not acknowledge that observations are nested within subjects."

First-level analyses employed the general linear model (GLM) in SPM8 without default implicit thresholding. We modeled cue onset and offset, and each EV regressor was included as a parametric modulator of the CS onset event. All events were convolved with a canonical gamma-variate hemodynamic response function (HRF). To evaluate the direct comparison between feedback-driven and instruction-driven EV within the Instructed Group, we disabled SPM\u2019s orthogonalization (in the functions spm_get_ons.m and spm_fMRI_design.m). This removes any shared variance between the two EV regressors without prioritizing one regressor over the other, which would otherwise be standard in SPM\u2019s default GLM approach when multiple regressors are included. In this analysis, we computed a second-level contrast within subjects to directly compare feedback-driven and instruction-driven EV, and contrast estimates were carried to the group level."

The VMPFC/OFC ROI was functionally defined, based on the deactivation to shock in the entire sample (peak voxel xyz = [-6 38 -16]).

We compared responses on these trials (new CS+ and new CS-) with responses with the same number of trials of each condition immediately prior to each reversal (previous CS+ and previous CS-). Thus we assessed a Stimulus ([Previous CS+ - Previous CS-]) x Reversal Phase ([Post \u2013 Pre]) interaction analysis. Our analysis collapsed across all three reversals at the first level. Thus regions that were identified as showing greater activation to the previous CS+ than CS- across pre- and post-reversal (i.e. Main Effect without interaction) were required to have updated over the course of the run (i.e. with reinforcement), as they had to show greater activation to the opposite contingencies by the time the next reversal was modeled. This model also coded the instruction events at the first level (10-second boxcar at the time of instructions). Beta estimates from this instruction period estimate were extracted from the DLPFC cluster identified in a between-groups comparison across all CS onset trials and correlated with the magnitude of instructed reversals in a whole-brain search."

It shows that learning from instructions can be dissociated from learning from experience both behaviourally and neurally. When the two learning-types conflict, the brain simultaneously contains estimates from both types of learning in different structures. The ventral prefrontal cortex (OFC, vmPFC) reflect the explicit knowledge derived from instructions, and the amygdala circuitry reflects the experientially derived estimates. The separate learning systems are shown both in a comparison between groups learning with and without explicit instructions, and demonstrated to exist in parallel within the instructed group. They appear to be strong and robust."

Models including a parameter to account for changes with instruction were fitted to SCR data. The results showed that instruction resulted in a remarkable improvement anticipating shock appropriately after the correct cue, both immediately after reversal and across the block. Both groups also showed a slower, presumably reinforcement mediated change in anticipating shock. The latter correlated best with signal in amygdala while the former was best related to activity in orbitofrontal cortex. Overall the study is brilliant, presenting a simple straightforward approach to the critical question of how higher order knowledge impacts underlying reinforcement learning mechanisms. The results are enticing because they fit well with some of our preconceived notions of how the systems may work but they also I think suggest some provocative overlap in the two theoretically dissociated systems. I especially like the identification of the amygdala as not responsive as I think this fits well with other data. I have a couple questions and suggestions which I think reflect less issues than places where I think the authors might extend or broaden the impact of their study, either by making more clear some of the more subtle results or by applying their idea more broadly."

In these studies, the SCR and amygdala is shown to correlate with the 'associability'.

These results are entirely consistent with the conclusions we make here, as both models reveal that instructions update learning in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex, but not the amygdala. However, the current model allows for direct tests of dissociations. We now discuss the fact that expected value reflects the joint combination of learning rate and prediction error, and that dynamic learning models may provide fine-grained tests of the precise computations that underlie the dissociations we see here, and we summarize findings from this alternative approach and explain the relationship with the more parsimonious model we report here (Discussion)."

However, the hybrid model decouples these quantities due to the time-varying learning rate. As noted above, when we compare instructed and feedback-driven variants of the hybrid model, we observe feedback-driven PEs in the Uninstructed Group, and these update with instructions in the Instructed Group. We now discuss these findings in the Discussion, although we opted not to include these results in the manuscript in the interest of simplicity."

We now report this explicitly in the subsection \u201cInstructions influence skin conductance responses\u201d. The reviewer points out that this weak behavior also leads to minimal impact of reversals in our feedback-driven model, although we do note that there are reversals evident in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, and that these effects may be magnified dependent on the coefficient when the model is fit to behavior. Reversals may be somewhat better captured by the hybrid model, as this allows learning rates to vary dynamically and associability increases when contingencies change. Since results of the hybrid model were highly consistent with the results of the simplified model we present here, we do not feel that the slow reversals substantively influenced our conclusions."

Instead we mean that there is a single dissociation between regions that update with instruction (orbitofrontal cortex and striatum) and those that do not (the amygdala).

Our findings are consistent with many fMRI studies of fear, pain, and aversive learning, which show deactivation in this region in anticipation of, and in response to, aversive outcomes. This can be understood in terms of a valenced value-coding function, such that the region shows increased activation in expectation of increasing rewards (positive correlation with positive expected value), and likewise, is negatively correlated with the magnitude of aversive outcomes. We have clarified the valenced BOLD signals and relationship to the literature on aversive learning in the second paragraph of the Discussion."

Of course, we feel that it would be premature to assert that our findings reflect a general mechanism conserved across species on the basis of the single study presented here, but we now explicitly acknowledge the question of whether these mechanisms translate across species in the Abstract, Introduction (first paragraph) and Discussion. We hope this expanded discussion will encourage researchers working on related questions in non-human primates and/or other species, as we are quite excited about the possibility of developing related paradigms to test for parallel dissociations in animal models, and we do think the literature is promising with respect to this possibility."
