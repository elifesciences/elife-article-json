In this study, we show that in budding yeast, the decision of cell cycle commitment (Start) is determined by the time integration of its triggering signal Cln3. We further identify the Start repressor, Whi5, as the integrator. The instantaneous kinase activity of Cln3-Cdk1 is recorded over time on the phosphorylated Whi5, and the decision is made only when phosphorylated Whi5 reaches a threshold. Cells adjust the threshold by modulating Whi5 concentration in different nutrient conditions to coordinate growth and division. Our work shows that the strategy of signal integration, which was previously found in decision-making behaviors of animals, is adopted at the cellular level to reduce noise and minimize uncertainty."

In this study, we show that in budding yeast, the decision of cell cycle commitment (Start) is determined by the time integration of its triggering signal Cln3. We further identify the Start repressor, Whi5, as the integrator. The instantaneous kinase activity of Cln3-Cdk1 is recorded over time on the phosphorylated Whi5, and the decision is made only when phosphorylated Whi5 reaches a threshold. Cells adjust the threshold by modulating Whi5 concentration in different nutrient conditions to coordinate growth and division. Our work shows that the strategy of signal integration, which was previously found in decision-making behaviors of animals, is adopted at the cellular level to reduce noise and minimize uncertainty."

However, little is known about how cells utilize the information of the input signal to make robust and reliable decisions especially in cases of noisy and time-varying signals. We address this issue by using the Start transition in budding yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) as a model system. Start is a major cell cycle checkpoint in budding yeast (corresponding to the restriction point in mammalian cells), which decides whether or not the cell should make the irreversible commitment to the next round of division (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hartwell et al., 1974</a>). The environmental and internal conditions are sensed and passed to the Start signal Cln3 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gallego et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Polymenis and Schmidt, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hall et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Parviz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Menoyo et al., 2013</a>). As a G1 cyclin, Cln3 triggers the Start transition by activating a downstream positive feedback loop composed of the repressor Whi5, the transcription factor SBF/MBF and the cyclin Cln1/2 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Skotheim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Charvin et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> upper panel). The Start checkpoint coordinates cell growth and cell division and is thought to control the cell size under different growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Johnston et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004</a>). However, the mechanisms of the coordination and control have not been fully elucidated."

The G1 length <i>T</i><sub><i>G1</i></sub> is defined as the time interval between Whi5 nuclear entry in late mitosis and its exclusion from the nucleus at the Start transition (<a href=\"#bib51\">Taberner et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which is a measure for how long the cell waits to make the Start decision. Cln3 level under a synthetic inducible promoter <i>GlacSpr</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) was controlled by titrating the inducer IPTG. The cells were grown in a microfluidic chip and monitored by time-lapse microscopy. We found that in both mother and daughter cells G1 length is prolonged as IPTG concentration decreases, which is consistent with the previous findings that increased Cln3 dosage shortens G1 length (<a href=\"#bib13\">Di Talia et al., 2007</a>) and suggests a negative correlation between G1 length and Cln3 level (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

To better quantitate the observed negative correlation between G1 length and Cln3 level, we screened for Cln3 mutants with lower activity and longer half-life based on a homolog modeling of the Cln3-Cdk1 complex (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Lower activity requires higher Cln3 concentration to pass Start and longer half-life allows more fluorescent proteins to mature before the tagged Cln3 is degraded, thus making the mutant Cln3 detectable in single cells. The fluorescent intensity and CDK activity of the GFP-GFP-Cln3 mutants were carefully examined. The desired mutants should fulfill three criteria: 1) the fluorescent brightness of the mutant can be quantitatively measured; 2) under full induction, the mutant can rescue the physiological function of the endogenous Cln3 in <i>cln3\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>); 3) the cell cycle of <i>cln3\u0394 bck2\u0394</i> strain can be arrested when the mutant is shut off. Two successful mutants, <i>CLN3R108A</i> and <i>CLN3D166A</i>, were obtained from the screening. Since the fully induced mutants do not change cell cycle behaviors such as the doubling time and cell size, we consider them faithful replacements of wild-type <i>CLN3</i> under our experimental conditions. Unless otherwise specified, the mutant <i>CLN3R108A</i> (denoted <i>CLN3*</i>) was used in following experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> lower panel and D). Interestingly, we found that under full induction, the nuclear concentration of GFP-GFP-Cln3* is positively correlated and G1 length is negatively correlated with birth size (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), which implies that size control is maintained with the mutant Cln3 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Di Talia et al., 2007</a>). It was proposed that Cln3 responds to size through the upstream open reading frame (uORF) of its mRNA (<a href=\"#bib42\">Polymenis and Schmidt, 1997</a>) and/or ER-associated proteins Whi3 and Ydj1 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Verg\u00e9s et al., 2007</a>). However, in our construct, the 5\u2032 leader of Cln3 mRNA was removed, and we did not observe any ER-like localization of Cln3 protein. The promoter activity does not correlate with size either (data not shown). The result suggests that there may be other regulation mechanism coupling Cln3 concentration to cell size. When the inducible promoter is repressed to different extent by reducing IPTG concentration, the correlation between Cln3 concentration and cell size is disrupted and promoter activity becomes the dominant controller of Cln3 concentration. In this work, we leave the question of how Cln3 is coupled to size and focus on how Start transition is triggered by a controllable Cln3 concentration."

In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>, we plot G1 length vs the average Cln3 in G1 for many single cells. The data shows an inverse-like correlation. Similar results were obtained when mother\u2013daughter cell types were distinguished, <i>CLN3D166A</i> was used as the signal, or G1 length is defined by the MCM marker (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liku et al., 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s6 fig1s7 fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6\u20138</a>).

Most parameters in the model were derived from published papers (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Due to the low abundance and short half-life, the Cln3 profile fluctuates considerably (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We compared two hypothetical models of Start triggering: the Instantaneous Model in which the Start transition is triggered once the Cln3 level reaches a certain threshold, and the Integration Model in which the Start is triggered once the integration of Cln3 level over time reaches a certain threshold (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The Instantaneous Model leads to a large variability in G1 length even in identical cells (no extrinsic noise from cell-to-cell variability) and under a constant environment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). When extrinsic noise is added in the model, the G1 variability of the Instantaneous Model is as large as 92%, which is significantly larger than experimental observations for WT cells in previous and this studies (<a href=\"#bib13\">Di Talia et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Skotheim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Charvin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</a>) (CVs are no more than 50%, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In contrast, since the G1 length in the Integration Model depends on the integration of Cln3 level within a time window, a considerable amount of noise is averaged out. As a result, the variability in G1 length is much smaller (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>) and is consistent with the experimental data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Furthermore, the shape of the G1 length distribution generated by the Integration Model is more similar to that of the experimental data. While the Instantaneous Model leads to a G1 length distribution with a long tail; this means that a significant fraction of the cells would have prolonged G1 lengths, which could be disadvantageous for the population. The conclusion holds the same when considering the nuclear volume increase during cell growth (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and using a wide range of parameters."

We next proceeded to identify the integrator, that is, on what molecule this kinase activity is being accumulated. The Start network is composed of two modules: Cln3-Cdk1 phosphorylating Whi5 as the triggering module and the positive feedback loop as the switching module (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The two modules are coupled via Whi5. The triggering module initiates Start by reducing Whi5 concentration in the nucleus. The switching module sets a threshold for the nuclear Whi5 concentration, <i>Whi5</i><sub><i>c</i></sub>, below which the switch will be flipped. Thus, G1 length is the time needed for the nuclear Whi5 concentration to drop below <i>Whi5</i><sub><i>c</i></sub>. We constructed a mathematical model for the kinetics of Whi5 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>).

Thus, we measured Whi5 nuclear entry right after G1 by inhibiting Cdk1 activity with a strain bearing a <i>cdc28-as1</i> allele (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bishop et al., 2000</a>). The average half time of Whi5 nuclear entry, which is an estimate of the memory length in the mathematical model (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>), is 13.7 min in mother cells and 10.6 min in daughter cells, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Note that this memory length is comparable to the average G1 length (from cytokinesis to Start) in daughter cells in SD medium, which is 13.6 min in our experiment. In poor nutrient conditions, when G1 length is prolonged, Whi5 dephosphorylation rate and the memory length might be further adjusted."

The first is that there is a linear relation between the integration threshold <i>A</i> and the total Whi5 concentration <i>Whi5</i><sub><i>tot</i></sub> (a more detailed ODE model predicts that <i>Cln3</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> will also change with <i>Whi5</i><sub><i>tot</i></sub> [<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>]).

Note that Cln3 half-life by itself has no effect on the integration dynamics; and that reducing the Cln3-Cdk1 catalytic efficiency <i>k</i><sub><i>1</i></sub> (as in Cln3*) increases <i>Cln3</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> and <i>A</i> proportionally, requiring an increased Cln3 concentration to pass Start."

                                "text": "We verified the model's predictions by perturbing the Start network. First, the integration effect would have difficulty to manifest itself without the integrator. Indeed, our experiment shows that in <i>whi5\u0394</i> strain, most cells pass Start with minimal G1 length (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We further checked to what extent the inverse correlation holds by plotting G1 length and Cln3 intensity in log\u2013log scale (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The slope of the linear fit is much larger than \u22121, suggesting that the inverse proportionality is severely compromised. Second, the integration threshold <i>A</i> should increase with the total Whi5 concentration. This means that at the same Cln3 concentration cell waits longer time in G1 with higher Whi5 dosage. The prediction is consistent with the previous finding that Whi5 overexpression significantly increased the percentage of the cells in G1 phase (<a href=\"#bib11\">Costanzo et al., 2004</a>). We quantitatively verified the effect of the total Whi5 concentration on the integration threshold <i>A</i> with a strain containing two copies of <i>WHI5</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The inverse correlation shifts upward in log\u2013log scale, which represents larger <i>A</i>. Remarkably, the positive correlation between <i>A</i> and Whi5 concentration can also be seen at the single-cell level (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.53, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In Cln3-<i>T</i><sub><i>G1</i></sub> correlations, the variation of G1 is high when Cln3 concentration is low. At least part of the variation is due to the variance in <i>Whi5</i><sub><i>tot</i></sub> concentration (and thus the variance in <i>A</i>). After normalizing by <i>Whi5</i><sub><i>tot</i></sub>, inverse correlations in both <i>1X</i> and <i>2X WHI5</i> strains are more converged and collapse to the same curve (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Third, the model predicts that increasing the phosphatase activity will not only increase <i>Cln3</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> but also cause deviation from the inverse correlation by shortening the memory length. It is known that overexpressing the phosphatase <i>CDC14</i> affects the nuclear accumulation of Whi5 and increases the percentage of the cells in G1 phase (<a href=\"#bib58\">Visintin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stevenson et al., 2001</a>). Thus, we tested the prediction in a <i>CDC14</i> overexpressing strain. We observed that <i>Cln3</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> increases and the inverse proportionality is compromised (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Finally, the model predicts that weakening the strength of the positive feedback loop will both reduce <i>Whi5</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> (thus increase <i>A</i>) and increase <i>Cln3</i><sub><i>c</i></sub>. We measured G1 length vs Cln3 intensity in <i>cln1\u0394</i> and <i>cln2\u0394</i> strains and observed that <i>Cln3</i><sub><i>c</i></sub>s increase and the inverse correlations shift upward in log\u2013log scale as predicted (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). The correlation in <i>cln2\u0394</i> shifts more than in <i>cln1\u0394</i>, suggesting that Cln2 contributes more to the positive feedback loop. This is consistent with the fact that the expression level of Cln2 is about three times higher than Cln1 and with the previous finding that Cln2 is more potent in the Start transition (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huh et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tyers and Futcher, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tyers et al., 1993</a>)."

Under different nutrient conditions, cells spend different time growing in G1 before passing Start (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</a>). However, it is not clear how this coordination is achieved. In light of our findings (<a href=\"#equ5\">Equation (5)</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>), it is suggestive that the cell could modulate the integration threshold <i>A</i>, and thus the G1 length, by tuning <i>Whi5</i><sub><i>tot</i></sub>.

A decision-making process in a cell usually consists of (i) sensing (of external and/or internal signals and cues), (ii) information processing (of the sensed information), and (iii) actuating (e.g., turning on a switch). Previous works have been mainly focused on the first and the last steps. Even in many cases where the molecular players and the circuitry are mapped out, how cells process information to make the best decision is largely unknown. This is intrinsically a quantitative question and is especially important when the signals are noisy and with uncertainties. Information processing is the brain of decision making; understanding this step is critical to understand the rationale and the strategy the cell adopts to make better decisions."

Using a quantitative single cell assay with a controllable and quantifiable Cln3 signal, we discovered that it is not the instantaneous value of the Cln3 concentration, but rather the integration of the concentration over time, that triggers the switch. Cln3 is a sensor that senses, with a fast response time, the instant information/condition relevant to making cell cycle commitment. We found that the instant Cln3 activity is memorized on phosphorylated Whi5, and the memory length is about 10 min in SD medium. This implies that the cell uses information within a time window of the past in order to get an assessment of the future."

Previous studies on size control were more focused on Cln3's response to environmental changes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gallego et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Polymenis and Schmidt, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hall et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Parviz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004</a>). It was proposed that the Start threshold is lowered in poor nutrient conditions, based on the conventional (instantaneous) model and the observation that the abundance of Cln3 is lower in these conditions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schneider et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Turner et al., 2012</a>). However, our finding on Whi5 modulation reveals a different scenario \u2013 the Start threshold is in fact raised in poor nutrients and the longer G1 length is a result of a longer integration time of Cln3. Cell cycle is coupled to growth rate by both Cln3 and Whi5. A full understanding of size control may need to take into account the combined action of Cln3 dynamics, <i>Whi5</i><sub><i>tot</i></sub> concentration and the integration mechanism."

Export of the fluorescent intensities and cell area was automatically accomplished by <i>cellseg</i> with minor revision. Following analysis was accomplished by the MATLAB custom software <i>analyzestart</i>, which was developed before (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lau, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yang et al., 2013</a>) and modified for the purpose of this study.

In our experimental setup, Cln3 level during G1 in one cell fluctuates with about 20% CV (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Author response image 1A</a>). If the Instantaneous Model were true, cells should pass Start at or near the peak of Cln3 profile. However, we found that in near 80% cells, the timing of Cln3 peak is different from the timing of Start (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Author response image 1B</a>). Even when we relax the timing requirement of the two events to be within 10 min, there are still over 50% cells that failed the test. The result is even more significant when focusing on G1 lengths longer than 30 min (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Author response image 1C</a>). It is thus very unlikely that Start is triggered by the instantaneous Cln3 concentration. We added this result as <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a> and a corresponding explanation in the main text. A major difference between the Instantaneous Model and the Integration Model is the memory length. The two models are equivalent in the limit of zero memory. We estimated the memory length to be over 10 min (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 3</a>), comparable to the G1 length in daughter cells (See the next response)."

To better understand the integration mechanism, we measured Whi5 dephosphorylation kinetics as the referees suggested. As most Whi5 is dephosphorylated and resides in the nucleus during G1 phase, we could not directly measure Whi5 dephosphorylation in G1. Thus we measured Whi5 nuclear entry right after G1 by inhibiting Cdk1 activity with a strain bearing a <i>cdc28-as1</i> allele. The average half time of Whi5 nuclear entry, which corresponds to the memory length in the mathematical model, is 13.7 min in mother cells and 10.6 min in daughter cells, respectively. Note that the average G1 length (from cytokinesis to Start) in daughter cells is 13.6 min in SD medium, a memory length of about 10 min should be long enough for the cell to take the advantage of integration."
