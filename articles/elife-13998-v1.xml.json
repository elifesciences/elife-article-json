It remains, however, unclear whether neuronal diversity, intricate tissue architecture, and axonal connectivity can be regenerated; yet, this is critical for recovery of function and a central aim of cell replacement strategies in the mammalian central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that, upon mechanical injury to the adult pallium, axolotls can regenerate several of the populations of neurons present before injury. Notably, regenerated neurons acquire functional electrophysiological traits and respond appropriately to afferent inputs. Despite the ability to regenerate specific, molecularly-defined neuronal subtypes, we also uncovered previously unappreciated limitations by showing that newborn neurons organize within altered tissue architecture and fail to re-establish the long-distance axonal tracts and circuit physiology present before injury. The data provide a direct demonstration that diverse, electrophysiologically functional neurons can be regenerated in axolotls, but challenge prior assumptions of functional brain repair in regenerative species."

It remains, however, unclear whether neuronal diversity, intricate tissue architecture, and axonal connectivity can be regenerated; yet, this is critical for recovery of function and a central aim of cell replacement strategies in the mammalian central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that, upon mechanical injury to the adult pallium, axolotls can regenerate several of the populations of neurons present before injury. Notably, regenerated neurons acquire functional electrophysiological traits and respond appropriately to afferent inputs. Despite the ability to regenerate specific, molecularly-defined neuronal subtypes, we also uncovered previously unappreciated limitations by showing that newborn neurons organize within altered tissue architecture and fail to re-establish the long-distance axonal tracts and circuit physiology present before injury. The data provide a direct demonstration that diverse, electrophysiologically functional neurons can be regenerated in axolotls, but challenge prior assumptions of functional brain repair in regenerative species."

Among these, urodele amphibians like the axolotl (<i>Ambystoma mexicanum)</i> are endowed with the capacity to add new neurons to the brain throughout life (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maden et al., 2013</a>) and can regenerate the spinal cord and parts of the brain after mechanical injury (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burr, 1916</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kirsche and Kirsche, 1964a</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Butler and Ward, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Piatt, 1955</a>). Resection of the middle one-third of one hemisphere, but not the whole hemisphere, in the axolotl telencephalon results in reconstruction of the injured hemisphere to a similar length as the contralateral, uninjured side (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kirsche and Kirsche, 1964a</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kirsche and Kirsche, 1964b</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Winkelmann and Winkelmann, 1970</a>). Similarly, after mechanical excision of the newt optic tectum, new tissue fills the space produced by injury (<a href=\"#bib35\">Okamoto et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, in the newt, selective chemical ablation of dopaminergic neurons within a largely intact midbrain triggers regeneration of the ablated pool of neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Parish et al., 2007</a>). In addition to urodeles, teleost fish have also been extensively studied for their capacity to regenerate the CNS and have led to the identification of some of the molecular signals involved in the regenerative process (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kizil et al., 2012</a>). These studies highlight the value of regenerative organisms as models to understand the mechanisms that govern brain regeneration for possible application to the mammalian brain."

Disruption of brain structure, connectivity, and neuronal composition is often associated with behavioral deficits, as observed in models of neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disease. It is therefore likely that functional regeneration of higher-order CNS structures will entail the regeneration of a great diversity of neuronal subtypes, the rebuilding of original connectivity, and the synaptic integration of newborn neurons in the pre-existing tissue. It is not known to what extent even regenerative species can accomplish these complex tasks, beyond their broad ability to generate new neurons and to rebuild gross brain morphology. It remains therefore debated whether any vertebrates are capable of true functional brain regeneration."

In addition, while the evolutionary origin of the mammalian cerebral cortex remains controversial (<a href=\"#bib29\">Moln\u00e1r, 2011</a>), it is likely that the axolotl pallium contains a basic representation of several of the neuronal subtypes found in the mammalian cerebral cortex and thus may serve as a good model for investigating regeneration of neuronal heterogeneity and complex circuit function."

We selected 19 genes that, in the mouse, are known to mark specific subtypes of either excitatory pyramidal neurons or inhibitory interneurons of the cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) and performed in situ hybridization on coronal sections of the adult axolotl brain, using riboprobes designed on axolotl cDNA sequences. Among all markers tested, expression of nine genes could be detected reliably in the axolotl pallium: <i>ctip2, satb2, tle4, rorb, er81, fezf2, gad2, sst,</i> and <i>calb2</i>. In the mouse neocortex, <i>Fezf2</i> and <i>Ctip2</i> are specifically expressed by subcerebral projection neurons (ScPNs) in layer Vb at high levels and by corticothalamic projection neurons (CThPNs) in layer VI at low levels (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arlotta et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Molyneaux et al., 2005</a>).

It is therefore not possible to conclude whether some of the neurons in the regenerate are newborn (yet not labeled by BrdU) or are endogenous neurons that have migrated from neighboring territories. If migration of neurons into the injured region were a major contributor to the regenerative process, this could cause a decrease in the number of certain neuronal subtypes in regions adjacent to the injury site. We thus quantified the number of neuronal subtypes in MP and LP. We found no significant differences between contralateral, injured, and sham hemispheres for any of the neuronal subtype markers tested (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting, albeit not fully excluding, the possibility that no major waves of migration of endogenous neurons reconstitute neuronal diversity in the regenerated dorsal pallium."

Upon metamorphosis, we injured the dorsal pallium of post-metamorphosis axolotls and found that morphological regeneration takes place within a similar time frame as the pre-metamorphosis axolotls (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The sum of DI from four consecutive sections spanning the injury site was taken for each group. In uninjured animals, bin 3 is mostly populated by neuronal processes and does not contain cell bodies. In agreement, we found that virtually no NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons are present within this bin in the contralateral and sham hemispheres. However, in the regenerated pallium at 11wpi, we consistently found neurons in bin 3 (Contra n=7 DI 19.46 \u00b1 3.272; Injured n=7 DI 212.4 \u00b1 65.85; Sham n=5 DI 22.95 \u00b1 8.508), indicating that the radial organization of neurons in the dorsal pallium at 11wpi is disrupted compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013b</a>).

These results indicate that, beyond instructing the birth of new neurons, the adult axolotl brain is capable of regenerating a diversity of neurons that in turn are electrophysiologically functional, even when a large region of the brain is removed."

It is similarly unknown whether tissue architecture and neuronal topography can be regenerated. We found that axolotls possess only limited capacity to rebuild original tissue architecture after large deletions of the pallium. In addition, we uncovered an unexpected limitation to the capacity of newborn neurons to extend axons to original targets in distal brain regions. It is possible that the observed limitations relate to a lack of instructive signals from the environment rather than intrinsic limitations of the regenerated neurons. For example, in order to reach the OB, newborn neurons of the pallium will have to extend axons through uninjured territory that may lack developmental ligands necessary for axon guidance to the OB."

Using in vivo MRI, we were able to observe, for the first time, the dynamic changes in tissue morphology that occur in live animals over the course of brain regeneration. We found that early steps of wound closure involve the generation of thinner processes from a stump that directionally grow towards each other before fusing. This strategy resembles that observed in the limb, in which closure of the wound by the wound epithelium after amputation is necessary for subsequent regenerative steps and may serve as a source of signals to govern downstream regenerative events (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mescher, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Thornton, 1957</a>). It is possible that, much like the limb, morphogenetic movements act as a signaling event to trigger cellular proliferation and accumulation of newborn, differentiated cells at the site of injury. In support of this possibility, we did not observe major waves of neuronal migration from regions adjacent to the injury site, and the topography of neurons in these regions remains properly organized upon regeneration. In the future, it will be interesting to determine the cellular source of the newborn neurons. Activated ependymoglia cells are one of the major sources of injury-induced newborn neurons in the newt and zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kroehne et al., 2011</a>), and these cells may similarly be the main origin of newborn neurons in the axolotl pallium. An alternative, yet not exclusive, possibility is that reprogramming of endogenous differentiated cells may contribute to the generation of new neurons. Such reprogramming events were reported, for example, in the zebrafish retina, where Mueller glia appears capable of generating new neurons upon retinal injury (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernardos et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ramachandran et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Thummel et al., 2008</a>)."

This should help define concrete goals and expectations for cellular replacement outcomes in the central nervous system of mammals."

In this report, the authors investigate the extent to which the brain, specifically the pallium, of the adult axolotl can regenerate its neuronal types, their tissue organization, electrical properties and connectivity in response to mechanical injury. For this, they first characterize the diversity of the neurons in the normal pallium based on the in situ expression of a set of nine molecular markers known to label pyramidal neurons or interneurons in mouse. As in mouse, these markers label neurons in a regionalized manner in the axolotl pallium implying a map-like organization of diverse, molecularly defined neuron types in the pallium."

Molecular marker studies using 4 of the previously mapped labels together with cell counts in the regenerated pallium indicate that at least a subset of the molecularly distinct neuronal subtypes in the pallium are regenerated and that their number is comparable to that of controls. Further electrophysiological studies indicate that the regenerated neurons have passive and active membrane properties and also manifest spontaneous postsynaptic currents comparable to controls. Thus in these molecular and physiological respects, the regenerated neurons resemble control neurons."

Thus, the radial organization of neurons in the dorsal pallium is perturbed, molecularly defined neuronal types are mislocalized, and neuronal fibers manifest misprojection phenotypes. Moreover, long distance projections from the regenerated dorsal pallium to the olfactory bulb are strongly reduced (10% of control values) and the field population spikes in lateral and medial pallium were significantly decreased implying lack of input to these regions."

Accordingly, we have now removed all claims of neuronal integration from the text, and instead, we state that the newborn neurons receive afferent inputs, which is what the data demonstrates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>). In addition, to strengthen our claim that the newborn neurons acquire mature electrophysiological traits, we increased the number of neurons recorded from the injured brains. The overall claim still remains the same, but now has additional statistical power (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>). Additionally, to understand what types of receptors are involved in the synaptic transmission to the newborn neurons, we have added data that show elimination of the majority of sPSCs when treated with the AMPA receptor blocker, DNQX (now, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Immunohistochemistry against NeuN and Tle4, as well as in situ hybridization against <i>Rorb</i>, show that the topography of neurons and neuronal populations is properly organized in the injured lateral pallium at 11wpi, compared to controls (uninjured and contralateral). These results suggest that the neurons in the lateral pallium maintain the original organization, but no longer extend their axons to the olfactory bulb (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). One possible explanation for the lack of OB projections from the lateral pallium of injured (regenerated) brains is that this axonal tract may be severed upon injury to the dorsal pallium. The data thus far suggest that the wound closes first, followed by a process of amplification of cells (likely progenitors, but possibly other cell types) that occurs right at the injury side, before differentiation starts. We have now better discussed this possible model and compared it to the situation in the limb, where the wound epithelium closes and triggers generation of an underlying blastema."

Ependymoglia cells with radial glia-like morphology (and progenitor plasticity) are a likely source for regenerated neurons. However, differentiated endogenous cells of other types may also play a role. Answering this question will require generation of genetically modified axolotl Cre lines that reliably label only selected cell types and thus enable lineage fate mapping/tracing. We have now directly discussed this important point in the revised manuscript, highlighting also the intriguing possibility that reprogramming of endogenous, differentiated cells types (and not only progenitors) may be a possible source, as observed, for example, in the zebrafish retina."
