We term the signal from differentiating cells the 'equilibrium signal' in order to distinguish it from the 'niche signal'.  Earlier we showed that Equilibrium signaling utilizes Pvr (the <i>Drosophila</i> PDGF/VEGF receptor), STAT92E, and Adenosine deaminase-related growth factor A (ADGF-A) [1].  Little is known about how this signal initiates during hematopoietic development. To identify new genes involved in lymph gland blood progenitor maintenance, particularly those involved in equilibrium signaling, we performed a genetic screen that identified <i>bip1</i> (<i>bric \u00e0 brac interacting protein 1</i>) and <i>Nucleoporin 98</i> (<i>Nup98</i>) as additional regulators of the  equilibrium signal.  We show that the products of these genes along with the Bip1-interacting protein RpS8 (Ribosomal protein S8) are required for the proper expression of Pvr."
