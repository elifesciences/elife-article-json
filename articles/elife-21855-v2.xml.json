Here, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic flow and matrix organization interact to shape competitive dynamics in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> biofilms. Irrespective of initial frequency, in competition with matrix mutants, wild-type cells always increase in relative abundance in planar microfluidic devices under simple flow regimes. By contrast, in microenvironments with complex, irregular flow profiles \u2013 which are common in natural environments \u2013 wild-type matrix-producing and isogenic non-producing strains can coexist. This result stems from local obstruction of flow by wild-type matrix producers, which generates regions of near-zero shear that allow matrix mutants to locally accumulate. Our findings connect the evolutionary stability of matrix production with the hydrodynamics and spatial structure of the surrounding environment, providing a potential explanation for the variation in biofilm matrix secretion observed among bacteria in natural environments."

Here, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic flow and matrix organization interact to shape competitive dynamics in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> biofilms. Irrespective of initial frequency, in competition with matrix mutants, wild-type cells always increase in relative abundance in planar microfluidic devices under simple flow regimes. By contrast, in microenvironments with complex, irregular flow profiles \u2013 which are common in natural environments \u2013 wild-type matrix-producing and isogenic non-producing strains can coexist. This result stems from local obstruction of flow by wild-type matrix producers, which generates regions of near-zero shear that allow matrix mutants to locally accumulate. Our findings connect the evolutionary stability of matrix production with the hydrodynamics and spatial structure of the surrounding environment, providing a potential explanation for the variation in biofilm matrix secretion observed among bacteria in natural environments."

These groups of bacteria are small-scale ecosystems in which cells cooperate and compete with one another to obtain resources, such as food and space to grow. Within a biofilm, a sticky glue-like substance called the matrix binds the cells to each other and to the surface. Cells that make the matrix typically have an advantage over those that do not because they can better resist the shearing forces experienced when liquid flows over the surface. The matrix also helps cells to capture nutrients from the passing liquid. Nevertheless, not all strains of bacteria make matrix, despite its advantages."

Nadell, Ricaurte et al. studied normal <i>P. aeruginosa</i> bacteria and a mutant strain that is unable to make matrix. The strains were labeled with fluorescent markers and put into special chambers that simulated different environments. The proportion of each strain was measured after three days of biofilm growth. When biofilms were grown under flowing liquid in simple environments with flat surfaces, matrix producers always outcompeted non-producers. However, the two strains coexisted in more complex and porous environments, like those found in soil."

In these regions, non-producing cells could compete successfully because resistance to shearing forces is less important when flow is weak or absent, and so the non-producing cells were not washed away. The results begin to explain why matrix production among cells in environmental settings is diverse and highlight that the environment is important in the evolution of bacterial biofilms."

The extracellular matrix defines biofilm structure, promotes cell-cell and cell-surface adhesion, and confers resistance to chemical and physical insults (<a href=\"#bib22\">Flemming and Wingender, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hobley et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Teschler et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Tseng et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Doroshenko et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Landry et al., 2006</a>). The matrix also plays a role in the social evolution and population dynamics of biofilm-dwelling bacteria (<a href=\"#bib59\">Nadell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Steenackers et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Nadell et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ghoul and Mitri, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Mitri et al., 2016</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">2011</a>). In some species, such as the soil bacterium <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, matrix materials are readily shared among cells, leading to public goods dilemmas in which non-producing strains can outcompete producing strains (<a href=\"#bib75\">van Gestel et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib76\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kov\u00e1cs, 2014</a>). In other species, including the pathogens <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>, and <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, matrix-secreting cell lineages privatize most matrix components, allowing them to smother or laterally displace other cell lineages and, in so doing, outcompete non-producing cells (<a href=\"#bib78\">Xavier and Foster, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Nadell and Bassler, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Nadell et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kim et al., 2014c</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Schluter et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Irie et al., 2016</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib14\">Drescher et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Yan et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Madsen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Oliveira et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, not all wild and clinical isolates of these species produce a biofilm matrix, despite the clear ecological and competitive benefits of possessing a matrix (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mann and Wozniak, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yawata et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chowdhury et al., 2016</a>). Theory and experiments investigating bacterial colonies on agar show that constrained movement can promote coexistence of different strains and species (<a href=\"#bib47\">Levin, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Levin and Paine, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Durrett and Levin, 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kerr et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Poltak and Cooper, 2011</a>). Fitness trade-offs between the benefits of being adhered to surfaces and the ability to disperse to new locations can cause variability in matrix production (<a href=\"#bib56\">Nadell and Bassler, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yawata et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Levin, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cohen and Levin, 1991</a>), but it is not well understood how selective forces within the biofilm environment itself might drive the coexistence of strains that make matrix with strains that do not. Here, we explore how selection for matrix production occurs within biofilms on different surface geometries and under different flow regimes, including those that are relevant inside host organisms and in abiotic environments such as soil."

We focused on Pel because it is the key structural polysaccharide in PA14 biofilms, and it is necessary for streamer formation under complex flow regimes. Deletion of <i>pelA</i> significantly impairs biofilm formation in PA14, which does not naturally produce Psl, an additional matrix polysaccharide secreted by other <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates (<a href=\"#bib10\">Colvin et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2011</a>). Wild-type cells produced GFP, and \u2206<i>pelA</i> mutants produced mCherry. Experiments in shaken liquid culture using genetically identical wild-type cells producing GFP or mCherry confirmed that fluorescent protein expression constructs had no measurable effect on growth rate (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our first goal was to compare the population dynamics of the wild-type and \u2206<i>pelA</i> strains in typical planar microfluidic devices, which have simple parabolic flow regimes, and in porous environments containing turns and corners, which have irregular flow profiles and better reflect the packed soil environments that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> often occupies (<a href=\"#bib28\">Green et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Das and Mukherjee, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Stover et al., 2000</a>). To approximate the latter environment, we used microfluidic chambers containing column obstacles. The size and spacing distributions of the column obstacles were specifically designed to simulate soil or sand (see Materials and methods). Analogous methods have been used previously to study bacterial growth (<a href=\"#bib77\">Vos et al., 2013</a>) and the behavior of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lockery et al., 2008</a>) in realistic environments while maintaining accessibility to microscopy. In our setup, flow was maintained through these chambers at rates comparable to those experienced by <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in a soil environment (<a href=\"#bib32\">Heath, 1983</a>)."

Most commonly, one would monitor biofilm co-cultures of wild-type and \u2206<i>pelA</i> PA14 cells over time until their strain compositions reached steady state. Performing such time-series experiments was not possible here due to a combination of low-fluorescence output in the early phases of biofilm growth coupled with phototoxicity incurred by cells during epifluorescence imaging. To circumvent this issue, we measured the change in frequency of wild-type and \u2206<i>pelA</i> cells over a fixed 72 hr time period as a function of their initial ratio in both planar chambers and soil-mimicking chambers containing column obstacles. Population composition was quantified in all cases using microscopy, as described in the Materials and methods section. From these measurements, we could infer the final stable states of Pel-producing and non-producing cells as a function of surface topography and flow conditions.

This result is consistent with recent studies of <i>V. cholerae</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. demonstrating that \u2013 in these species \u2013 core structural polysaccharides of the secreted matrix cannot be readily exploited by non-producing mutants (<a href=\"#bib56\">Nadell and Bassler, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Nadell et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kim et al., 2014c</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Schluter et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Irie et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Yan et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Madsen et al., 2015</a>). Confocal microscopy revealed that Pel-producers mostly excluded non-Pel-producing cells from biofilm clusters in planar chambers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), although some \u2206<i>pelA</i> mutants resided on the periphery of wild-type biofilms. The liquid effluent from these chambers contained an over-representation of the \u2206<i>pelA</i> mutant relative to wild type, consistent with the interpretation that \u2206<i>pelA</i> strain was displaced from the substratum over time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). When wild-type and \u2206<i>pelA</i> cells competed in microfluidic devices simulating porous microenvironments, by contrast, there was a pronounced shift to negative frequency-dependent selection for Pel production (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>). Wild-type PA14 was selectively favored at initial frequencies below\u00a0~0.6. Above this critical frequency, the \u2206<i>pelA</i> mutant was favored. From this result, we can infer that in this porous environment, \u2206<i>pelA</i> null mutants can grow and stably coexist with wild type Pel-producers."

In our experiments, streamers were produced by wild-type cells and could be readily detected via microscopy throughout column-containing chambers, but not planar chambers. Streamers are known to catch cells and debris that pass by (<a href=\"#bib16\">Drescher et al., 2013</a>), and although \u2206<i>pelA</i> cells could be found in the streamers in our experiments, they were not abundant. Cell capture by streamers therefore cannot account for the observed coexistence of the two strains (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result suggests that streamers do indeed catch debris, consistent with prior studies (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kim et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Drescher et al., 2013</a>), but that in our system, \u2206<i>pelA</i> cells are not present at high enough density in the passing liquid phase to accumulate substantial population sizes by this mechanism."

We hypothesized that partial clogging could render those portions of the chambers more suitable for growth of the \u2206<i>pelA</i> strain, which was previously shown to be sensitive to removal by shear (<a href=\"#bib10\">Colvin et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2011</a>). This hypothesis predicts that \u2206<i>pelA</i> cells should be found predominantly in regions of the chamber that have been clogged by wild type biofilms. To test this prediction, we repeated our co-culture competition experiment with wild-type and \u2206<i>pelA</i> cells in chambers containing columns, and we measured the distribution of each strain as above. We next introduced fluorescent beads into the chambers by connecting new influent syringes to the inflow tubing. By tracking the beads with high frame-rate microscopy, we could distinguish areas in which flow was present from areas in which flow was absent or very low, and then we could superimpose this information onto the spatial distributions of wild-type and \u2206<i>pelA</i> mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Importantly, and in support of our prediction, \u2206<i>pelA</i> biofilm clusters occurred significantly more often in regions in which flow was blocked by wild-type biofilms than in regions in which flow was not interrupted (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). As shown previously (<a href=\"#bib16\">Drescher et al., 2013</a>), \u2206<i>pelA</i> cells did not clog chambers when grown in isolation, supporting the interpretation that \u2206<i>pelA</i> accumulation relies on and only occurs after clogging by the wild type. This result is consistent with prior indications that Pel-producers have higher shear tolerance than Pel-deficient cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Colvin et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2011</a>), which we confirmed in our system by growing each strain in isolation under varying shear stress in planar chambers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Further supporting our interpretation, the \u2206<i>pelA</i> strain can outcompete the wild type when the two are grown together in planar microfluidic chambers in the absence of flow (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Here, we have shown that the clogging process can dramatically influence population dynamics within growing biofilms by generating a feedback between hydrodynamic flow, biofilm spatial architecture, and competition (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coyte et al., 2016</a>). Our findings suggest that when <i>P. aeruginosa</i> wild type and \u0394<i>pelA</i> mutants experience irregular flow in heterogeneous environments, wild-type biofilm formation causes partial clogging, regionally reducing local flow speed. The lack of flow generates favorable conditions for the \u2206<i>pelA</i> strain, whose biofilms would otherwise be removed by shear forces, presumably enabling it to proliferate locally if sufficient nutrients for growth diffuse from other areas of the chamber in which medium continues to flow (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bottero et al., 2013</a>)."

The size and spatial distributions of these column obstacles were determined by taking a cross-section through a simulated volume of packed beads mimicking a simple soil environment.

The following morning, aliquots of the overnight cultures were added to Eppendorf\u00a0(Hamburg,\u00a0Germany) tubes, and their optical densities were equalized prior to preparation of defined mixtures of wild-type and \u2206<i>pelA</i> cells. 100 \u00b5L volumes of the wild-type strain alone, the \u2206<i>pelA</i> strain alone, or mixtures of the two strains (for competition experiments), were introduced into microfluidic chambers using 1 mL syringes and Cole-Parmer (Vernon Hills, IL) polytetrafluoroethylene tubing (inner diameter\u00a0=\u00a00.30 mm; outer diameter\u00a0=\u00a00.76 mm). After 3 hr, fresh tubing connected to syringes containing fresh minimal M9 medium with 0.5% glucose were inserted into the inlet channels. The syringes (3 mL BD Syringe, 27G; Becton, Dickinson and Co.; Franklin Lakes, NJ) were mounted onto high-precision syringe pumps (Harvard Apparatus;\u00a0Holliston,\u00a0MA), which were used to tune flow speeds according to empirical measurements of flow speeds in soil (<a href=\"#bib32\">Heath, 1983</a>). In our experiments, the average flow speed was 150\u2013200 \u00b5m/s, unless noted otherwise. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, to alter shear, we varied the average flow speed; shear was estimated using standard calculations for surface shear stress under fluid flow: <math id=\"inf1\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi>\u03c4</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2202</mi><mi>u</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2202</mi><mi>y</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mtext>\u00a0</mtext><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow><mi>L</mi></mfrac><mtext>\u00a0</mtext><mfrac><mi>H</mi><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math> where <math id=\"inf2\"><mi>\u03c4</mi></math> is the shear stress, <math id=\"inf3\"><mi>y</mi></math> is the height above the surface (evaluated in this case for <math id=\"inf4\"><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>), <math id=\"inf5\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math> is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and <math id=\"inf6\"><mi>u</mi></math> is the fluid flow velocity field, calculated for a rectangular channel in terms of the pressure decrease <math id=\"inf7\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mi>p</mi><mrow><mo>/</mo></mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> across the length <i>L</i> and height <i>H</i> of the channel. The pressure decrease was calculated for our channel dimensions and flow rates using previously published results (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fuerstman et al., 2007</a>). Biofilms were grown at room temperature. It should be noted that microfluidic experiments in the obstacle-containing chambers experience a high failure rate, in which no biofilms appear to grow after the 72 hr period of the experiment. No data could be extracted from such chambers, which were omitted from analysis. This problem was overcome by performing the experiment at high replication. Sufficient data were thus collected to populate the relevant panels in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a> of the main text. In the case of competition experiments, one replicate was defined as the output from one independently inoculated microfluidic chamber (e.g. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). For experiments in which biofilm growth was measured as a function of flow-mediated shear stress (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), one replicate was defined as the output from one imaging location within a microfluidic chamber, with two to three locations per chamber being sampled."

To include heterogeneity in sphere size in our model, we adjusted each sphere\u2019s radius using uniformly distributed random numbers to generate a range of sphere radii varying from 0.4\u00a0to\u00a01.0. For a plane that is oblique to any of the symmetry planes defined by the centers of the spheres, we generated a cross-section through the 3D packed-sphere model. This cross-section of the spheres was used to define the borders of the columns in our soil-mimicking microfluidic devices. To convert the arbitrarily sized spheres from the 3D model to the actual sizes of physical columns in our microfluidic chambers, we chose column radii that varied from 80 to 200 \u03bcm, corresponding to particle sizes of fine- and medium-grain sand."

Minimal M9 medium with 0.5% glucose was introduced into the chambers for 72 hr as described above. The entire chamber was then imaged using widefield epifluorescence microscopy to document the locations of wild-type and \u2206<i>pelA</i> cell clusters. Subsequently, the influent syringes were replaced with syringes containing yellow-green fluorescent beads (sulfate-modified, diameter\u00a0=\u00a02 \u00b5m; Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) at a concentration of 0.3%, and bead suspensions were flowed into the microfluidic chambers. To determine the presence or absence of flow with respect to the spatial distributions of wild-type and \u2206<i>pelA</i> cells, and to obtain large images for statistics, the entire chamber was imaged with a 1 s exposure time, over which traveling beads were captured as streaks. It should be noted that this experiment also has a high failure rate due to the sensitivity of the microfluidic chambers to removal and re-insertion of syringes, and required optimization to execute successfully. Custom Matlab code was written to correlate the presence or absence of fluid flow with the accumulation of wild-type and \u2206<i>pelA</i> cells. In brief, the positions of the columns were first identified and used to divide the chamber into triangular sampling areas using a network structure in which columns served as nodes and straight lines between column centers served as edges. Within each sampling triangle, the area covered by columns was first removed, and subsequently, the averaged \u2206<i>pelA</i> and wild-type fluorescence intensities in the remaining area were used to determine if a region had wild type and/or \u2206<i>pelA</i> accumulation. In parallel, each sampling area was scored for the presence of flow in the corresponding bead tracking images (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The article studies the advantage of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> producing extracellular polymeric substances in different flow environments. By competing a wild-type producer strain with a non-producing mutant, the authors show that while the wild-type out-competes the mutant in an environment where flow is unobstructed, introducing barriers and creating an irregular flow environment can change these predictions to the advantage of the mutant, leading to co-existence. They argue that this is because shear is reduced in the complex environment, creating small pockets where the mutant can grow without being washed away."

While the dynamics of bacterial biofilms within porous environments has long been studied, how genotypes compete at the pore scale has largely been ignored. Previous work has largely focused on Darcy scale phenomena and lack clear mechanistic insights into the processes that shape community structure. The message of the paper is also important, since it shows that selection pressures in simplified environmental conditions in the lab may change in more complex environments. The data also nicely explain natural diversity in biofilm production phenotypes. Finally, the article is clear and well written. However, the reviewers have made a few recommendations that would greatly improve the manuscript."

Spatial structure has therefore previously been shown to foster strain co-existence in bacterial communities (e.g. Kerr et al. 2002 Nature, Kim et al. 2008 PNAS, Poltak & Cooper 2011 ISME Journal). The dynamics reported here are somewhat different, since previous studies were conducted in the absence of flow. Liquid flow changes the story substantially because fitness now depends on a strain's ability to stay put, and other secretions \u2013 which may be important public goods \u2013 are washed away. This social component and a clear comparison to previous literature is not well covered in the paper. The authors mention this aspect here and there, but do not clearly introduce the social principles. This should be changed."

Why does the fraction of WT cells decrease when they are inoculated at frequencies larger than 0.6 (even if the effect is not huge)? It seems that this could have many causes: measurements in liquid culture show that <i>pelA</i> cells do have a slightly larger growth rate than WT cells, but this difference was not statistically significant. Could the difference between the two genotypes be larger in a biofilm that is not exposed to flow (note the huge error bar in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)? Or perhaps the architecture of the WT biofilm in porous environments is somehow playing a role? It seems that the basic mechanism behind this observation are not discussed in the manuscript."

In this scenario, biofilm can form, but cells will not be washed away. Will the mutant grow as in liquid (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) or are there other advantages to biofilm growth? Will they grow even more relative to the wild-type than in liquid? The authors already show mono-culture data under this condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This would substantiate their claim in the conclusion that \"Pel non-producers do not appear to directly exploit the matrix material produced by wild type cells, but they can take advantage of the low-shear conditions that wild type matrix producers generate in complex flow environments\"."

Do the authors have an idea as to whether the cells trapped within these low velocity regions suffer from decreased reproductive fitness? The authors measured cells from the effluent in the flat microfluidic devices, is there a particular reason why similar observations could not be made in the porous channels?"

The dynamics reported here are somewhat different, since previous studies were conducted in the absence of flow. Liquid flow changes the story substantially because fitness now depends on a strain's ability to stay put, and other secretions \u2013 which may be important public goods \u2013 are washed away. This social component and a clear comparison to previous literature is not well covered in the paper.

It seems that this could have many causes: measurements in liquid culture show that pelA cells do have a slightly larger growth rate than WT cells, but this difference was not statistically significant. Could the difference between the two genotypes be larger in a biofilm that is not exposed to flow (note the huge error bar in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)?

The fact that Pel mutants can locally coexist with wild type cells in the complex flow environment, due to the clogging which reduces flow, whereas they cannot coexist with wild type in the simple flow environment, means by definition that Pel mutants have a higher reproductive fitness under complex flow conditions than they do under simple flow conditions. This result and its underlying causes are the core conclusions of our paper. Regarding nutrient status within flow-blocked areas, we note also that even though bulk transport of nutrients has been reduced or terminated, diffusion of nutrients from neighboring regions continues. Our experiments directly demonstrate that cells in the flow-blocked regions continue to grow."
