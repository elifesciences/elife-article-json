Over a period of 51 weeks players were able to match computational alignments of genetic sequences in 78% of cases, and to improve them in 15% of cases. We also found that most players were only transiently interested in the game, and that the majority of the work done was performed by a small group of dedicated players. Based on our experiences we have built a linear model for the length of time that contributors are likely to donate to a crowd-sourced citizen science project. This model could serve a guide for the design and implementation of future crowd-sourced citizen science initiatives."

Over a period of 51 weeks players were able to match computational alignments of genetic sequences in 78% of cases, and to improve them in 15% of cases. We also found that most players were only transiently interested in the game, and that the majority of the work done was performed by a small group of dedicated players. Based on our experiences we have built a linear model for the length of time that contributors are likely to donate to a crowd-sourced citizen science project. This model could serve a guide for the design and implementation of future crowd-sourced citizen science initiatives."

The process of alignment requires the best overall match between the two sequences to be found first: this \u2018global alignment\u2019 is then followed by a finer-grained \u2018local alignment\u2019 that involves modifying the short sequences by, for example, inserting small gaps or deleting short stretches of the sequence."

A straightforward measure is percent identity (in which the number of identical nucleotides in the alignment is calculated as a proportion of whole alignment length). Once the alignment process is complete, any differences between the two sequences can be considered a genetic variation. These differences can be single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in which a single nucleotide differs, or insertion\u2013deletion polymorphisms (INDELs), in which longer stretches are different. Software like SAMTools (<a href=\"#bib8\">Li et al., 2009</a>) can identify the variants from alignments."

The game presented the player with a pre-selected small section of genome sequence from the KW1 reference strain and rows of sequence from one of the other test variants (<a href=\"#bib10\">MacLean, 2013</a>), with each DNA sequence represented as a string of colored leaves. The game provided tools that allow the player to shift the sequence relative to the reference and to edit the sequence in such a way as to introduce deletions or gaps. The aim of the game for the player was to produce the best alignment, allowing her/him to claim the puzzle as their own and score points. The game was played in Facebook and took advantage of the player's social network to invite new players. The wider social network was used to encourage the replay of puzzles. We stored player names, scores, and the resulting alignments for later analysis. Here, we describe the Fraxinus game, the results of alignment comparisons, the response the game received, and details of parameters fitted to replicate player dynamics."

Each puzzle was played on average by 11.48 (standard deviation 7.08) players, and not all alignment answers were informative (we received 3.6 empty alignments per puzzle; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Table S1). We compared 7620 selected puzzles for differences in player and software alignments: in 4701 (61.7%) puzzles the alignments from all the high-scoring players differed from the computational alignment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). A further 2765 (36.3%) of the player alignment answers were identical to those from software. And with the exception of 154 puzzles (2%), the high-scoring players converged on the same answer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Most puzzles had replicate analyses; 6834 (89.7%) had two or more high-scoring players (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Together, these results indicate a high accuracy of alignment across puzzles and endorse the notion that replay leads to useful replication."

There were clear peaks of new visitors (mean 151.4) on dates with publicity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) with events in traditional media having a much stronger impact than social media alone (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Table S3). The number of returning players showed only a small increase (mean 2.6 returning per publicity event; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Most (62%) players joining on a press release date played only on that day, and 97.5% of all players played for 10 days or less (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). However, new players were more motivated, if they joined on a press release date and submitted 6.8 times more answers on average than those joining on other dates (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). A marked increase in empty answers was also observed on press release dates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), indicating that new players joining on these days have contributed to more empty answers than useful answers. This suggests that care need to be taken in assuming that all time contributed by players is equally productive. In total, 88% of all answers were provided by players who joined within the first 30 days (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Therefore, most of the analysis in Fraxinus was carried out within the first few months by players enthused by the initial publicity, with some benefit resulting from subsequent publicity."

The mean puzzles contributed per day for groups with different total game scores decreased in a linear fashion for all scoring bins, indicating that players' enthusiasm for the puzzles or cause decreased over time, irrespective of their success at the game (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Using these demographic parameters as a base, we developed a simple model to predict the productivity of any proposed crowdsourcing project. The model returns the number of players contributing to a project per day, based on an initial expected cohort of players, a returning player rate, and a new player rate. We can then calculate the work ultimately done for a task that takes a given amount of time to learn and execute. Our model is formulated as a decreasing power law relationship (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and allows for arbitrary increase in players as per those observed on press release days. The model accordingly recapitulates the observed result from Fraxinus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Predicted work time in the model was 935.53 days, while the actual total visit time was 924 days. Similarly, by modeling the impact of press releases, we predicted 150.11 days of additional play; the actual figure was 142.14 days."

One approach would be to use the actual number of players and returning/new player rate, as measured during the early stages of the project, as estimates. Our experience with Fraxinus has been one of constantly decreasing player numbers, in spite of repeated press releases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and the parameters of our player demographic distribution and the interest in our game have not been such that we received increases in player numbers after the initial release.

This situation is not inevitable; it is possible for the player cohort to grow over time, if the slope of the power law expression in positive player numbers can increase. In practice, this is equivalent to the number of active or new players exceeding those leaving. This could be achieved by an enthusiastic \u2018viral\u2019 growth spread, and the results from the model in this case are similar to those from SIR (susceptible, infected, and recovered) or rumor-spreading models (<a href=\"#bib17\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>). However, a viral strategy does not result in unlimited growth of player numbers, when the potential audience is saturated; instead, the amount of work performed begins to decline (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The work obtained by a viral strategy does not exceed that by a front-loaded strategy unless somewhat unrealistic growth rate is assumed (e.g., each player invites ten more players on the first day, and there is no restriction on the total available players; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

We allowed a random time delay of up to 3 months between joining and inviting new players and saw that the overall work was less than if invitation took place in the first 3 days. It is clear that by having a large initial cohort and not adopting a viral strategy, we maximized the work expected from Fraxinus. By applying our model to a proposed crowdsourcing project, it is possible to balance resources (such as public outreach, time taken to analyze data, and initial cohorts of contributors) in order to make the most of potential contributors and to determine whether the approach is likely to be feasible and worthwhile."

In the case of Fraxinus, we have been able to build up a small community of skilled users who are willing to collaborate and contribute to our goals. However, it is clear that scientists wishing to take advantage of crowdsourcing for citizen-science projects must be extremely focused to get value out. Our model of the human computing power that is available for a citizen-science project provides a guide for the design and implementation of future projects."

Further details on the number of answers are provided in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Table S1. As reads were selected with in the 21 base window (10 bases either side of the variant position), there were reads that did not cover the variant allele and led to misalignments by the player within the window (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Therefore, we focused our comparison using only reads covering the variant allele according to software alignments and restricted our analysis to 7620 puzzles carrying these reads. The absolute match/mismatch score ratio used in our game is 1.67 (5/3) expected a conservation of 50% between read and the reference and is higher than 0.33, 0.5, and 1, which are used for 99%, 95%, and 75% conservation between reference and read sequences (<a href=\"#bib16\">States et al., 1991</a>). Therefore, to be comparable between the alignments by players and software, we realigned the BWA alignments using the scoring system employed in Fraxinus game (BWA options -A 5 -B 3 -O 5 -E 2). Player alignments were stored in CIGAR format (<a href=\"#bib8\">Li et al., 2009</a>) with associated alignment start position. However, player alignment start position was set to start of the read, regardless of whether a read was soft clipped or not. So this has been corrected in the analysis. Each puzzle reference nucleotide position was taken randomly from software read alignment information. Therefore, reference sequence position information was corrected from the selected input variants data. For initial comparison of puzzles, position-corrected player alignment CIGARs were compared with BWA CIGAR strings from score adjusted BWA realignments. Then alignments were categorized as similar or different to software based on all high-scoring player outcomes for each puzzle. For each puzzle, the percent of high-scoring players aligned different software was calculated, in addition to percent of reads contributing to the difference. Database dump, data analysis scripts, and source are made available at the authors github (repository Fraxinus version1 data analysis)."

Individual read alignments were compared in two ways: (1) by calculating percent identity between read and the reference; (2) by calculating the alignment score employed in the Fraxinus game. Both percentage and score calculations for alignments were computed for the bases with in the 21 base game window and for whole read alignments. Any gaps opened and extended were considered as a mismatch in calculating percent identity between read and reference. Alignment score calculation within the game window was normalized per base to be comparable between software and player alignments."

The open source Ruby API for GA (<a href=\"https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client-samples/tree/master/service_account\">Google api ruby client samples</a>) was used to extract analytics information regularly. Extracted data included details, such as daily number of player visits, number of new players and returning players, percent new players and returning players, number of new players and returning players, mean duration of daily visit, and mean duration of visit by each player type. We extracted information about geographical distribution of the visits and number of players from each country. Player activity information from 12 August 2013 to 4 August 2014 (358 days) was used to generate reports about the trend of player visits and duration of visits by player type and player geographical distribution. GA uses persistent cookies to identify each player, which may result in an overestimation of number of unique players, especially if the cookies are deleted from the machine. From the comparison of number players registered in the Fraxinus game database and number of players counted from GA, we found that on average 7.25% of additional number of players were recorded by GA. Based on the number of new players and returning players visiting from the Fraxinus database, we estimated that each returning player visits 2.28 times per day. Based on the mean duration of new and returning player visit length, we estimated that 12.5 min was the duration by new players and 29.65 min was the duration spent by each returning player per visit."

Predicting the outcomes of a crowdsourcing project is certainly an interesting topic whose implications are relevant not only for scientists themselves, but also for R&D managers, administrators of granting agencies, and policy makers. The article describes a novel crowdsourcing project and provides relevant insights for crowdsourcing in bioscience. Nonetheless, there is considerable scope for the manuscript to be improved."
