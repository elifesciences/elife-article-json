Here, we report the first characterization of two parallel pathways for the breakdown of the short chain fatty acid propionate in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Using genetic interaction mapping, gene co-expression analysis, pathway intermediate quantification and carbon tracing, we uncover a vitamin B12-independent propionate breakdown shunt that is transcriptionally activated on vitamin B12 deficient diets, or under genetic conditions mimicking the human diseases propionic- and methylmalonic acidemia, in which the canonical B12-dependent propionate breakdown pathway is blocked. Our study presents the first example of transcriptional vitamin-directed metabolic network rewiring to promote survival under vitamin deficiency. The ability to reroute propionate breakdown according to B12 availability may provide <i>C. elegans</i> with metabolic plasticity and thus a selective advantage on different diets in the wild."
