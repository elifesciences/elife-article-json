                    "text": "Hutchinson-Gilford progeria (HGPS) is a premature ageing syndrome caused by a mutation in <i>LMNA</i>, resulting in a truncated form of lamin A called progerin. Progerin triggers loss of the heterochromatic marker H3K27me3, and premature senescence, which is prevented by telomerase. However, the mechanism how progerin causes disease remains unclear. Here, we describe an inducible cellular system to model HGPS and find that LAP2\u03b1 (lamina-associated polypeptide-\u03b1) interacts with lamin A, while its interaction with progerin is significantly reduced. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that over 50% of telomeres localize to the lamina and that LAP2\u03b1 association with telomeres is impaired in HGPS. This impaired interaction is central to HGPS since increasing LAP2\u03b1 levels rescues progerin-induced proliferation defects and loss of H3K27me3, whereas lowering LAP2 levels exacerbates progerin-induced defects. These findings provide novel insights into the pathophysiology underlying HGPS, and how the nuclear lamina regulates proliferation and chromatin organization."

                    "text": "Hutchinson-Gilford progeria (HGPS) is a premature ageing syndrome caused by a mutation in <i>LMNA</i>, resulting in a truncated form of lamin A called progerin. Progerin triggers loss of the heterochromatic marker H3K27me3, and premature senescence, which is prevented by telomerase. However, the mechanism how progerin causes disease remains unclear. Here, we describe an inducible cellular system to model HGPS and find that LAP2\u03b1 (lamina-associated polypeptide-\u03b1) interacts with lamin A, while its interaction with progerin is significantly reduced. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that over 50% of telomeres localize to the lamina and that LAP2\u03b1 association with telomeres is impaired in HGPS. This impaired interaction is central to HGPS since increasing LAP2\u03b1 levels rescues progerin-induced proliferation defects and loss of H3K27me3, whereas lowering LAP2 levels exacerbates progerin-induced defects. These findings provide novel insights into the pathophysiology underlying HGPS, and how the nuclear lamina regulates proliferation and chromatin organization."

HGPS is caused by an autosomal dominant C to T nucleotide substitution at position 1824 (G608G) in <i>LMNA</i>, which activates a cryptic splice site and results in a truncated and constitutively farnesylated version of lamin A called progerin (<a href=\"#bib14\">De Sandre-Giovannoli et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Eriksson et al., 2003</a>). HGPS fibroblasts have a greatly reduced proliferative capacity, abnormal nuclear architecture, persistent activation of DNA damage checkpoints and shortened telomeres (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allsopp et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bridger and Kill, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Goldman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Decker et al., 2009</a>). Critically shortened telomeres elicit a DNA damage response and trigger senescence, resulting in irreversible growth arrest (<a href=\"#bib11\">d'Adda di Fagagna et al., 2003</a>). Previous results revealed that ectopic expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) extends the proliferative capacity of HGPS fibroblasts and rescues progerin-induced DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kudlow et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Benson et al., 2010</a>). However, it remains unknown to what extent ectopic expression of TERT rescues all progerin-induced phenotypes, and whether physiological levels of TERT are sufficient.

Different lineages derived from reprogrammed HGPS induced pluripotent cells (iPSC) expressed varying amounts of progerin, with neural lineages showing the lowest levels, consistent with the fact that they remain unaffected in HGPS patients (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). These results suggested that progerin's detrimental effects depend on its levels of expression in a given tissue. To test this, we expressed increasing levels of progerin in primary and TERT+ fibroblasts by increasing the concentration of DOX (0\u20132000 ng/ml). This resulted in progerin inhibiting the proliferation of primary fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Defective proliferation was accompanied by a gradual increase in DNA damage levels, as quantified by the number of 53BP1 foci per nucleus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, left panel, p &lt; 0.01). The levels of progerin required to induce a phenotype corresponded to \u223c30\u201340% of endogenous lamin A levels (at 100\u2013250 ng/ml DOX; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>). Progerin therefore must reach a certain threshold to induce DNA damage and inhibit proliferation. Both of these effects were suppressed by exogenous TERT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>, right panel)."

To determine whether TERT would prevent progerin-induced chromatin alterations, we measured the levels of progerin and H3K27me3 in single cells by immunofluorescence. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, a scatterplot analysis of &gt;9800 nuclei revealed an inverse correlation between progerin and H3K27me3 levels (Pearson r = \u22120.43 and \u22120.24 for TERT negative and TERT+ cells expressing progerin, respectively, p &lt; 0.001, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, inset). However, progerin mediated loss of H3K27me3 was not prevented by TERT. The inverse correlation between progerin expression and loss of H3K27me3 is also apparent in two primary HGPS cell lines (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, Pearson r = \u22120.70 and \u22120.52 for HGPS 01972 and HGPS 11513 respectively, p &lt; 0.001), as well as in one TERT+HGPS cell line (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1K</a>, Pearson r = \u22120.5). To determine whether this altered chromatin state was sufficient to affect genome-wide gene expression, and whether TERT would prevent these changes, we performed a microarray analysis on primary and TERT+ cells expressing either lamin A or progerin at 4 weeks after induction. The expression of 142 genes was increased or decreased more than twofold in progerin vs lamin A expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Many of these gene expression changes were associated with senescence, including a reduction of Wnt2 (<a href=\"#bib64\">Ye et al., 2007</a>), increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kang et al., 2003</a>) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kortlever et al., 2006</a>). Expression of TERT prevented nearly all these changes in the differentially expressed genes, and restored the gene expression profile to that seen in cells not expressing progerin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). These results show that the inducible system reliably phenocopies HGPS cell characteristics in isogenic cell lines, and that ectopic expression of TERT prevents dose-dependent DNA damage, premature cellular senescence and senescence-associated changes in gene expression induced by progerin, independent of its impact on H3K27 methylation."

Endogenous TERT expression is a hallmark of ESCs and enables them to perpetually self-renew. Both lamin A and progerin were expressed in the ESC nuclei upon addition of DOX and localized to the nuclear periphery (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Expression of the exogenous progerin or lamin A did not impair the proliferation of the pluripotent ESCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), induce significant changes in gene expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), alter nuclear lamina structure, as measured by lamin B1 and emerin expression, nor affect the expression of the pluripotency markers Nanog, Oct-4 and Sox-2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). TERT is expressed in undifferentiated ESC, but is repressed during differentiation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armstrong et al., 2000</a>). To determine whether ESC would become susceptible to progerin expression upon differentiation, we aggregated ESC into embryoid bodies (EB), plated them in tissue culture dishes and measured the size of the differentiating EB outgrowth upon plating. While the total EB size did not vary significantly between the different conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), the EB outgrowth of differentiated cells was significantly reduced in progerin expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, p &lt; 0.01).

To determine how progerin may trigger senescence, we compared the protein interactomes of lamin A and progerin using BioID (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roux et al., 2012</a>). The Myc-tagged promiscuous biotin ligase BirA* was fused to the N-termini of lamin A or progerin, and expressed in fibroblasts by DOX-induction. To avoid complications from senescence-associated secondary consequences of progerin expression, we performed the comparison in TERT-expressing cells. Upon induction, BirA*-lamin A and BirA*-progerin were expressed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), localized at the nuclear periphery (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), with BirA*-progerin inducing lobulated and misshapen nuclei (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Protein biotinylation by the BirA*-lamin A and progerin fusion proteins occurred exclusively upon addition of biotin and DOX (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Biotinylated proteins were purified and analyzed by mass spectrometry. As expected, self-biotinylated BirA*-lamin A, BirA*-progerin, endogenous lamin A/C and biotinylated lamin B1, previously shown to interact with A-type lamins, were identified (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kubben et al., 2010</a>). Mass spectrometry analysis of pull-down fractions revealed several known components of the nuclear envelope/lamina, including lamin A, LAP2, emerin, lamin B1 and B2 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roux et al., 2012</a>). We compared the interactome of lamin A vs progerin, and quantified the differential interactions using the exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ishihama et al., 2005</a>). We observed a decreased interaction of the nuclear pore complex protein TPR with progerin, consistent with a previous report describing impaired nuclear import of TPR in HGPS cells (<a href=\"#bib57\">Snow et al., 2013</a>).

However, a previous report indicated that LAP2\u03b1 may directly interact with chromatin and telomeres (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dechat et al., 2004</a>). In addition, since exogenous telomerase suppresses progerin-induced defects, we investigated whether LAP2\u03b1 localization to the telomeres was altered in TERT+HGPS cells. To address this with sufficient resolution, we used 3D-structured illumination microscopy (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schermelleh et al., 2010</a>) to compare nuclei from TERT+ wild-type and TERT+HGPS cells. In normal nuclei, LAP2\u03b1 was present as discrete foci distributed throughout the nucleoplasm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), with many foci closely localized with telomeres, visualized by staining for TRF1, a component of the telomere-associated shelterin complex (<a href=\"#bib13\">De Lange, 2005</a>). We then measured the distribution profile of LAP2\u03b1 along a \u223c400 nm axis from the center of each telomere in 3D-SIM nuclear sections (544 nm thick), at 45\u00b0 angle intervals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). To eliminate any localization bias due to the observed differences in LAP2\u03b1 amounts between WT and HGPS nuclei (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, p &lt; 0.001, n = 17), we normalized the signal intensity to the maximum/minimum LAP2\u03b1 intensity for each nucleus. We found that in normal nuclei, the highest average LAP2\u03b1 signal intensity is within \u223c200 nm of each telomere. In contrast, in HGPS nuclei (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), the distribution of LAP2\u03b1 in relation to the telomeres was significantly altered, and reached its maximum value roughly 360\u2013400 nm from the center of each telomere (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

First, we depleted the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 isoforms of LAP2 using lentiviral delivered shRNA, and observed, in agreement with previous reports, enhanced proliferation of primary and TERT+ fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dorner et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Naetar et al., 2008</a>). To determine the consequences of LAP2 depletion in progerin expressing cells, we introduced v5-tagged progerin or lamin A into LAP2-depleted fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Surprisingly, and in contrast to normal cells, the loss of LAP2 enhanced progerin-induced proliferation defects (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, red arrowhead). However, this enhanced reduction in proliferation was rescued by TERT expression (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

To address this, we developed a DOX-inducible expression system to regulate the levels and timing of progerin expression in isogenic primary and TERT-positive cells. By using this system, we find that progerin inhibits proliferation, causes DNA damage and entry into senescence in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that progerin's detrimental effects become apparent only when levels reach a critical threshold. This provides a compelling explanation as to why tissues expressing relatively high levels of lamin A/progerin are central to the pathology of HGPS (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jung et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nissan et al., 2012</a>)."

We therefore compared telomere distribution, and their association with LAP2\u03b1, in HGPS and normal nuclei. We found that a significant proportion of telomeres can be found at the nuclear periphery, and that their distribution is not perturbed by progerin. This suggests that other progeroid mutations (<i>LMNA</i> E145K), or loss of <i>LMNA</i> may have different effects on telomere localization (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gonzalez-Suarez et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Taimen et al., 2009</a>).

In this model, telomeres in normal cells are surrounded by LAP2\u03b1 complexes, which in turn interact with nuclear lamins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In progeria, the impaired association between LAP2\u03b1 and progerin disrupts this organization and ultimately leads to premature senescence (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This can be prevented by expression of either telomerase or by increasing the levels of LAP2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). However, it is not clear if the effect of TERT mechanistically differs from the rescue by LAP2\u03b1. Our data suggest that this indeed might be the case: in contrast to LAP2\u03b1, TERT expression does not ameliorate the progerin-induced reduction in H3K27me3 levels. However, it remains to be investigated whether progerin affects H3K27me3 specifically at telomeric- or subtelomeric regions, and how expression of LAP2\u03b1 ameliorates this loss. Telomeres are fragile sites and a reduction in heterochromatin has been associated with increased susceptibility to DNA damage and cell cycle arrest (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sfeir et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Di Micco et al., 2011</a>). In agreement with this hypothesis, progerin expression destabilizes chromosome ends, causing DNA damage and premature senescence (<a href=\"#bib3\">Benson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wood et al., 2014</a>). By elongating telomeres, TERT counteracts such telomere loss and prevents the telomeric DNA damage associated with HGPS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1I,J</a>) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kudlow et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Benson et al., 2010</a>). In contrast to TERT, we found that increased LAP2\u03b1 alleviates the progerin-induced loss of H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>). Chromatin decondensation by treatment with valproic acid enhanced progerin-dependent proliferation defects. Taken together, our results suggest that increased LAP2\u03b1 stabilizes chromatin structure by increasing H3K27me3 and prevents progerin-associated DNA damage that resulted in premature senescence (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). In support of this notion, both LAP2\u03b1 and H3K27me3 decline during normal ageing in human cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Naetar et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Dreesen et al., 2013</a>), and it has been suggested that sustaining heterochromatin levels may extend lifespan by protecting against DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib38\">Larson et al., 2012</a>). Our results have important implications in understanding the role of the nuclear architecture, in particular the lamina and nuclear envelope, in regulating cell proliferation, chromatin organization and in providing novel insights into the molecular pathology of progeria. They may also be relevant to other laminopathies that are associated with perturbations or mutations of components of the nuclear lamina."

This system recapitulates several phenotypes observed in patient cells and other cell culture models, and the authors demonstrate that exogenous TERT rescues most of these phenotypes. Furthermore they show that a well-known binding partner of lamin A, LAP2\u03b1, has reduced binding to progerin and begin to investigate the mechanism by which reduced lap2\u03b1 binding may contribute to progeroid phenotypes."

Again it is unclear why the authors are going back and forth between systems but proliferation data are shown in the inducible expression system, whereas heterochromatin data are shown for patient cells. The authors should include experiments addressing how exogenous expression of lap2\u03b1 affects nuclear morphology, heterochromatin, proliferation, DNA damage foci, senescence, and importantly, telomere length/stability all in the same system. The telomere analysis is particularly obvious, given the data presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. Finally, the controls used in this figure are different. Throughout the paper and in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A-B</a>, wild-type lamin A is used as a control for progerin. However, the authors switch to a \u2018control vector\u2019 in panels C-J.

VPA treatment could, for example, lead to de-regulation of one or more transcripts encoding polypeptides responsible for the observed effects. Also, the authors have not directly tested the state of telomeric and subtelomeric heterochromatin but only looked at total H3K27me3 levels. The authors need to tone down their model, which is presented in a rather dogmatic way."
