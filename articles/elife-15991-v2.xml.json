Mutations in <i>NFU1</i> and <i>BOLA3</i> have been linked to genetic diseases with defects in mitochondrial Fe-S centers. Through genetic studies in yeast, we demonstrate that Nfu1 functions in a late step of [4Fe-4S] cluster biogenesis that is of heightened importance during oxidative metabolism. Proteomic studies revealed Nfu1 physical interacts with components of the ISA [4Fe-4S] assembly complex and client proteins that need [4Fe-4S] clusters to function. Additional studies focused on the mitochondrial BolA proteins, Bol1 and Bol3 (yeast homolog to human BOLA3), revealing that Bol1 functions earlier in Fe-S biogenesis with the monothiol glutaredoxin, Grx5, and Bol3 functions late with Nfu1. Given these observations, we propose that Nfu1, assisted by Bol3, functions to facilitate Fe-S transfer from the biosynthetic apparatus to the client proteins preventing oxidative damage to [4Fe-4S] clusters."

Mutations in <i>NFU1</i> and <i>BOLA3</i> have been linked to genetic diseases with defects in mitochondrial Fe-S centers. Through genetic studies in yeast, we demonstrate that Nfu1 functions in a late step of [4Fe-4S] cluster biogenesis that is of heightened importance during oxidative metabolism. Proteomic studies revealed Nfu1 physical interacts with components of the ISA [4Fe-4S] assembly complex and client proteins that need [4Fe-4S] clusters to function. Additional studies focused on the mitochondrial BolA proteins, Bol1 and Bol3 (yeast homolog to human BOLA3), revealing that Bol1 functions earlier in Fe-S biogenesis with the monothiol glutaredoxin, Grx5, and Bol3 functions late with Nfu1. Given these observations, we propose that Nfu1, assisted by Bol3, functions to facilitate Fe-S transfer from the biosynthetic apparatus to the client proteins preventing oxidative damage to [4Fe-4S] clusters."

Some of these proteins need to contain collections of iron and sulfur ions known as iron-sulfur clusters to work properly. The iron-sulfur clusters are first assembled from individual ions and then attached to the correct target proteins. In humans, yeast and other eukaryotic cells, the first step of this process happens in compartments called mitochondria and makes a cluster that contains two of each ion, known as [2Fe-2S] clusters. These [2Fe-2S] clusters can either be directly incorporated into target proteins, or they may be used to make larger iron-sulfur clusters \u2013 such as [4Fe-4S] clusters \u2013 in the mitochondria or the main compartment of the cell (the cytoplasm)."

Patients with this Multiple Mitochondria Dysfunctions Syndrome (MMDS) are afflicted with lactic acidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia and infantile encephalopathy typically leading to death in their first year of life. The syndrome is associated with an impairment of lipoic acid-dependent 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases arising from defective lipoate synthesis and defects in respiratory complexes I and II in select tissues including muscle and liver. These phenotypes arise from defective iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly within the mitochondria. The deficiency in protein lipoylation is due to impaired activity of lipoic acid synthetase, which requires two [4Fe-4S] cluster cofactors (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hiltunen et al., 2010</a>). The hyperglycinemic phenotype arises from failed lipoylation of the glycine cleavage enzyme. Whereas IBA57 and ISCA2 are known components of the ISA complex, along with ISCA1, which functions in the formation of [4Fe-4S] clusters within mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib46\">M\u00fchlenhoff et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gelling et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sheftel et al., 2012</a>), the functions of NFU1 and BOLA3 in Fe-S cluster assembly remain an enigma."

We confirmed the defects in [4Fe-4S] client enzymes reported for <i>nfu1</i>\u2206 cells showing that aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activities are markedly impaired, yet residual activity persists (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Aconitase activity is markedly attenuated in <i>nfu1</i>\u2206 yeast cells, whereas its activity is not significantly depleted in human <i>nfu1</i> patients (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cameron et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</a>).

Two Bol3 pulldown studies revealed limited levels of copurified Nfu1, although we never observed Bol3 in the pulldown of Nfu1 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>)."

While the defects are too severe to see the synergism by protein lipolyation and Sdh2 steady-state levels, the enzymatic activities of SDH and aconitase do reflect a synergistic effect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and C</a>). In addition, the level of assembled F1F0 ATPase was markedly reduced in the triple mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The severity of the phenotype and the impairment in F1F0 ATPase in the triple mutant likely arises from reduced mitochondrial translation likely through RNaseP, similar to the dominant negative Nfu1 G&gt;C mutant discussed above (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The growth defect of the triple mutant can be partially rescued by re-expression of <i>BOL1</i> or <i>NFU1</i>, but not by <i>BOL3</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

Mitochondrial BolA proteins are low abundance molecules (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) making co-immunoprecipitation studies challenging. Because of this, we tested whether increasing the levels of candidate interacting proteins would alter the abundance of Bol1 or Bol3. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>, the steady-state levels of Bol3, but not Bol1, were dramatically increased in cells with elevated levels of Nfu1. Additionally, <i>ISA1</i> and <i>ISA2</i> overexpression resulted in a modest increase in Bol3, but not Bol1, protein levels. In contrast, Grx5 overexpression led to a marked enhancement in Bol1 levels without altering Bol3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). In these studies Strep-chimeras of Bol1 and Bol3 were expressed from heterologous promoters, so the changes in protein levels are likely occurring through post-transcriptional stabilization. These stabilization experiments corroborate the genetic and proteomic experiments, all of which suggest that Bol3 (BOLA3) functions with Nfu1 in [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer to client proteins and Bol1 functions with Grx5 for a yet to be determined purpose."

Mitochondrial lysates prepared from either Nfu1-Strep or Bol3-Strep cells were separately chromatographed and fractions were assayed for Nfu1 or Bol3. The bulk of Nfu1 eluted in fractions corresponding to a globular mass of ~47 kDa, consistent with a homo-dimeric complex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Nfu2 from <i>Arabidopsis</i> is a dimeric species both as an apo-protein and with a [4Fe-4S] cluster (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gao et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, Bol3 eluted predominantly in fractions corresponding to a globular mass of 13 kDa consistent with a monomeric protein. No significant co-elution was observed between Nfu1 and Bol3, indicating that any Nfu1/Bol3 interaction is transient in nature. An additional set of chromatographic studies were done with mitochondrial lysates containing Nfu1-Strep in which lysates were treated with either 0.1 mM DTT or 2 mM dithionite to assess whether the apparent Nfu1 dimer was a disulfide-linked homo-dimer or a Fe-S cluster bridged complex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The abundance of Nfu1 in fraction 13 assessed by immunoblotting indicated that the elution properties of Nfu1 were unaffected by preincubation with DTT (followed by alkylation of cysteines by Iodoacetamide), whereas treatment with dithionite attenuated the apparent dimeric complex abundance. Fe-S clusters are susceptible of disassembly with dithionite treatment, suggesting that a significant fraction of steady-state Nfu1 in WT yeast mitochondria may be Fe-S loaded. In support of this conclusion is the observation that the Nfu1 AxxA mutant fractionates predominantly as a monomer."

We specifically focused on Lip5 that catalyzes formation of lipoic acid. In its catalytic cycle, one of its [4Fe-4S] clusters is consumed to provide two sulfur atoms needed to generate lipoic acid (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cicchillo and Booker, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cicchillo et al., 2004</a>). Thus, [4Fe-4S] cluster regeneration is needed to support Lip5 catalysis and lipoic acid levels. To address a role of Nfu1 in cluster regeneration in Lip5, we utilized cells containing a chromosomal <i>NFS1</i> under the control of <i>GAL1</i> promoter enabling glucose-mediated repression of Nfs1 expression. The GAL-<i>NFS1</i> strain was transformed with an empty vector or a vector containing either <i>NFU1</i> under the control of the regulatable <i>MET25</i> promoter, <i>BOL3</i> or <i>ACO1</i>. If Nfu1 were a reservoir of [4Fe-4S] clusters, we predicted that elevated levels of holo-Nfu1 would enable sufficient [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer to Lip5 to support lipoic acid formation in cells depleted of Nfs1. Cells pre-cultured in galactose were shifted to glucose-containing medium to repress <i>NFS1</i> expression and mitochondrial lysates were collected 8 hr later (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). The lipoic acid level in pyruvate dehydrogenase was reduced, rather than maintained, in cells expressing elevated levels of Nfu1 (low 1x methionine cultures) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, lane 8, top band), but unaffected in cells overexpressing Bol3 (lane 11). Overexpression of the aconitase mimicked the reduced lipoic acid levels seen with elevated Nfu1 (lane 12). These results do not support a reservoir function of [4Fe-4S]-Nfu1 and suggest that elevated levels of a [4Fe-4S] protein, e.g. [4Fe-4S] Nfu1, may negatively impair routing [4Fe-4S] transfer to Lip5 for lipoic acid formation."

Nfu1 binds the client proteins independent of the ISA complex and its association with the ISA complex may serve to recruit apo-clients to the ISA complex where [4Fe-4S] clusters are formed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Some [4Fe-4S] client proteins may get their [4Fe-4S] cluster directly from the ISA complex, whereas others may derive their clusters after prior transfer of a [4Fe-4S] cluster to Nfu1. In these cases Nfu1 facilitates the process as an adapter protein in oxidatively growing cells. Additional work is required to discern the client selectivity in [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer by Nfu1. This model of eukaryotic Nfu1 function resembles the role of the <i>E. coli</i> Nfu1 ortholog NfuA, which binds a subset of Fe-S apo-client proteins and facilitates cluster transfer especially under oxidative stress conditions (<a href=\"#bib53\">Py et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Angelini et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boutigny et al., 2013</a>). Likewise, the <i>Azobacter</i> NfuA is reported to be critical under oxidative growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008</a>). In the case of <i>E. coli</i>, NfuA cluster transfer is likely mediated directly by NfuA (<a href=\"#bib53\">Py et al., 2012</a>). Bol3 likely functions with Nfu1 in cluster transfer, but its mechanism remains nebulous. Clearly, interaction studies separate Bol1 and Bol3 into two distinct classes, with Bol3 working with Nfu1 in [4Fe-4S] client binding and Bol1 working with Grx5, which has one known function upstream of the ISA complex (<a href=\"#bib63\">Uzarska et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kim et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Banci et al., 2014</a>). However, cells lacking both mitochondrial BolA proteins show a synthetic defect. The Bol3 protein may facilitate [4Fe-4S] cluster dissociation from either the ISA complex or Nfu1 in [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer. Additional work will be required to discern their mechanisms."

The study has been carefully done and quite clearly demonstrates especially the interaction of Nfu1 with the Isa complex and bol3 in Fe-S delivery. The role of Bol1 is less clear in this pathway as it is shown to interact with GRX5 and to bind 2Fe-2S clusters."

The authors are careful to point out that it is not yet clearly established what the specific roles are and suggest that there could be more than one function. Of the two dominant possibilities (1) cluster transfer from the primary assembly complex to the target 4Fe-4S protein (2) serving as a stabilizer/redox buffer of the apo-target proteins, the authors appear to, reasonably, favor (1)."

It seems to me that it would be very useful to the general reader if this work could be summarized in a table or two. In this way information in the table(s) could have superscripts that direct the reader to the relevant data presented in the various figures. The compelling aspect of the manuscript that justifies publication in <i>eLife</i> is that it provides clear biochemical linkage to known genetic defects in human patients, yet it will be good to structure the manuscript in a better digestible way."

The information is scattered in so many different figures, with much of the relevant data buried in the supplemental information, it is very difficult to keep track of the variously associated genotypes, phenotypes, and interacting partners. It seems to me that it would be very useful to the general reader if this work could be summarized in a table or two. In this way information in the table(s) could have superscripts that direct the reader to the relevant data presented in the various figures. The compelling aspect of the manuscript that justifies publication in eLife is that it provides clear biochemical linkage to known genetic defects in human patients, yet it will be good to structure the manuscript in a better digestible way.</i> "

Besides the extensive rewriting of the text, we elected to modify the figure set to move certain supplemental figures to the main figure set. This will obviate the need for readers to move back and forth between the main paper and supplement. For <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, we moved one key supplement to become panel <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>. This is a key figure to illustrate the effects of [4Fe-4S] defects on mitochondrial DNA translation via RNaseP. For <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, we moved one supplement to the main figure as <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>. For <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, we eliminated one supplemental figure that was redundant with the <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> Supplemental tables. For <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, we moved one supplement to the main figure to making inspection of the data easier. We generated a summary table as suggested, but found that too cumbersome. We are confident that moving these four supplemental panels to the main figures makes critical reading of the manuscript easier."

If, as the authors intimate, Bol1 acts upstream of the Isa complex which generates 4Fe-4S clusters, then it might make sense that anything compromising this would have synthetic affects with downstream proteins, like Bol3 which are involved in delivering these clusters to client proteins.</i> "

However, in one of the studies Mdh1 was only pulled down by WT Nfu1 and not the enhanced interactor mutant Nfu1. Thus, the FeS client proteins were the only proteins pulled down reproducibly. With Bol1, the only proteins that were pulled down in all interaction studies were Grx5 and Prx1. The Prx1 peroxiredoxin was a reproducible hit that we did not include in the initial Table, since we wanted to focus an independent study on this interaction. However, we have done follow-up studies with Prx1 and cannot find a FeS defect in mutant cells. Thus, we have amended our Table to include Prx1. No other reproducible interactors are evident."
