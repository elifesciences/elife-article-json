Here we show using murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (MS), that pain induces EAE relapse. Mechanistic analysis showed that pain induction activates a sensory-sympathetic signal followed by a chemokine-mediated accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells that showed antigen-presentation activity at specific ventral vessels in the fifth lumbar cord of EAE-recovered mice. Following this accumulation, various immune cells including pathogenic CD4+ T cells recruited in the spinal cord in a manner dependent on a local chemokine inducer in endothelial cells, resulting in EAE relapse. Our results demonstrate that a pain-mediated neural signal can be transformed into an inflammation reaction at specific vessels to induce disease relapse, thus making this signal a potential therapeutic target."

Here we show using murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (MS), that pain induces EAE relapse. Mechanistic analysis showed that pain induction activates a sensory-sympathetic signal followed by a chemokine-mediated accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells that showed antigen-presentation activity at specific ventral vessels in the fifth lumbar cord of EAE-recovered mice. Following this accumulation, various immune cells including pathogenic CD4+ T cells recruited in the spinal cord in a manner dependent on a local chemokine inducer in endothelial cells, resulting in EAE relapse. Our results demonstrate that a pain-mediated neural signal can be transformed into an inflammation reaction at specific vessels to induce disease relapse, thus making this signal a potential therapeutic target."

Many other diseases and disorders also have pain as a symptom, but it is not well understood if pain itself can directly contribute to the development of disease."

Arima, Kamimura et al. investigated whether the sensation of pain itself could trigger a relapse in a mouse model of MS. The experiments showed that a painful sensation could trigger a relapse in the mice via the so-called \u2018gateway reflex\u2019. This reflex describes the phenomenon whereby nerve impulses lead to the release of signaling molecules that cause the walls of nearby blood vessels to open and allow immune cells to move from the bloodstream to the central nervous system. This in turn stimulates the development of inflammation, which causes an imbalance in the affected sites of the central nervous system."

Soleus muscle-mediated sensory-sympathetic neural signals enhance inflammation amplifier activation in L5 dorsal vessels via local norepinephrine expression derived from sympathetic neurons to create gates through which immune cells reach the CNS and cause inflammation there (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arima et al., 2012</a>). These gates can be artificially manipulated via the activation of local neural signals by electrically stimulating muscles, resulting in an accumulation of immune cells in the intended regions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arima et al., 2012</a>). Gating blood vessels by regional neural stimulations, a phenomenon termed the gateway reflex, is an example of the neural signaling-mediated regulation of inflammation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tracey, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sabharwal et al., 2014</a>) and has potential therapeutic value not only in preventing autoimmunity, but also in augmenting the effects of immunotherapies against infections and cancers (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ogura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Atsumi et al., 2014</a>).

These results demonstrate that pain-mediated neural signals risk reactivating inflammation via the accumulation of immune cells at specific sites and therefore may offer a new therapeutic target for relapse in chronic inflammatory diseases like MS."

We isolated myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) specific CD4+ T cells from C57BL/6 mice having an immunization with MOG plus CFA and stimulated the resulting CD4+ T cells with the MOG peptide and antigen presenting cells in vitro. The activated MOG-specific CD4+ T cells (pathogenic CD4+ T cells), which include Th1 and Th17 cells, were intravenously injected into wild type C57BL/6 mice. EAE was induced within 1 week and disappeared at about 2\u20133 weeks after the transfer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We refer to this disappearance as the remission phase and these mice as EAE-recovered. In contrast, we found no relapse even more than 300 days after the pathogenic T cell transfer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Consistent with these results, it is known that the lack of natural relapses in the C57BL/6 mouse strain. Thus, our EAE model develops a transient clinical symptom upon the transfusion of pathogenic CD4+ T cells that is followed by the remission phase."

Although this pain induction did not accelerate disease development, particularly during the onset period (until 10 days after the pathogenic T cell transfer), the pain persisted and maintained symptoms at a high level from 15 days post T cell transfer compared with sham mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We found that pain induction itself (without pathogenic T cell transfer) did not induce the development of EAE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and that pain induced in mice with pathogenic T cells gradually caused a low clinical score over 20 days after the transfer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We found negligible cfos expression in neurons of the somatosensory area, which is a key area involved in pain sensation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2010</a>), in the brain of EAE-recovered mice and negligible pain sensation according to the von Frey test of the extremity, trunk of the body, face, head (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and data not shown), suggesting that remittent mice have minimal pain. Then we investigated whether pain induction was involved in the relapse of EAE. We induced pain in EAE-recovered mice that had developed transient EAE. Pain induction resulted in a relapse of EAE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Pain medicines such as Gabapentin and/or Pregabalin, which reduced cfos expression in neurons of the somatosensory area or von Frey test values after pain-induction (data not shown), suppressed the development of EAE relapse (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). On the other hand, capsaicin, a painful agent, injected into the whiskers or forefeet caused EAE relapse (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). A relapsing-remittent model of SJL/PLP mice was also suppressed by pain medicines (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Thus, pain induction developed relapse in EAE models."

Activated neurons, as defined by NeuN and cfos expressions, expressed the sensory markers TRPV1 and/or Nav1.8 in trigeminal ganglions. We found negligible cfos expression, however, in the subtypes of these markers in the absence of ligation in the remittent phase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Immunohistochemical experiments using serial sections showed that cfos+-activated neurons also expressed TRPV1 and/or Nav1.8 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Treatment with a Nav1.8 blocker, A803467, suppressed the development of the EAE relapse (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and TRPV1-deficient hosts showed suppressed relapse (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We also found that animals treated with A803467 and TRPV1-deficient hosts showed reduced cfos expression in neurons of the somatosensory area or low von Frey values after pain-induction (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, right panels and data not shown). Moreover, ligation of the facial nerves, which mainly contain motor nerves and the vagus nerves, which mainly contain efferent fibers such as parasympathetic and motor nerves to various viscera induced negligible development of EAE relapse (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and data not shown).

                                "text": "We then investigated whether sympathetic activation is also involved in EAE relapse after pain induction. We first investigated blood flow speed, which is controlled by autonomic neurons including sympathetic ones, in the dorsal vessels of L5 and L1, the bottoms of the forefeet, the hindlimb, femoral vessels, and brain surface vessels in pain-induced mice. Blood flow speed was faster in pain-induced than sham-operated mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These results suggested that sympathetic activation affects blood vessels in the CNS after pain induction. Consistent with these results, neurons of the somatosensory area, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), where sensory nerves are localized with autonomic nerves including sympathetic ones (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ikemoto et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Critchley, 2005</a>), were activated according to cfos expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Moreover, sympathetic ganglions were activated after pain induction, with the activation status in L5 being higher than in other cords (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Furthermore, treatment with atenolol, an inhibitor of the norepinephrine \u03b21 receptor, significantly suppressed the relapse development (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and treatment with 6-OHDA, which induces sympathectomy, suppressed the EAE relapse (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), while mice treated with atenolol and 6-OHDA did not suppress cfos expression in neurons of the somatosensory area after pain induction (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, EAE mice under immobilization stress or forced swimming did not show EAE relapse, although these conditions did increase serum corticosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine similarly to pain induction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Therefore, these data suggest specific sympathetic pathways triggered by pain induction, but not pain-mediated systemic hormonal responses and/or stress-mediated events, play a role in the development of EAE relapse."

To induce pain, we mainly used nerve injury via the trigeminal nerves and painful agents including capsaicin injected into the whiskers or forefeet. To clarify if the relapse responses were due to neural signals and not pain-mediated systemic hormonal responses or stress-mediated events, we first investigated sensory and sympathetic pathways, finding that sensory neurons expressing TRPV1 and/or Nav1.8, sensory-sympathetic connections in the ACC, and sympathetic neurons were involved in the response. On the other hand, EAE mice under stress conditions did not develop EAE relapse, although the stress inductions did increase serum corticosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine similarly to pain induction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>).

CD11b+ cells in the CNS are likely to express CX3CL1, because these cells induced CX3CL1 after norepinephrine stimulation, at least in vitro (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The number of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells was higher in the L5 cord than other cords, particularly in EAE-recovered mice, even without pain induction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The L5 specificity of the relapse development may be because the L5 cord is the site of initial inflammation and is the tissue most damaged during the primary development of EAE. Moreover, it is known that a certain level of the sympathetic pathway is activated by anti-gravity responses even at steady state (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arima et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, we hypothesized that a low but sufficient level of sympathetic activation may maintain a low level of the inflammation state in the L5 cord to accumulate MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the L5 cord of EAE-recovered mice and develop EAE relapse after pain induction."

Thus, accumulation of both MHC class II+CD11b+ cells and pathogenic CD4+ T cells at the ventral vessels of the L5 cord stimulate the excessive expression of chemokines in non-immune cells to trigger the EAE relapse."

Therefore, FACS analysis will not reveal sequential steps. The results of the blocking experiments, however, do show obvious four steps: Regarding the first step, blockades of sensory pathways by using A803467, TRPV1-deficient hosts, and MK801 at the ACC region suppressed somatosensory activations, sympathetic activations, and MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, and EAE-relapse. Regarding the second step, we used atenolol and 6-OHDA to suppress sympathetic activation and MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels and/or EAE-relapse. However, this treatment did not affect sensory-mediated somatosensory activations, suggesting that sympathetic activation is a downstream event after sensory activation. Also regarding the second step, blockade of CX3CL1 did suppress MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels and EAE-relapse but not somatosensory activations and sympathetic activations, suggesting that CX3CL1 expression is a downstream event after sensory and sympathetic activation. Regarding the third step, anti-CD4 antibody application suppressed CD4+ T cell accumulation in the ventral vessels and EAE-relapse but not somatosensory activations, sympathetic activations, or MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, suggesting that CD4+ T cell accumulation is a downstream event of sensory and sympathetic activation and of MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels. MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels as observed within 8 hr. Regarding the fourth step, blockades of IL-17 and IL-6 signal by neutralizing antibodies suppressed EAE-relapse but not somatosensory activations, sympathetic activations, MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, or CD4+ T cell accumulation, suggesting that the inflammation amplifier activation by cytokines including IL-17 and IL-6 is a downstream event after sensory and sympathetic activation, MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, and pathogenic Th17 cell accumulation in the ventral vessels. These results clearly suggested there are the four-steps that occur sequentially and are critical for the development of pain-mediated EAE relapse in our EAE models."

We used normal mice for anti-gravity experiments, but EAE-recovered mice for pain-mediated ones. In other words, the numbers of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells are completely different: normal mice have almost no MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS, while EAE-recovered mice have many MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS particularly in the L5 cord. In EAE-recovered mice, a regional norepinephrine output via pain inductions functions on MHC class II+CD11b+ cells as well as endothelial cells around the ventral vessels of the spinal cords, causing the expression of CX3CL1 and accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+CX3CR1+ cells in a manner dependent on the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis. These accumulated MHC class II+CD11b+CX3CR1+ cells present autoantigens to pathogenic Th17 cells located in the blood stream. On the other hand, in normal mice, a regional norepinephrine output via anti-gravity responses functions just on endothelial cells because of there are almost no MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS. This case results in CCL20 expression, which causes the accumulation pathogenic Th17 cells that express the CCR6 receptor, IL-17 and IL-6."

However, epinephrine and norepinephrine induced CX3CL1 expression dose-dependently in MHC class II+CD11b+ cells, which are also present in spleen and lymphonodes, and endothelial cells and fibroblasts induced various chemokines, including CCL20, after stimulation by epinephrine and norepinephrine, particularly in the presence of NFkB and STAT3 activation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arima et al., 2012</a>).

Kalia and O'Connor found that the proportion of patients with a progressive course of MS trend higher among patients with chronic types of pain (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kalia and O'Connor, 2005</a>). It was also reported that central pain is the first and sole symptom of MS relapse in some patients (1.6% of all patients, 6% of patients with central pain) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Osterberg et al., 2005</a>). At the same time, several reports have failed to show a clear relationship between pain and disease duration and/or course (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beiske et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kalia and O'Connor, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Michalski et al., 2011</a>). Thus, there does not seem to be a direct correlation clinically between pain intensity and MS disability or lesional load. We hypothesize that there are several reasons why we did not observe a clear relationship between pain and MS progression, which we explain in view of the above four steps. In the first step, differences in pain sensitivity and sensory activation among individuals complicate the investigation. It is known that loss of pain sensitivity may vary with the region or size of the affected site between patients, such that a bigger affected site correlates with less sensitivity in MS patients (<a href=\"#bib14\">Huber et al., 1988</a>). In addition, depression occurs with high frequency in MS patients (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chwastiak et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Siegert and Abernethy, 2005</a>), and this might also affect sensation. In the second step, the degree of sympathetic activation should vary among individual patients following the first step, as too might the connection between the sensory and sympathetic pathways. Moreover, depression in MS patients also affects the sympathetic pathway (<a href=\"#bib12\">Guinjoan et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rumsfeld and Ho, 2005</a>). In the third and fourth steps, which are mediated by autoreactive CD4+ T cell-mediated inflammation amplifier activation following MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation, different affected regions in quantity and/or quality between MS patients due to differences in the autoantigen distribution recognized by autoreactive CD4+ T cells and different neural activations in each patient should disrupt the relationship between pain and MS progression. Neural activations, which are critical for the establishment of autoreactive CD4+ T cell gateways in the vessels, might also be affected by various factors in each patient. These reasons might explain the disrupted relationship between pain sensation and MS progression. In our experiments, however, we managed to control the majority of these variations in MS mouse models. Thus, based on our analysis, we concluded that pain-mediated neural signal induces EAE relapse."

Even when MHC class II+CD11b+ cells are accumulated in a specific vessels, the inflammation is not induced without autoreactive CD4+ T cells, which recognized some autoantigens on the accumulated MHC class II+CD11b+ cells. We assume the sites of excess MHC class II+CD11b+ cells and sympathetic activations vary among patients as too the antigens recognized by autoreactive T cells, which would explain the variation in MS relapse regions. In other words, if we correctly detect the site of MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation, the sites of sympathetic activation, and the presence of autoreactive CD4+ T cells in the periphery, we might be able to discern where the MS relapse begins and how to regulate it."

Its specific novelty is a connection between pain perception via activation of TRPV1 sensory neurons to activation in the anterior cingulate cortex on the one hand, and a local epinephrine/norepinephrine-dependent induction of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 in the L5 spinal cord on the other. Findings downstream of that event in the L5 region, leading to accumulation of macrophages, CD4 and CD8 T cells, providing inflammatory cytokines and causing a paralytic relapse, then follow expectations from the authors' earlier work (Arima et al., Cell, 2012)."

Indeed, the number of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in each spinal cord, including L5, were basically unchanged before and after overnight pain induction (8 hours).

It should be pointed out that the sensitivity of the FACS analysis is low with regards to the MHC class II+CD11b+ cells and CD4+ T cells found in the immunohistochemistry. Therefore, FACS analysis will not reveal sequential steps. The results of the blocking experiments, however, do show four steps: Regarding the 1<sup>st</sup> step, blockades of sensory pathways by using A803467, TRPV1-deficient hosts, and MK801 at the ACC region suppressed somatosensory activations, sympathetic activations, and MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, and EAE-relapse. Regarding the 2<sup>nd</sup> step, we used atenolol and 6-OHDA to suppress sympathetic pathway and MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels and/or EAE-relapse. However, this treatment did not affect sensory-mediated somatosensory activations, suggesting that sympathetic activation is a downstream event after sensory activation. Also regarding the 2<sup>nd</sup> step, blockade of CX3CL1 did suppress MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels and EAE-relapse but not somatosensory activations and sympathetic activations, suggesting that CX3CL1 expression is a downstream event after sensory and sympathetic activation. Regarding the 3<sup>rd</sup> step, anti-CD4 antibody application suppressed CD4+ T cell accumulation and EAE-relapse but not somatosensory activations, sympathetic activations, or MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, suggesting that CD4+ T cell accumulation is a downstream event of sensory and sympathetic activation and of MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels. MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels as observed within 8 hours (overnight). Regarding the 4<sup>th</sup> step, blockades of IL-17 and IL-6 signal by neutralizing antibodies suppressed EAE-relapse but not somatosensory activations, sympathetic activations, MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, or CD4+ T cell accumulation, suggesting that the inflammation amplifier activation by cytokines including IL-17 and IL-6 is a downstream event after sensory and sympathetic activation, MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, and pathogenic Th17 cell accumulation in the ventral vessels. These results clearly suggested there are the four-steps that occur sequentially and are critical for the development of pain-mediated EAE relapse in our EAE models.

However, epinephrine and norepinephrine induced CX3CL1 expression dose-dependently in MHC class II+CD11b+ cells, which are also present in spleen and lymphonodes, and endothelial cells and fibroblasts induced various chemokines, including CCL20, after stimulation by epinephrine and norepinephrine, particularly in the presence of NFkB and STAT3 activation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arima et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Atsumi et al., 2014</a>).

We used normal mice for anti-gravity experiments, but EAE-recovered mice for pain-mediated ones. In other words, the numbers of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells are completely different: normal mice have almost no MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS, while EAE-recovered mice have many MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS particularly in the L5 cord. In EAE-recovered mice, a regional norepinephrine output via pain inductions functions on MHC class II+CD11b+ cells as well as endothelial cells around the ventral vessels of the spinal cords, causing the expression of CX3CL1 and accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+CX3CR1+ cells in a manner dependent on the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis. These accumulated MHC class II+CD11b+CX3CR1+ cells present autoantigens to pathogenic Th17 cells located in the blood stream. On the other hand, in normal mice, a regional norepinephrine output via anti-gravity responses functions just on endothelial cells because of there are almost no MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS. This case results in CCL20 expression, which causes the accumulation pathogenic Th17 cells that express the CCR6 receptor, IL-17 and IL-6. We have described these matters in the Discussion."
