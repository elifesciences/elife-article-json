This decision is vital in animals that reproduce in an all-or-nothing mode, such as bristle worms: females committed to reproduction spend roughly half their body mass for yolk and egg production; following mass spawning, the parents die. An enigmatic brain hormone activity suppresses reproduction. We now identify this hormone as the sesquiterpenoid methylfarnesoate. Methylfarnesoate suppresses transcript levels of the yolk precursor Vitellogenin both in cell culture and <i>in vivo</i>, directly inhibiting a central energy\u2013costly step of reproductive maturation. We reveal that contrary to common assumptions, sesquiterpenoids are ancient animal hormones present in marine and terrestrial lophotrochozoans. In turn, insecticides targeting this pathway suppress vitellogenesis in cultured worm cells. These findings challenge current views of animal hormone evolution, and indicate that non-target species and marine ecosystems are susceptible to commonly used insect larvicides."

This decision is vital in animals that reproduce in an all-or-nothing mode, such as bristle worms: females committed to reproduction spend roughly half their body mass for yolk and egg production; following mass spawning, the parents die. An enigmatic brain hormone activity suppresses reproduction. We now identify this hormone as the sesquiterpenoid methylfarnesoate. Methylfarnesoate suppresses transcript levels of the yolk precursor Vitellogenin both in cell culture and <i>in vivo</i>, directly inhibiting a central energy\u2013costly step of reproductive maturation. We reveal that contrary to common assumptions, sesquiterpenoids are ancient animal hormones present in marine and terrestrial lophotrochozoans. In turn, insecticides targeting this pathway suppress vitellogenesis in cultured worm cells. These findings challenge current views of animal hormone evolution, and indicate that non-target species and marine ecosystems are susceptible to commonly used insect larvicides."

The female worms spend roughly half their body mass in producing eggs and supplying them with yolk as a source of energy.

Yet the identity of this hormone that controls the life-or-death decision was not clear."

Unexpectedly, the hormone \u2013 called methylfarnesoate \u2013 belongs to a family of small molecules called sesquiterpenoids, which researchers previously thought were only found in insects and related groups. Hence, many insecticides have been developed to target sesquiterpenoid signaling and they are used in massive amounts to fight pests like the tiger mosquito (which transmits the Zika virus). Schenk et al. also found that these insecticides also cause severe problems in bristle-worms."

Another future challenge will be to investigate how this hormone actually promotes animal growth."

Some of the most extreme changes of energy expenditure are observed in so-called semelparous animals that reproduce only once and typically die afterwards. In both vertebrate and invertebrate representatives of semelparous animals, the switch to the reproductive state is accompanied by a massive breakdown of somatic tissue, in favor of forming and nourishing germ cells: migrating salmon break down about 50% of their white muscle mass while their gonad mass multiplies around six-fold during maturation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Mommsen, 2004</a>). Likewise, female squids exhibit almost complete histolysis of mantle muscle (<a href=\"#bib46\">Jackson and Mladenov, 1994</a>), and in mature female squids up to\u00a0~60% of the total body mass at spawning consists of eggs (<a href=\"#bib62\">Rodrigues et al., 2011</a>). Similarly, in the marine annelid worm <i>Nereis virens</i>, oocytes represent up to about 40% of the body mass of the spawning adult (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hoeger et al., 1999</a>)."

In this study, we explore the marine annelid <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i>, a semelparous animal that can easily be reared in the laboratory (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hauenschild and Fischer, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fischer and Dorresteijn, 2004</a>) and has been established as a molecular model system over the last decade (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib79\">Zantke et al., 2014</a>).

Using this assay, we demonstrate that nereidin activity is not sensitive to proteinase treatment, challenging the long-standing hypothesis that nereidin is a peptide. Instead, we correlate nereidin activity with methylfarnesoate (MF), a substance belonging to the hormone class of sesquiterpenoids that has so far been assumed to be restricted to arthropods. We demonstrate that the concentration of MF drops in the course of maturation \u2013 as predicted from classical nereidin activity assays \u2013 and that eleocytes express the orthologue of a sesquiterpenoid receptor. This, together with our finding that MF exerts its action on <i>vitellogenin</i> production not only in cell culture, but also <i>in vivo</i>, establishes MF as a brain hormone orchestrating a critical metabolic switch in <i>P. dumerilii</i>. We finally show that insecticides targeting the sesquiterpenoid pathway interfere with <i>Platynereis</i> vitellogenesis, revealing a profound impact of insect growth regulators on a presumed non-target organism that serves as a key marine reference species."

Yolk protein is derived by endocytotic uptake of Vtg into the oocyte (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fischer et al., 1991</a>), where it accounts for more than 40% of protein (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fischer and Schmitz, 1981</a>), reflecting its central role as reproductive investment.

Eleocytes and oocytes are freely floating in the coelomic cavity and can therefore easily be isolated and taken into primary (co)-culture, making them an excellent experimental model system to assess and monitor maturation in <i>Platynereis</i> and other nereidids, and to investigate the concomitant metabolic changes associated with this process."

As a first step, we identified a <i>Platynereis vtg</i> candidate in eleocyte transcriptome data (Sven Schenk, Fritz Sedlazeck, Florian Raible, unpublished). Domain analyses and molecular phylogeny indicate that the protein encoded by this gene is an orthologue of Vtg identified in other animals (insects, molluscs, amphibians and birds; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Next, we designed qRT-PCR primers to test if <i>vtg</i> transcript levels in <i>P. dumerilii</i> eleocytes increased over female maturation, as suggested by the increase of Vtg protein secretion in <i>P. cultrifera</i> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baert and Slomianny, 1992</a>). Indeed, we found a strong correlation between <i>vtg</i>-transcript abundance in eleocytes and the maturation state of the animal (as assessed by oocyte diameter, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that <i>vtg</i> transcript levels could be used for a quantitative maturation assay. Given the central metabolic role of eleocytes in the reproductive switch, we further hypothesised that nereidin acts directly on eleocytes to regulate <i>vtg</i> production. We therefore designed a bioassay that takes coelomic cells into primary cell culture. After adding fractions of our purification scheme to small aliquots of this culture, and incubating these overnight, we extracted RNA from the cells and analysed them by qRT-PCR to determine the levels of <i>vtg</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

This assumption was mainly based on the results of partial characterisation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Durchon, 1984</a>), as well as histological observations, by which the brain regions producing nereidin were shown to contain highly active secretory cells (<a href=\"#bib57\">M\u00fcller, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Hofmann, 1976</a>). To assess whether the recovered nereidin activity was of proteinaceous nature, we treated the obtained eluate with proteinase K, and tested if this affected the ability of the eluate to repress <i>vtg</i> levels in cell culture. Our results demonstrate that nereidin is insensitive to proteinase K-treatment, thus strongly arguing against the notion that it is a neuropeptide hormone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

A total of 16 fractions eluting from the column were collected and tested in the cell culture-based bioassay for their impact on <i>vtg</i> transcript levels.

Strongest effects were observed in the range between 1 and 100 nM MF, in agreement with physiological concentrations expected for a hormone. To ascertain the specificity of MF in down regulation of <i>vtg</i> transcripts in vitro, coelomic cells were also challenged with structurally related compounds such as palmitic acid (PA) and all-<i>trans</i>-retinoic acid (RA).

Both functions have been used interchangeably in nereidin research. However, the lack of molecular candidates for nereidin has prevented the assessment of whether both functions rely on identical molecules, or if they can be separated. In a final set of experiments, we therefore tested if MF had any impact on regeneration of caudal body segments. To minimise inter-individual variations in regenerative capacities (<a href=\"#bib27\">Golding, 1967b</a>), we followed a similar approach as <a href=\"#bib37\">Hauenschild (1974)</a> in which hormone-exposed and control fragments were derived from the same animal. In addition, as in our maturation assays, we aimed to develop a quantitative approach to assess the molecular effect of MF on caudal regeneration. For this, we established a qRT-PCR assay quantifying the expression of the homeobox gene <i>hox3. Hox3</i> expression has earlier been demonstrated to be a highly specific early on marker in caudal regeneration (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pfeifer et al., 2012</a>). More specifically, it has recently been linked to ectodermal cells of likely stem cell character (ectoteleoblasts, <a href=\"#bib24\">Gazave et al., 2013</a>) involved in the regenerative process. Our results show that the expression of <i>hox3</i> is significantly up-regulated (~2 fold) after 5 days in test fragments treated with 100 nM MF when compared to DMSO-treated control fragments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This finding is consistent with the idea that besides its role in repressing maturation, MF may also contributes to sustaining putative stem cells involved in regeneration."

Likewise, our quantifications of MF levels over the course of reproductive development (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) are consistent with the decline in nereidin activity present in transplanted heads of different stages. Although\u00a0our data clearly argue against the long-held assumption that nereidin is a neuropeptide, they are still consistent with the chemical properties (apparent mass, lipophilic nature) that have been derived from previous purification attempts.

As annelids and molluscs are large groups within the lophotrochozoan superphylum (<a href=\"#bib30\">Halanych et al., 1995</a>), this implies a potential physiological role for sesquiterpenoids in a broad set of (mostly aquatic) species."

Capital breeding strategies allow animals to time their reproduction more precisely and have larger clutches of offspring than could be afforded by daily nutrient uptake. It likely represents an ancient reproductive strategy that is very common in poikilothermic animals (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bonnet et al., 1998</a>). Therefore, it is plausible that the role for MF uncovered in the marine annelid <i>Platynereis</i> could reflect a more general role of sesquiterpenoids in regulating reproductive energy expenditure. The inhibitory function for maturation we uncover in <i>Platynereis</i> is reminiscent of the juvenoid functions of insect juvenile hormones: During pre-adult development, these provide a molecular cue for juvenile status, preventing insects from entering into adulthood, and thereby indirectly preventing reproductive energy expenditure as well. Likewise, MF treatment of larval stages of crustaceans can delay metamorphosis or prevent gonad formation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Borst et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Tsukimura et al., 2006</a>)."

In contrast to our results in worms, juvenile hormones commonly act as positive regulators of vitellogenesis in the adult insect fat body, whereas their down-regulation is associated with diapause and longevity (<a href=\"#bib29\">G\u00e4de et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Wyatt, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hansen et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, MF promotes adult maturation, vitellogenesis and mating behaviour in crustaceans (<a href=\"#bib51\">Laufer et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Homola and Chang, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Subramoniam, 2011</a>), with a separate function in sex determination (<a href=\"#bib72\">Toyota et al., 2015</a>). As <i>Platynereis</i> retains certain MF levels even in the mature stage (see above), it will be a suitable model to address additional roles of MF in the life history of an annelid."

Reproductive hormones are attractive targets for pesticides. Juvenile hormone analogues like methoprene and later pyriproxyfen have initially been designed to interfere with insect development and are broadly used to fight insect pests such as <i>Aedes</i>, a vector for dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever viruses (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib39\">Henrick, 2007</a>). The discovery the sesquiterpenoid MF in crustaceans by <a href=\"#bib51\">Laufer et al. (1987)</a> already raised concerns if the effect of juvenile hormone analogues is restricted to insect development (<a href=\"#bib74\">Walker et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abe et al., 2015</a>), calling for more specific tests with non-target species. Our results argue that aquatic lophotrochozoans should also be systematically included in specificity tests for compounds targeting sesquiterpenoid signalling pathway, and that such tests should not be restricted to mortality (<a href=\"#bib39\">Henrick, 2007</a>), but include assays on reproductive fitness. For instance, in our studies, pyriproxyfen impacts on <i>vtg</i> levels at concentrations of 10 nM which lies in the range of pyriproxyfen found in surface waters (<a href=\"#bib68\">Sullivan and Goh, 2008</a>). In turn, sesquiterpenoid analogues may also be suitable leads in the search for specific compounds targeting pest species outside the arthropod clade or factors to favourably affect the balance between reproductive and somatic growth in aqua- and mariculture."

A result was considered as statistically significant if p&lt;0.05 in the case of t-tests, and p&lt;0.10 in the case of ANOVA, the following t-test were then again considered to yield a statistically significant result if p<sub>adj</sub>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05.

As a technical side note, we have not been able to obtain pure preparations of distinct insect juvenile hormones to be able to test this in our bioassay. We have, however, introduced a clarifying statement on cross-reactivities in the section where we discuss classical reports on the bioactivity of annelid extracts in insect juvenile hormone bioassays (Discussion, sixth paragraph)."

There is a variety of sesquiterpenoid-based insect growth regulators with different chemical side groups, and we note that MF is more lipophilic than methoprene, which may explain why methoprene has more subtle effects at the tested conditions. However, we also note that there are additonal parameters (time, temperature, light regimes) that may play into the availability and efficacy of these drugs."

Moreover, we included the dataset on pyriproxyfen, which is a chemically distinct, but highly used insecticide, and shows clear activity in the bioassay as well. This finding further substantiates similarities between the signalling pathways in insects and annelids, and also supports the relevance of our evolutionary discovery for the specificity of pest control mechanisms."
