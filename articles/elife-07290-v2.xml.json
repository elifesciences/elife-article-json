Here, we use in vivo patch-clamp recordings to show that locomotion can be directly read out from mossy fiber synaptic input and spike output in single granule cells. The increase in granule cell spiking during locomotion is enhanced by glutamate spillover currents recruited during movement. Surprisingly, the entire step sequence can be predicted from input EPSCs and output spikes of a single granule cell, suggesting that a robust gait code is present already at the cerebellar input layer and transmitted via the granule cell pathway to downstream Purkinje cells. Thus, synaptic input delivers remarkably rich information to single neurons during locomotion."

Here, we use in vivo patch-clamp recordings to show that locomotion can be directly read out from mossy fiber synaptic input and spike output in single granule cells. The increase in granule cell spiking during locomotion is enhanced by glutamate spillover currents recruited during movement. Surprisingly, the entire step sequence can be predicted from input EPSCs and output spikes of a single granule cell, suggesting that a robust gait code is present already at the cerebellar input layer and transmitted via the granule cell pathway to downstream Purkinje cells. Thus, synaptic input delivers remarkably rich information to single neurons during locomotion."

Inside this region is a layer of cells called granule cells, which are the smallest and also the most numerous type of neuron in the brains of mammals. Granule cells receive information from many other parts of the brain and respond by producing electrical signals that influence the motor system, which tells our muscles how to move. However, it is not clear how the granule cells interpret the information they receive and ensure that the right muscles are stimulated at the right time by the motor system."

This is a powerful approach as it enables the recording of both the information received by each granule cell (input) and the electrical signals produced by it in response (output). Each mouse was placed on a treadmill with its head held still and given the choice to either rest or walk. These experiments show that when the mouse is resting, the granule cells are mostly inactive, producing only very low levels of fast electrical signals called \u2018spikes\u2019. When the mouse starts walking, the input to the granule cells triggers a strong increase in spiking in the granule cells."

Remarkably, this model could be used to predict walking patterns of the mouse based on the activity of a single granule cell and its inputs. These findings suggest that even single neurons in the cerebellum contain rich information about the movement of the animal. The next challenge is to understand how this code interacts with the rest of the motor system to produce precisely coordinated movements. Furthermore, it will be important to determine whether a similar code is used in other parts of the brain that control movement."

Purkinje cells, the output cells of the cerebellar cortex, exhibit firing linked to the phase of the step cycle during locomotion (<a href=\"#bib30\">Orlovsky, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Armstrong and Edgley, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Edgley and Lidierth, 1988</a>). How this information is represented in and transmitted by upstream neurons in the circuit, in particular in cerebellar granule cells\u2014which form the input layer of the cerebellar cortex\u2014remains unknown. Here we have taken advantage of the electrical compactness of granule cells, and their small number of excitatory inputs\u20144 on average (<a href=\"#bib17\">Eccles et al., 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Palkovits et al., 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jakab and Hamori, 1988</a>)\u2014which allows for individual synaptic inputs to be resolved in vivo (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chadderton et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">J\u00f6rntell and Ekerot, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rancz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arenz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chadderton et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, since granule cell activity plays a key role in regulating locomotion, including the coordination of individual limbs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vinueza Veloz et al., 2014</a>) as well as in in motor learning (<a href=\"#bib20\">Galliano et al., 2013</a>), they represent particularly attractive targets for an electrophysiological dissection of their input\u2013output relationships during locomotion. By recording the activity of mossy fiber boutons, EPSCs in granule cells, and granule cell output while mice are moving on a treadmill, we can thus reconstruct single cell integration of synaptic inputs in awake animals during locomotion, and identify the cellular representation of movement parameters in a defined site in the circuit."

NMDA receptor activation could in theory underlie such slow currents; however the NMDA current is negligible in cerebellar granule cells at our \u221270 mV holding potential, due to the voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of the NMDA receptor channel (<a href=\"#bib29a\">Nieus et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We confirmed that the NMDA current is negligible using a GC model (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diwakar et al., 2009</a>), adapted to match the NMDA/AMPA ratio of 0.2 found in adult mice (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cathala et al., 2003</a>). At \u221270 mV, NMDA contributes at most 0.4% of the total excitatory synaptic current in this model. Furthermore, it has previously been shown (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cathala et al., 2003</a>) that in the age and species of mice from which our data is derived, the vast majority of the NMDA current is transmitted by extrasynaptic receptors.

The amplitude of the slow current was correlated with the EPSC frequency (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> shows this for an individual cell; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> for the population of n = 9 cells), such that the proportion of the total current carried by the fast EPSCs vs the slow current diminished with EPSC rate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), similar to what has been shown in vitro in response to trains of synaptic stimulation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sargent et al., 2005</a>). Since spillover results from synaptic accumulation of neurotransmitter, a delay would be expected between the peak of the EPSCs and that of the putative spillover current. Indeed, a cross-correlation between the instantaneous frequency of fast EPSCs and the slow currents showed a peak with a lag of 40 ms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), with the slow current lagging the fast events. Similarly, aligning the slow current on a burst of at least 5 EPSCs at 200 Hz or above exhibited a negative peak at positive delay (31 ms latency; 729 bursts from the 9 cells, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We further plotted the synaptic charge transfer over 100 ms as a function of EPSC rate with and without spillover (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The spillover dramatically affects the slope of this curve."

In current clamp recordings from granule cells, we observed that spiking occurs in bursts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>; 37 bursts recorded in 4 out of 7 cells), which were frequently accompanied by a slow depolarization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, left panel). As predicted, there was a significant correlation (r = 0.45, p = 5.5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>) between the amplitude of the slow depolarization and the spike frequency in the burst. We hypothesized that the spillover could contribute to such spiking episodes. To study this, we used a spiking compartmental model of a granule cell (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diwakar et al., 2009</a>), with an excitatory synaptic conductance based on the fast EPSCs and slow spillover currents recorded in voltage clamp. The depolarization generated by the slow spillover current was able to facilitate bursts that were not observed with fast EPSCs alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Consistent with this, the combination of spillover and fast currents produced significantly more spikes than either the spillover or fast current in isolation, indicating a synergistic non-linear interaction between the two currents (spiking rate for spillover alone: 2.69 \u00b1 3.78 Hz, for fast EPSCs: 1.01 \u00b1 0.94 Hz, for both: 9.27 \u00b1 6.36 Hz, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>, p = 3.39 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22126</sup>; one way ANOVA). Next, we assessed the possible contribution of NMDA receptor currents to spiking under these conditions. We performed simulations using an NMDA to AMPA ratio of 0.2, which is physiological at this synapse (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cathala et al., 2003</a>). Under these conditions a spiking rate of 9.74 \u00b1 6.51 Hz is obtained, which is only slightly higher than without the NMDA channels (rate 9.37 \u00b1 6.35 Hz, p = 2.70 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>; paired t-test). We conclude that the slow putative spillover current contributes significantly to spike generation in awake, locomoting animals."

Anatomically coherent regions of the mouse showed strong signals (19 out of 20 of these maps showed significant signals in the regions corresponding to one or more of the limbs, 9 out of 20 for the head, and 11 out of 20 for the body of the mouse), suggesting that more specific features of the motion could be read out by granule cell activity. We therefore decomposed the videos into principal components (PCs), which corresponded to motions of the mice, most often showing limb motion and/or locomotion at different speeds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). For all the 20 cells recorded, we used a semi-automated labelling algorithm (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) to classify the 50 highest eigenvalues and found that 738 out of 1000 showed periodic limb motion, 434 showed periodic head motion, and 370 showed periodic motion of the rest of the body. We performed a sliding cross-correlation of the electrophysiological activity with the projection of the video onto the 50 PCs with the largest eigenvalues. For all recording modalities, peak cross-correlation higher than 0.3 and up to 0.55 could be found (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>); these correlations dropped below 0.2 after the 10th component. Note that the correlations were higher than with surrogate data (grey traces, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), which indicates that the neural activity correlated with specific PCA components more than would be expected by chance."

Animals initiated periods of locomotion spontaneously, and would often be still for several seconds between these periods. Electrophysiologically recorded parameters in mossy fiber boutons and granule cells were strikingly modulated by the step cycle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>), in either or both of the forelimbs. Specifically, statistically significant step cycle modulations were observed for mossy fiber bouton spiking (3 out of 4 cells for the right limb, 1 out of 4 cells for the left limb), granule cell EPSCs (5 out of 9 for the right limb, 4 out of 9 cells for the left limb), and granule cell spiking (0 out of 7 for the right limb, 2 out of 7 cells for the left limb); while spillover was not significantly correlated with step cycle. In <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, we show why it is possible that despite high cross-correlations between spillover and EPSCs, significant step cycle modulations are not seen: a temporally filtered EPSC trace (using a biexponential kernel with rise time = 50 ms and decay = 100 ms) exhibits a cross-correlation with the original trace which is similar to spillover (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), however its step cycle modulations are significantly lower (from 0.30 \u00b1 0.03 to 0.13 \u00b1 0.2, p = 4.65 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, paired t-test; n = 18\u2014that is, 2 limbs for n = 9 cells), due to the low-pass properties of the filter."

Note that the algorithm used to constrain the model is unsupervised in the sense that the learning procedure is never shown the actual step sequence. A predicted step sequence was generated for each trace by producing the most likely state sequence for the HMM trained on the trace. This prediction was then compared to the actual step sequence. For mossy fiber spikes, granule cell spikes, and granule cell EPSCs we found that in some cells (2 out of 4, 2 out of 5 and 2 out of 9 cells respectively, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) accurate step sequence reconstructions (i.e., with p-values &lt; 0.05) could be obtained (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). In contrast, step sequences could not be reconstructed from spillover currents alone, indicating that while these currents are permissive for spiking during movement, they do not represent the details of individual movements. Together, these findings indicate that rich information about locomotion parameters is available to single granule cells in the cerebellar cortex, even at the level of synaptic input."

Our experiments reveal that granule cells exhibit low firing rates in awake animals at rest, but high-frequency spiking during locomotion. Mossy fiber boutons can also exhibit dramatic increases in spiking driven by locomotion, which drives high-frequency bursts of EPSCs in granule cells, associated with a large glutamate spillover component that enhances spike output during locomotion. Surprisingly, locomotion can be highly correlated with the activity of single mossy fibers, EPSCs in single granule cells, and output from single granule cells. We demonstrate that a HMM allows the step sequence to be reconstructed from the activity of only a single mossy fiber; or EPSC input; or the spike output of a single granule cell. These findings provide crucial new insights into the synaptic representation of movement parameters, and how the cerebellar cortex processes movement."

Although two-photon imaging approaches should in principle help to resolve this issue, the scattering nature of the densely packed granule cell layer, and the lack of reliable single-spike sensitivity of current genetically encoded calcium sensors combined with the difficulty of separating synaptic and action potential-linked calcium signals in granule cells has made it difficult to reliably estimate granule cell firing rates using two-photon imaging (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ozden et al., 2012</a>)."

Moreover, the electrical compactness of the granule cells allows us to make voltage clamp recordings to probe synaptic currents driving spiking activity. We demonstrate that the low spontaneous firing rates observed at rest in granule cells, which are surprisingly similar to those in anaesthetized (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chadderton et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Duguid et al., 2012</a>) and decerebrate (<a href=\"#bib26\">J\u00f6rntell and Ekerot, 2006</a>) preparations, persist despite far higher spontaneous EPSC rates than are present under anaesthesia.

Since granule cells represent the most abundant neuronal type in the brain, and spikes are energetically expensive (<a href=\"#bib5\">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Carter and Bean, 2009</a>), the metabolic cost of sustained firing in this population would be considerable (<a href=\"#bib24\">Howarth et al., 2012</a>). Therefore the ability to maintain sparse firing in granule cells at rest could be an important mechanism for energy conservation in the mammalian brain. During locomotion, however, spike rates can increase dramatically. We demonstrate that movement during locomotion exhibits an unexpectedly strong representation in mossy fiber input received by granule cells, as well as in the spiking output of individual granule cells. Remarkably, in some neurons it is possible to reconstruct the entire step sequence during locomotion from both input patterns and spike output, indicating that gait information is present even at the level of single granule cells. This indicates that a rich amount of information about movement parameters is already represented by individual synapses at the input layer of the cerebellar cortex. Thus, selective sampling of granule cells exhibiting tuning to a given phase of the step cycle may underlie the step cycle modulation of simple spikes observed in Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Orlovsky, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Armstrong and Edgley, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Edgley and Lidierth, 1988</a>).

We only modified the model by adding a fixed tonic inhibitory conductance at the soma of 1 nS (E<sub>rev</sub> = \u221270 mV). The model was run in current clamp mode. To inject the patterns of excitatory input we recorded in vivo, we added an AMPA synaptic conductance (E<sub>rev</sub> = 0 mV) which was varied dynamically to correspond to the conductance underlying our voltage clamp traces, assuming a driving force of 70 mV. Our spillover analysis described above separated our voltage clamp recordings into the contributions from the fast EPSC current, and the slow putative spillover traces, so we could feed these separately or summated into the model and record the spike output of the model cell. We also performed simulations in which an NMDA receptor conductance was added to the spillover and phasic AMPA conductances, with an NMDA:AMPA ratio of 0.2 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cathala et al., 2003</a>), and a voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> block modelled according to (<a href=\"#bib29a\">Nieus et al., 2006</a>)."

The depolarization underlying a burst was quantified as the voltage averaged across a 5 ms interval starting 1 ms after the first spike in the burst, after subtracting a baseline voltage, defined as the average voltage over a 180 ms interval starting 20 ms before the first spike in the burst."

The standard pca function in Matlab was then used to obtain the PCs of this matrix, as well the coefficients of each video in this eigenbasis.

The output distribution was modelled as a mixture of four Gaussians. The observed data at time i consisted of a 360 ms window of the electrophysiological data starting at time i. For the EPSCs, the activity in each window was normalized to the mean; for the spiking data, the baseline activity (average activity of the first 90 ms in the window) was subtracted. All the parameters were initiated at random, except for the prior probabilities of the states and initial state transition matrix that was derived for each cell from the step data annotated manually. The Bayes Net Toolbox was then used to perform a Baum-Welch algorithm to optimize the prior probabilities, the transmission matrix, and mixture of Gaussian parameters. The Viterbi algorithm was then used to reconstruct the predicted state transition through the HMM."

We then used a commonly utilized metric between spike trains (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schreiber et al., 2003</a>) to compute the quality of the step reconstruction. Briefly, this measure computes a normalized, mean-subtracted cross-correlation between spike trains convolved with a Gaussian kernel (we used a sigma of 100 ms), and then takes the peak of the cross-correlation as the measure of similarity between the trains. This value can vary between 0 (no similarity) and 1 (identical trains). We multiplied this value by 100 to get a percentage score. For each limb, we took the average of the percentage score over 10 runs of the HMM algorithm to get the average prediction score. For each cell, we selected the limb that was best predicted by the activity and reported its prediction score. To test for significance for each cell, we generated bootstrap samples for each cell by repeating the above procedure on shuffled version of the electrophysiological data for the cell, and generating a z-score of the prediction score. The prediction for each cell was deemed significant if its associated one-sided p-value was &lt;0.05 after Bonferroni correction."

Using in vivo patch-clamp recordings, authors illustrated a correlation between locomotion and neural activities at the input stage of cerebellum, i.e. increasing mossy fiber and granule cell activities, and the increased spiking in granule cells is facilitated by glutamate spillover currents. Furthermore, Powell et al. found that the locomotion circle can be precisely predicted by the activities of some granule cells and suggested an alternative interpretation of information transfer from granule cells, which differs from the classical view of sparse coding."

As the mossy fiber inputs encode multiple modalities, and these modalities can converge onto the same granule cells, it remains unclear how come that all the recorded granule cells increased firing during locomotion. For instance, the increase of mossy fiber activity in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> shows a clear lag behind the onset of locomotion and a prolonged period after the termination of walking. This raises the question as to what extent the neural activities are influenced by the shift in brain state during locomotion?"

Our argument is that while spillover and direct (fast) transmission are correlated, spillover transmission provides mainly a slow increase in excitability, whereas the direct transmission provides fine-grained information about the animal\u2019s motion/sensory state. Reviewer 1 is correct that spillover and direct currents interact to generate additional output spikes. However, we demonstrate that what the spillover current is doing is effectively providing an independent means of regulating the synaptic gain. To explore this, we have now provided a new figure, which plots the total synaptic charge as a function of EPSC rate with and without spillover (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>).

To illustrate what we think is going on, we have made a new supplementary figure (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) in which we show that spillover acts like a smoothing temporal filter. We have taken the bins representing the EPSCs rate in our cells (n = 9), and convolved them with a biexponential kernel with rise time 50 ms and decay time 100 ms (these values were selected to mimic the on-off kinetics of glutamate spillover, see for instance Mitchell and Silver, Nature 2000); please note that the precise values are not important for the qualitative point we are making. Cross-correlating this filtered signal with the original EPSCs signal gives a qualitatively similar cross-correlation as with the actual spillover recorded (compare with <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), with a high peak value of 0.5. However, if we compare the locomotion modulation index of the filtered signal with the original EPSCs, we see that the filtered signal tracks the animal\u2019s step much less well (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1C</a>) \u2013 effectively because it is low pass filtering the information at crucial frequencies."

First, although all granule cells increase their firing rate during locomotion, the relative increases in firing rate span a wide range. The fact that the firing rates of some granule cells only increase very slightly indicates that the granule cells we recorded represent a diverse population with respect to their selectivity for different movement or sensory parameters. Second, please note that <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> shows increases associated with all motion\u2014locomotion as well as grooming, etc. To address this, we have now added a new figure (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) which shows EPSC rates just before and after periods of locomotion. Interestingly, EPSC activity does seem to \u201cramp up\u201d before the steps start, and be sustained longer than the last step. However to make a precise statement about the timing relation of this activity to total motor activity would require a more sensitive measure such as EMG over several muscle groups, which would necessitate a different experimental approach (and thus should be done in a subsequent study). Third, we do agree that there appears to be a shift in brain state during locomotion (which is hardly surprising given that this type of whole-body movement is likely to engage many sensory modalities and motor programs). However, the short-term modulations in event rates we explore in <a href=\"#fig3 fig4\">Figure 3 and 4</a> cannot be accounted for only by this state shift, since we are correcting for the average event rate (by using normalized cross-correlations and a modulation index in which the mean activity is corrected for). Finally, what this discussion illustrates is that the remarkable sensitivity and temporal resolution of these recordings offer an unprecedented view into how individual elements of the granule cell population parse information about sensory-motor integration, and set the stage for a range of different avenues to be explored in future using this approach."

However, this is based on simply dividing the mean EPSC rate by the mean spike rate, which is statistically unwarranted (especially for low n). Instead, one needs to calculate confidence intervals for the ratio of the mean event rates. There are several approaches that can be used (see for instance <a href=\"#bib35\">Roy, 1993</a>). For our data, we have employed the bootstrap method. Briefly, this creates a bootstrap distribution for the ratio by resampling with replacement of the MFT and EPSC event rates. Using this method, we get a 95% confidence interval of 3.49 to 17.67 at rest, and 1.69 to 8.39 during motion. Both of these confidence intervals are consistent with the 4 to 1 convergence."

To illustrate what we think is going on, we have made a new supplementary figure (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) in which we show that spillover acts like a smoothing temporal filter. We have taken the bins representing the EPSCs rate in our cells (n = 9), and convolved them with a biexponential kernel with rise time 50 ms and decay time 100 ms (these values were selected to mimic the on-off kinetics of glutamate spillover, see for instance Mitchell and Silver, Nature 2000); please note that the precise values are not important for the qualitative point we are making.

The strongest argument we have against this is the step cycle-related rate modulations: If the rate merely correlated with the amount of motion, then we wouldn\u2019t see down-modulations of rate during the swing phase of one limb as we observe in some of our cells (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2D</a>)."

First of all, these two graphs are measuring slightly different things (note there was a mistake in the axis label of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> which we have corrected): for coarse time scales we are measuring the raw correlations, whereas for the short time scales we are measuring the peak in the normalized mean-subtracted cross-correlation. The mean subtraction implies we have measured modulation in event rate versus modulation in motion index, so by definition these cannot merely be due to average motion. However, we stress that we agree with the reviewer\u2019s main point: there is a general increase in the event rates which is non-specifically related to motion, and there is a smaller modulation of rates which transmits information on top of that. Indeed we would argue that this is the main finding of our paper."

However we agreed with the comments in the previous revision that manual labelling of these components is fraught with subjectivity, which is why we settled on a\u2014less informative\u2014automatic labelling method. We think that the case for relative specificity of the neural activity for a given mode of motion is most strongly emphasized by the comparison with the gray curves generated with surrogate data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>: this demonstrates that there are clearly a few components which correlate far above chance with neural activity. Since these cross-correlation are again generated by mean subtraction, they cannot be due to a non-specific increase in rates with the general amount of motion. However, we have toned down the references to tuning to address the reviewer\u2019s concerns."

Furthermore, our metric (which requires precise timing and good recall/precision) and our algorithm (which is unsupervised) are quite conservative and it would be very surprising to be able to get close to 100% precision with single cell events. Given that granule cells are known to code for many different sensory modalities, it is surprising\u2014or at the very least non-trivial\u2014to be able to read out discrete motor events in the way we have shown. It is quite likely that if we optimized a supervised learning method to read out the step sequence, we would be able to improve the prediction score, but we feel this is beside the point we are trying to make, namely that the step sequence is represented in the granule cell layer, which is an entirely novel finding. Probably the most principled way to estimate just how much of this information is encoded would be to calculate the mutual information or transfer entropy between the step sequence and the neural activity, but these methods would require very long recording times to converge. Nevertheless we have modified the text to be more conservative in our claims about step prediction in a way we hope will satisfy the reviewer and editor."
