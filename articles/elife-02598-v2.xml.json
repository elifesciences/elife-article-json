This showed that although variations in the strength of the individual connections had no effect on swimming behavior of normal sea slugs, the same variations had a substantial effect when the brain was damaged.

The consequences of such hidden variability in neural circuits have not been addressed. One possible consequence is that it impacts the behavioral susceptibility of the animal to trauma. It has been noted that individual people differ from one another to such an extent that it can impair the ability to predict outcomes in cases of traumatic brain injury (<a href=\"#bib43\">Hukkelhoven et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Lingsma et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Forsyth and Kirkham, 2012</a>) or stroke (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cramer, 2008a</a>). Such variability can be hidden under normal conditions but cause differential survival of individuals in the face of critical challenges. In this study, we report that differences in synaptic properties, which were of no consequence under ordinary conditions, caused different outcomes when the circuit was challenged with an injury."

However, there are technical difficulties in manipulating specific neural circuit elements and providing precisely controlled lesions in the mammalian brain. In this study, we use a nudibranch mollusc, <i>Tritonia diomedea</i>, in which a neural circuit for rhythmic swimming behavior is widely distributed in the brain. The <i>Tritonia</i> swim central pattern generator (CPG) consists of three neuronal types: DSI, C2, and VSI (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which form a network oscillator circuit that produces the rhythmic bursting activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) underlying production of the rhythmic movements (<a href=\"#bib29\">Getting, 1981</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">1989b</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Katz, 2007a</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2007b</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2009</a>). C2 and VSI both send axons through one of the pedal commissures, Pedal Nerve 6 (PdN6), which connects the two pedal ganglia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Previously, we reported that disconnecting this commissure blocks or seriously impairs the swimming behavior and the motor pattern underlying it (<a href=\"#bib80\">Sakurai and Katz, 2009b</a>). In this study, we found substantial individual variability in the synaptic actions of C2 onto VSI, which correlated with variability in the susceptibility of the behavior to disruption following disconnection of PdN6. Such individual variability in neural circuit elements was hidden under normal conditions, but became functionally relevant only when the system was challenged by injury."

Combinations of triangles and circles are multi-component synapses. (<b>B</b>) An example of the swim motor pattern recorded from an isolated brain preparation. Simultaneous intracellular recordings from the three CPG neurons are shown. The bursting pattern was elicited by electrical stimulation of the left body wall nerve, pedal nerve 3 (cf., <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), using voltage pulses (8 V, 1 ms) at 5 Hz for 3 s. Arrows show onset and offset of the nerve stimulation. (<b>C</b>) The <i>Tritonia</i> brain and the site where PdN6 was cut in vivo. The body wall above the buccal mass was cut open (left).

These results indicate that the variability in the susceptibility of the motor pattern to PdN6 disconnection originates at least in part from the difference in the extent to which C2 inhibits VSI; animals in which C2 evoked larger hyperpolarizations in VSI were more vulnerable to having their motor pattern disrupted. Indeed, the amplitude of C2-evoked depolarization in normal saline (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, inset next to y axis) showed no correlation with the amplitude of the depolarizing phase recorded in Hi-Di saline (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), whereas it showed a significant inverse correlation with the amplitude of the hyperpolarization phase (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

Introducing an artificial inhibitory synaptic conductance in VSI corresponding to the times of C2 spikes caused no change in the number of bursts when PdN6 was intact (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A<i>ii</i>,B<i>i</i></a>). When the numbers of bursts recorded with dynamic clamp were plotted against the number of bursts without dynamic clamp, they lined up along the unity slope line (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B<i>ii</i></a>). Before dynamic clamping, orthodromic VSI action potentials were detected in 50% of the preparations during the swim motor pattern (N = 8 of 16). When the artificial inhibitory synaptic conductance was added to the soma by dynamic clamping, all VSI action potentials became antidromic during the swim motor pattern in each of the 16 preparations. This indicates that enhanced hyperpolarization in the soma suppresses orthodromic spiking in VSI, but the distal VSI terminal is still able to generate antidromic bursts."

Severe loss of brain function is often caused by a complex pattern of diffuse axonal injury in the white matter that are critical nodes for distributed network functions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Schiff et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Kinnunen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Squarcina et al., 2012</a>).

The difference was hidden under normal conditions. C2-evoked excitation of VSI is thought to be essential for initiating the ventral phase of each swim cycle during the swim motor pattern (<a href=\"#bib32\">Getting, 1989a</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Calin-Jageman et al., 2007</a>). <a href=\"#bib32\">Getting (1989a)</a> suggested that C2 excites VSI via direct synaptic action, but we found that the excitation of the proximal VSI process was mainly caused by a bombardment of recruited EPSPs that overrode the direct synaptic action of C2 onto VSI (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, the polysynaptic recruitment did not appear to play a major role in causing the individual differences in the extent of motor impairment after PdN6 disconnection. Rather, it was the inhibitory component of the direct synaptic action by C2 onto VSI that was more significant in predicting the susceptibility to the lesion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In Hi-Di saline, the C2-evoked synaptic potential in the proximal region of VSI can be detected from the cell body as a slow membrane potential change with an initial depolarization and a later hyperpolarization (<a href=\"#bib34\">Getting, 1989c</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Calin-Jageman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Sakurai and Katz, 2009b</a>). Stronger inhibition would counteract the depolarizing effect of recruited polysynaptic EPSPs in VSI and hence make the system more susceptible to loss of the distal spike initiation zone. Synaptic recruitment and concurrent actions of excitatory and inhibitory synapses have been shown to provide flexibility in neural network outputs in both vertebrates and invertebrates (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berg et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">McLean et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Sasaki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dougherty and Kiehn, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Kiehn, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Petersen et al., 2014</a>)."

Importantly, it did not affect the production of the motor pattern with PdN6 intact. This shows that this site of variability is not critical to the animal's behavior under normal conditions, but it becomes critical when challenged by lesion. Thus, this synaptic difference serves as a hidden phenotype that predicts the susceptibility of the neural circuit to disruption."

This further supports the role of this synapse in determining the susceptibility. Subtraction also caused an increase in the number of bursts per swim episode prior to the lesion. This is likely because artificial reduction of the inhibitory synaptic conductance would enhance C2-evoked depolarization through bombardment of recruited EPSPs, which would make the proximal spike initiation zone of VSI more excitable. This enhanced VSI bursting may have a cascading effect in swim motor pattern generation; by spiking more, VSI would decrease the burst duration in C2 and DSI, which may lead toward generating more burst cycles by releasing less serotonin in each burst (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fickbohm and Katz, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Katz et al., 2004</a>)."

In the mammalian brain, there is a general acknowledgement of variability. Individual variability in the susceptibility to neural damage may be attributed to substantial variation in the brain function and anatomy (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cramer, 2008a</a>). For example, the map of motor cortex is actually the population mean; among individuals there is substantial variation in the relationship between brain function and brain anatomy (<a href=\"#bib100\">Whitaker and Selnes, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Rademacher et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Van Essen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Cramer et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Cramer, 2008a</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Smith et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Walhovd et al., 2014</a>).

In such systems, individual identified neurons often play critical roles and researchers have taken advantage of the simplicity and reproducibility of the connectivity. The number, location, and anatomy of individual neurons are very similar among individuals and their synaptic connections are often drawn by connecting one neuron to the next. However, recent results in several labs have shown that there is considerably more nuance to this view of uniformity than initially appreciated. For example, in the snail respiratory CPG, it was shown there is individual variability at a specific synapse due to distinct activation of two different dopamine receptors (<a href=\"#bib59\">Magoski and Bulloch, 1999</a>). In the stomatogastric nervous system of crabs, it was suggested that similar neuronal firing patterns could be obtained from neurons with different compositions of ion channels and that different network configurations could produce similar patterns of activity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Golowasch et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Prinz et al., 2004</a>). More recently, it was shown that the properties of neurons vary substantially even though the overall behavior of the network is constant (<a href=\"#bib36\">Goaillard et al., 2009</a>). In the leech heartbeat CPG, it was found that there is considerable variability among individuals in the strength of synaptic connections among interneurons (<a href=\"#bib67\">Norris et al., 2011</a>). Despite such animal-to-animal variability, the CPGs produce the same or similar functional outputs. Interestingly, it has been recently shown in the crab stomatogastric nervous system that the bursting activities of circuit neurons showed different susceptibility to extremely high temperature, but such differences were hidden at temperatures within the physiological range (<a href=\"#bib94\">Tang et al., 2012</a>). A modeling study further demonstrated that different sets of network parameters could underlie differential sensitivity of neural circuit to extreme temperatures, but are \u201cgood enough\u201d to produce robust bursting activities under normal conditions (<a href=\"#bib75\">Rinberg et al., 2013</a>)."

Variability even in well-defined circuits indicates that there are many solutions to generating a simple function. These solutions might not all be equivalent; under different circumstances, such as injury, one solution might be superior to another."

The authors analyzed the influence of axon transection on the generation of rhythmic activity in a central pattern generating network for a simple mollusk motor behavior. Importantly, this network is one of the few examples across animal kingdom for which sufficient information exists about network topology with respect to single neurons involved. The authors analyze the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic actions of C2 onto VSI neurons in the swim network of the nudibranch Tritonia before and after the lesion of their axons connecting two separated areas of synaptic interaction. From the results it becomes clear that it is the relative strength of synaptic inhibition from C2 to VSI in one of the two areas that determines the sensitivity of the whole circuit towards inactivating the second area of interaction. To test this hypothesis dynamic clamp technique is employed to introduce artificial synaptic interactions between the C2 and the VSI. The results favor the hypothesis. The study provides evidence that contrary to the robust and predictable performance of a neural network in an organism there exists substantial inter-individual variability in a task specific tuning of topological and cellular properties. The study has been conducted in a thorough way, incl. data evaluation and statistics. I have the following issues that need the attention of the authors in order to clarify their findings:"

From the scheme in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> the appearance of EPSPs in VSI neurons independent from activity in C2 is difficult to be explained. Are there other neurons are intercalated between C2 and VSI? Most of the long lasting late depolarization is not related to C2-activity. This prompts the question what these data contribute to the question in focus, i.e. how the weighting between spatially separated excitatory and inhibitory interactions between the C2 and the VSI neuron may contribute to the observed phenomenon.

The second, non-dominant (cryptic as the authors prefer to call it) becomes influential when the first one is removed. One interesting aspect is the large degree of variability observed in the responses to stimulation after the connective (PdN6) is severed or blocked and how that correlates with the inhibitory synaptic strength of the ipsilateral side. Their use of dynamic clamp to demonstrate this relationship is elegant. Overall the work is well done and the figures illustrate their points well. My main concern is with the overall conclusion, namely that the hidden synapse has a special (cryptic) value that is only revealed after disconnecting the two sides. While this may appear to be so, the explanation could more simply be that there is a dominant spike initiation zone in the VSI neuron (the contralateral one). When that zone is eliminated, the other spike initiation zone takes over and it is very variable. Nevertheless, when the nerve is disconnected a large number of excitatory inputs that normally drive the bursting activity are lost and thus the conditions are not comparable. The inhibitory synapse revealed after nerve blockade may be modulated and thus serve a significant role under normal (connected) conditions, which are not elicited under the present experimental conditions. Additionally, the section 'Variation in neural circuits' in the discussion attempts to place the results of this work in the context of animal-to-animal variability recently described in a number of preparations. Given that the concept of animal-to-animal variability refers to the case where various combinations of many (non-linear) components give rise to stable activity, I am not sure I see the connection of that work with the authors'. It seems to me that the present results show a clear relationship between the strength of an inhibitory synapse on VSI neurons with the magnitude of the change in swimming activity observed after nerve disconnection. This effect is simply masked by the stronger (contralateral) synapse."

One interesting aspect is the large degree of variability observed in the responses to stimulation after the connective (PdN6) is severed or blocked and how that correlates with the inhibitory synaptic strength of the ipsilateral side. Their use of dynamic clamp to demonstrate this relationship is elegant. Overall the work is well done and the figures illustrate their points well. My main concern is with the overall conclusion, namely that the hidden synapse has a special (cryptic) value that is only revealed after disconnecting the two sides. While this may appear to be so, the explanation could more simply be that there is a dominant spike initiation zone in the VSI neuron (the contralateral one).
