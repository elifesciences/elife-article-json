Here, we show by genome-wide in vivo ribosome profiling that translation of a restricted subset of mRNAs is induced upon ISR activation. ISRIB substantially reversed the translational effects elicited by phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and induced no major changes in translation or mRNA levels in unstressed cells. eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation-induced stress granule (SG) formation was blocked by ISRIB. Strikingly, ISRIB addition to stressed cells with pre-formed SGs induced their rapid disassembly, liberating mRNAs into the actively translating pool. Restoration of mRNA translation and modulation of SG dynamics may be an effective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, SG formation, and cognitive loss."

Here, we show by genome-wide in vivo ribosome profiling that translation of a restricted subset of mRNAs is induced upon ISR activation. ISRIB substantially reversed the translational effects elicited by phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and induced no major changes in translation or mRNA levels in unstressed cells. eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation-induced stress granule (SG) formation was blocked by ISRIB. Strikingly, ISRIB addition to stressed cells with pre-formed SGs induced their rapid disassembly, liberating mRNAs into the actively translating pool. Restoration of mRNA translation and modulation of SG dynamics may be an effective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, SG formation, and cognitive loss."

The ISR is mediated by diverse stress-sensing kinases that converge on a common target, serine 51 in eukaryotic translation initiation factor alpha (eIF2\u03b1) eliciting both global and gene-specific translational effects (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harding et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wek et al., 2006</a>). Mammalian genomes encode four eIF2\u03b1 kinases that drive this response: PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) is activated by the accumulation of unfolded polypeptides in the lumen of the ER, general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase by amino acid starvation and UV light, protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) by viral infection, and heme-regulated eIF2\u03b1 kinase (HRI) by heme deficiency and redox stress. The eIF2\u03b1 kinase PERK is also part of the unfolded protein response (UPR). This intracellular stress signaling network is comprised of three ER-localized transmembrane sensors, IRE1, ATF6, and PERK, which initiate unique signaling cascades upon sensing an increase in unfolded proteins in the ER lumen (<a href=\"#bib63\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pavitt and Ron, 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "The common mediator of the ISR, eIF2\u03b1, is a subunit of an essential translation initiation factor conserved throughout eukaryotes and archaea. The heterotrimeric eIF2 complex (composed of subunits \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3) brings initiator methionyl tRNA (Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>) to translation initiation complexes and mediates start codon recognition. It binds GTP along with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> to form a ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>) that assembles, along with the 40S ribosomal subunit and several other initiation factors, into the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC). The 43S PIC is recruited to the 5\u2032 methylguanine cap of an mRNA and scans the 5\u2032UTR for an AUG initiation codon (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hinnebusch and Lorsch, 2012</a>). Start site codon recognition triggers GTP hydrolysis and phosphate release, which is followed by release of eIF2 from the 40S subunit, allowing binding of the 60S ribosomal subunit to join. After these events, the elongation phase of protein synthesis ensues. To engage in a new round of initiation, the newly released eIF2 complex has to be re-loaded with GTP, a reaction catalyzed by its dedicated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), the heteropentameric eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B). Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 does not directly affect its function in the PIC, but rather inhibits eIF2B, thereby depleting ternary complex and reducing translation initiation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2001</a>). eIF2B complex is limiting in cells, present in lower abundance than eIF2; a small amount of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 therefore acts as a competitive inhibitor with dramatic effects on eIF2B activity. When eIF2B is inhibited and ternary complex is unavailable, the rate of translation initiation decreases."

These target transcripts include mammalian ATF4 (a cAMP response element binding transcription factor) and CHOP (a pro-apoptotic transcription factor) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harding et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Vattem and Wek, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Palam et al., 2011</a>). ATF4 regulates the transcription of many genes involved in metabolism and nutrient uptake and thus is a major regulator of the transcriptional changes that ensue upon eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and ISR induction (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harding et al., 2003</a>). Although activation of this cellular program can initially mitigate the stress and confer cytoprotection, persistent and severe stress and its associated reduction in protein synthesis and CHOP activation lead to apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tabas and Ron, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lu et al., 2014</a>)."

These effects were studied first using genetics by generating knock-out mice lacking individual eIF2\u03b1 kinases as well as a knock-in of the non-phosphorylatable allele eIF2\u03b1<sup>S51A</sup> (Eif2s1<sup>S51A</sup>). Homozygous loss of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation leads to perinatal death but heterozygous eIF2\u03b1<sup>+/S51A</sup> animals, which have reduced levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, grow into healthy adults showing phenotypes that demonstrate the importance of translation initiation in establishment of long-term memories (<a href=\"#bib53\">Scheuner et al., 2001</a>). Behavioral tests demonstrated that PKR<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>, GCN2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> and eIF2\u03b1<sup>+/S51A</sup> animals display enhanced memory consolidation in learning paradigms of light training (<a href=\"#bib11\">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). Pharmacological modulation of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation represented an important advance, allowing easier discrimination between developmental and acute effects of ISR reduction and circumventing the lethal phenotype of homozygous eIF2\u03b1<sup>S51A/S51A</sup>. Recent work identified small molecules that modulate the ISR pathway at distinct steps: (1) kinase inhibitors that target PERK or PKR (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jammi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Atkins et al., 2013</a>); (2) an activator of HRI (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2011</a>); (3) salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2\u03b1 phosphatases (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boyce et al., 2005</a>); and (4) ISRIB (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sidrauski et al., 2013</a>). By a yet unknown mechanism, ISRIB blunts the effects of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in cells and thus represents the first bona fide ISR inhibitor acting downstream of all eIF2\u03b1 kinases."

We triggered the UPR in HEK293T cells by treating them with tunicamycin (Tm), a toxin that blocks N-linked glycosylation of ER-resident proteins. We chose to analyze an early time point (1 hr) in order to focus on translational changes preceding the extensive transcriptional induction that takes place upon activation of the three branches of the UPR (for a time course of UPR induction, see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> in 10.7554/eLife.00498). After 1 hr of Tm or mock treatment, we added cycloheximide (CHX) to arrest translating ribosomes, lysed the cells, and digested the extract with nuclease to degrade mRNAs not protected by ribosomes. In parallel, we isolated total mRNAs to monitor any changes in mRNA levels. Ribosome profiling data revealed a discrete subset of mRNAs that were translationally up- or down-regulated more than twofold after UPR induction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, above or below box) as seen by changes in abundance of ribosome-protected fragments (RPF) (\u2018Ribo-Seq\u2019, y-axis) without corresponding changes in mRNA levels (\u2018mRNA-Seq\u2019, x-axis).

ISRIB renders cells insensitive to the effects of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, thus leading to the prediction that it prevents SG formation as well. We tested this hypothesis by inducing SG formation using thapsigargin (Tg), a potent ER stressor that inhibits the ER calcium pump and was recently shown by ribosome profiling to yield analogous translational effects to tunicamycin (<a href=\"#bib52\">Reid et al., 2014</a>). Microscopic detection of SGs required a stronger induction of ER stress than commonly achieved with Tm, making Tg the preferred inducer. We monitored SGs by performing immunofluorescence on eIF3a, a translation initiation factor that is recruited into SGs. As expected, we found that ISRIB significantly reduced their assembly upon co-treatment with Tg (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). In addition, ISRIB prevented SG formation induced by arsenite (Ars), another widely used inducer of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation via activation of HRI. As expected, both treatments induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation but only Tg induced the ER-resident kinase, PERK, as seen by its shift in mobility that is due to its extensive auto-phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Both the PERK mobility shift and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation elicited by Tg treatment were blocked by a PERK inhibitor (GSK707800; <a href=\"#bib5\">Axten et al., 2012</a>) but not by ISRIB. Like ISRIB, and as expected by the block in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, the GSK PERK inhibitor prevented SG induction upon Tg addition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

We confirmed that in this cell line ISRIB significantly reduces SG formation driven by stresses that cause eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Tg and Ars) but not by phospho-eIF2\u03b1-independent induction through eIF4A inhibition (Pat A and hippuristanol [Hipp]) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cencic et al., 2012</a>).

This observation as well as other pharmacological and microscopy data revealed that SGs are highly dynamic structures with mRNAs quickly shuttling in and out. When these mRNAs leave SGs, translation is reinitiated; CHX then immobilizes elongating ribosomes and prevents mRNA re-entry into SGs. Because polyribosome disassembly is blocked by CHX yet required for SG assembly, CHX treatment dissolves pre-formed SGs. As seen in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, a 10-min treatment with CHX following Tg induction of SGs (40 min) was sufficient to observe disassembly. Like CHX, ISRIB addition disassembled SGs within 10 min, even in the prolonged presence of the stressor Tg (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Whereas ISRIB restored translation of mRNAs that are liberated from SGs, as seen by the quick recovery in [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine incorporation, CHX further reduced protein synthesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

More recently, we showed by electrical recordings in brain slices that by preventing AMPAR down-regulation in the post-synaptic neuron, ISRIB blocks mGluR-mediated long-term depression (LTD), an effect that is dependent on eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Di Prisco et al., 2014</a>).

These data further support the notion that ISRIB solely inhibits cellular events that are a consequence of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. In agreement with these observations, we previously showed by polyribosome sedimentation analysis that ISRIB does not reverse bulk translational down-regulation triggered by inhibition of CAP-dependent initiation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sidrauski et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, ISRIB treatment alone did not induce overall changes in translation or mRNA levels. Taken together these data demonstrate that ISRIB is a pharmacological agent that acutely and specifically blocks the ISR and is thus an invaluable tool for in vivo studies."

We used this method to monitor translation of all cellular mRNAs upon ISR activation. We found that a limited set of mRNAs is preferentially translated in a substantial manner upon a reduction in ternary complex assembly. Although previous large-scale analyses have revealed that almost 45% of all 5\u2032 UTRs have at least one upstream uORF (<a href=\"#bib8\">Calvo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>), our data revealed that only a few of these mRNAs contain uORFs with regulatory properties that significantly enhance translation of their downstream coding sequences upon eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. The canonical ISR translational targets, ATF4, ATF5, CHOP, and GADD34 mRNAs were significantly induced upon 1 hr treatment with the ER-stressor tunicamycin. The stress-induced, uORF-mediated regulation of GCN4 translation in yeast established the paradigm for this mode of regulation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dever et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Grant et al., 1995</a>). As in mammalian cells, GCN2 is activated in amino acid-starved yeast by the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs, catalyzing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. The transcript encoding GCN4, a bZIP transcription factor with homology to mammalian ATF4, has four uORFs that modulate translation of its coding sequence upon stress. GCN4 induction is thought to occur via a re-scanning mechanism that allows 40S ribosomal subunits to remain mRNA-bound after completing the translation of short reading frames and subsequently reinitiate in the downstream coding sequence after reloading with ternary complex (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hinnebusch, 2005</a>). The select mRNAs that are translationally upregulated in mammalian cells have uORFs that vary in number, length, and distance from the coding sequences. As was observed for GCN4, the uORF2 of ATF4 mRNA showed ribosome density, supporting the notion that it is translated under normal growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>). Whether the same mechanism of rescanning is utilized by all these mRNAs is not known but, like ATF4, their regulation depends on their uORFs (<a href=\"#bib61\">Vattem and Wek, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Palam et al., 2011</a>)."

It belongs to a large family of nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) that are highly conserved transmembrane antiporters localized to the ER or Golgi apparatus (<a href=\"#bib55\">Song, 2013</a>). The role of SLC35A4 in cells is unknown but it may function as the elusive ER-localized UDP-glucose transporter. This hypothesis is particularly attractive in the context of our data because unfolded ER proteins, which trigger the ISR, are continuously de- and re-glucosylated on their N-glycans using UDP-glucose as the glucose donor. Proteins with monoglucosylated N-glycans bind calnexin or calreticulin which promote protein folding. Translational induction of SLC35A4 may thus quickly enhance UDP-glucose transport into the ER lumen upon the accumulation of unfolded proteins in order to promote this pro-folding pathway."

Several of these mRNAs encode for proteins with entirely unknown functions and the remaining targets are involved in a wide range of cellular processes. Whether these ISR-induced translational targets are similarly regulated by the presence of uORFs in their 5\u2032 UTRs remains to be determined with the construction of synthetic translational reporters. ISRIB blocked their differential translation, suggesting that these changes were due to phospho-eIF2\u03b1. There may be additional transcripts that are synthesized later during ISR activation, downstream of the early transcription factor targets such as ATF4, as well as tissue-specific mRNAs that are controlled by phospho-eIF2\u03b1. For example, OPHN1 is a neuron-specific mRNA containing uORFs that is translationally upregulated after mGluR engagement and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and induces LTD. By blocking the effects of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 in cells, ISRIB also blocks mGluR-dependent LTD (<a href=\"#bib16\">Di Prisco et al., 2014</a>). Ribosome profiling of glutamatergic neurons upon ISR induction may reveal additional transcripts whose translational control contributes to the molecular events underlying memory."

Although the decrease in translation of ribosomal proteins and elongation factors upon eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is small in magnitude, its effects on bulk protein synthesis in the cell are significant as these represent a large number of highly expressed proteins. Translation of these mRNAs was previously shown to be under control of mTOR kinase, which regulates mRNA cap-binding factor eIF4E via phosphorylation of inhibitory eIF4E-binding proteins, thereby adjusting protein synthesis in cells in response to the cell's energy and nutrient status (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ma and Blenis, 2009</a>). In this way, mTOR preferentially regulates translation of a group of mRNAs characterized by 5\u2032 TOP motifs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hsieh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Thoreen et al., 2012</a>).

However, ISRIB reversed the translational changes, indicating that they are likely to be downstream consequences of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Thus, if these translational changes do reflect altered mTOR activity, then the change in mTOR signaling must result from reduced translation mediated by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Alternatively, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation may lead to silencing of these mRNAs by recruiting them into SGs. The RNA binding proteins TIA-1 and TIAR, which are prominently SG-associated, were previously shown to bind to TOP mRNAs, leading to their translational downregulation upon amino acid starvation. This effect required both mTOR inhibition and GCN2 activation, the latter resulting in eIF2 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Damgaard and Lykke-Andersen, 2011</a>). SGs also have been shown to recruit signaling molecules including upstream negative regulators of mTORC1 (raptor and DYRK3) and mTORC1 itself, and thus, SG formation may reduce their presence in the cytosol and impede translation of 5\u2032 TOP mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib58\">Thedieck et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wippich et al., 2013</a>)."

A pulse of [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine confirmed the fast recovery in protein synthesis even in the presence of stress. Although the molecular target of ISRIB remains unknown, its quick action suggests a direct effect on translation initiation. Phospho-eIF2\u03b1 resistance has been observed both in yeast and in mammalian cells. In yeast, mutations in eIF2B (the GEF for eIF2) and eIF5 (the 48S PIC-associated GTPase-activating protein for eIF2) have been reported to make cells insensitive to this phosphorylation event (<a href=\"#bib62\">Vazquez de Aldana and Hinnebusch, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pavitt et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">1998</a>). In mammalian cells, TLR4 engagement in macrophages leads to increased eIF2B activity by removal of an inhibitory phosphorylation and insensitivity to ISR activation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Woo et al., 2012</a>). Thus, ISRIB may directly or indirectly enhance the activity of eIF2B, eIF5, or other initiation factors, thus quickly reversing the cellular effects of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1."

These RBPs usually contain several RNA-binding domains and can associate with more than one mRNA; this multi-valency further favors the coalescence of RNA-protein granules. A conspicuous feature of some degenerative diseases is the cytoplasmic or nuclear aggregation of RBPs, driven in some cases by pathogenic mutations. TDP-43 and FUS mutations are found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2013</a>), and mutations in hnRNPA1 and hnRPNPA2/B1 have also been found in ALS (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2013</a>).

The impact of these cytosolic aggregates on SG dynamics is not known, though they may hamper the ability of SGs to properly dissolve, thereby contributing to sustained translational attenuation and neurodegeneration.

The methodology you chose to evaluate the impact on mRNA translation by ribosome profiling and on stress granule formation, by imaging, was likewise deemed appropriate to the task. However, the individual reviews and the consultative process that followed uncovered important problems concerning the interpretability of the data and the validity of the conclusions drawn. These problems are rather pervasive and it will not be possible for the Reviewing editor to decide alone if a revised version would be suited for publication. Thus, if you decide to revise your paper in accordance with the stipulations below, please bear in mind that it will need to be reviewed again by all three reviewers."

The usual translational control models depicted often show an all or nothing extreme response, but it is not surprising at all that there are still ribosomes on uORFs that may get skipped more frequently under stress conditions. Perhaps an important measure of control is the proportion of ribosomes that skip uORF2 in ATF4 and 5. This could be quantified as the Ribo-Seq read data for the overlapping ORF regions should be in separate reading frames. It should be possible to assign reads to either the uORF or the main ORF. As a measure of stress mediated translational control, the authors could quantify the number and proportion of RPF within the ORFs key for translational control.
