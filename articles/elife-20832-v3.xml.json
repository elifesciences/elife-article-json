Binding of initiation factor Rrn3 activates Pol I, fostering recruitment to ribosomal DNA promoters. This fundamental process must be precisely regulated to satisfy cell needs at any time. We present in vivo evidence that, when growth is arrested by nutrient deprivation, cells induce rapid clearance of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes, followed by the assembly of inactive Pol I homodimers. This dual repressive mechanism reverts upon nutrient addition, thus restoring cell growth. Moreover, Pol I dimers also form after inhibition of either ribosome biogenesis or protein synthesis. Our mutational analysis, based on the electron cryomicroscopy structures of monomeric Pol I alone and in complex with Rrn3, underscores the central role of subunits A43 and A14 in the regulation of differential Pol I complexes assembly and subsequent promoter association."

Binding of initiation factor Rrn3 activates Pol I, fostering recruitment to ribosomal DNA promoters. This fundamental process must be precisely regulated to satisfy cell needs at any time. We present in vivo evidence that, when growth is arrested by nutrient deprivation, cells induce rapid clearance of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes, followed by the assembly of inactive Pol I homodimers. This dual repressive mechanism reverts upon nutrient addition, thus restoring cell growth. Moreover, Pol I dimers also form after inhibition of either ribosome biogenesis or protein synthesis. Our mutational analysis, based on the electron cryomicroscopy structures of monomeric Pol I alone and in complex with Rrn3, underscores the central role of subunits A43 and A14 in the regulation of differential Pol I complexes assembly and subsequent promoter association."

Ribosomes are completed by the action of Pol II, synthesizing messenger RNA, and Pol III, involved in 5S rRNA and transfer RNA production. The critical requirement for ribosomes in actively growing cells causes that Pol I retains up to 60% of the total transcriptional activity within the eukaryotic nucleus (<a href=\"#bib52\">Warner, 1999</a>). However, under stress conditions, cells tune down ribosome biosynthesis by repressing Pol I transcription (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mayer et al., 2004</a>). Accordingly, defects in the regulation of this process can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and have been associated with different types of cancer (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bywater et al., 2012</a>)."

While the first three components recognize different regions in promoter DNA, Rrn3 binding to Pol I is a prerequisite for enzyme recruitment to promoter-bound initiation factors (<a href=\"#bib22\">Keener et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Yamamoto et al., 1996</a>). Except for UAF, an equivalent set of proteins plays similar roles in mammals (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hannan et al., 1999</a>), where Rrn3 is also termed TIF-IA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bodem et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Moorefield et al., 2000</a>). The recent electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complex show how these two components interact (<a href=\"#bib11\">Engel et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pilsl et al., 2016</a>), confirming previous biochemical studies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blattner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Peyroche et al., 2000</a>)."

The two largest subunits, A190 and A135, forming the DNA-binding cleft and harbouring the active centre, are held together by the AC40/AC19 assembly heterodimer. Five rather globular subunits present in all nuclear RNA polymerases (Rpb5, Rpb6, Rpb8, Rpb10 and Rpb12) attach on the periphery of the complex. Subunit A12.2 contains a TFIIS-like C-terminal zinc ribbon located next to the active site, while the A49/A34.5 heterodimer attaches on the Pol I lobe through a TFIIF-like dimerization module. Finally, the A43/A14 heterodimer forms a stalk that emerges from the enzyme core."

Additionally, we report the cryo-EM structures of monomeric Pol I alone and in complex with Rrn3 at 4.9 and 7.7 \u00c5 resolution, respectively, representing the two steps in Pol I activation.

                                "text": "To investigate the formation and disruption of Pol I transcription complexes in vivo, we used PICT (Protein interactions from Imaging of Complexes after Translocation), a fluorescence microscopy technique to analyse protein interactions in living cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gallego et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Picco et al., 2017</a>). This technique uses cellular anchoring platforms tagged with both RFP and FK506-binding protein (anchor-RFP-FKBP) to recruit proteins tagged with FKBP-binding domain (bait-FRB). FKBP and FRB strongly interact in the presence of rapamycin, which induces translocation of the bait-FRB to the anchor. If a GFP-tagged protein (prey-GFP) interacts with the bait, it will co-translocate to the anchor upon rapamycin addition, leading to increased co-localization of RFP and GFP signals. Previously-engineered anchors generate a large number of anchors at the plasma membrane, which only allows the\u00a0detection of abundant cytosolic complexes. We designed a new anchor by tagging Tub4, a component of the spindle pole body, with RFP and FKBP (Tub4-RFP-FKBP). The resulting cells harbour only one or two anchors, thus increasing the PICT sensitivity by up to 200-fold (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). In addition, Tub4 is exposed to both the cytosol and the nucleus, which allows detection of complexes on both sides of the nuclear envelope (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The levels of recruitment can be quantified as the co-localization between prey-GFP and anchor-RFP-FKBP (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

                                "text": "To investigate whether Pol I is able to form homodimers in vivo, we constructed a diploid strain where the Pol I subunit A190 was labelled in an allele-specific manner, with one allele tagged to GFP (A190-GFP) and the second to FRB (A190-FRB). The presence of these tags did not alter the doubling times of the cells (101.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.6, 103.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2 and 101.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.3 min for the parental, A190-GFP and A190-FRB strains, respectively). When rapamycin is added, GFP-labelled Pol I will only co-translocate to the anchor-RFP-FKBP if it interacts with FRB-tagged Pol I (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Cells incubated in rich medium present normal growth rate and the vast majority of Pol I accumulates in a sub-nuclear structure likely corresponding to the nucleolus (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Upon rapamycin addition, no recruitment of A190-GFP could be detected at the anchors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). In contrast, when cells were incubated in a medium lacking carbon and nitrogen, hereafter starving medium, their growth was arrested and A190-GFP translocated to the nuclear side of the anchors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Interestingly, the total levels of A190 as well as the distribution of A190-GFP in the anchor vicinity prior to rapamycin addition are equivalent in both media (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D\u2013E</a>). In accordance, the levels of bait recruitment are equivalent in growing and starved cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>). In addition, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments after crosslinking, using a diploid strain where one A190 allele was tagged with TAP (A190-TAP) and the second with MYC (A190-MYC). The former was used for pull-down with IgG resin while the latter was employed for western-blot analysis with anti-MYC antibody. Whole cell extracts (WCE) showed that A190-MYC immunoprecipitation is similar for cells incubated in rich (R) or starving (ST) medium (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>, lanes 1\u20134). Centrifugation of whole cell extracts allowed separation of a soluble fraction (SF) from a chromatin-associated insoluble fraction (Chr F), which were examined independently. Analysis of the soluble fraction showed that Pol I homodimers are only detected in starved cells (lanes 5 and 6). As expected, the chromatin insoluble fraction of growing cells presented high levels of A190-MYC (lane 7), likely corresponding to rDNA-associated Pol I molecules, while tiny amounts of A190-MYC were detected for starved cells (lane 8). DNase I treatment of the latter indicates that this is due to minor levels of Pol I that remains associated with DNA after two hours of starvation (lane 9). The absence of histone H3 in the soluble fraction indicates that there is no contamination from the chromatin insoluble fraction (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>)."

Starved cells exposed to this compound did not show any defect in Pol I homodimerization. Instead, we detect a 40% increase in the homodimers levels with respect to untreated cells. This indicates that no additional protein synthesis is required to induce this cellular event and that ribosome inhibition could reinforce Pol I dimerization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Interestingly, inhibition of protein synthesis in cells grown in non-starving medium was sufficient to induce Pol I dimerization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). When cycloheximide was replaced by diazaborine, an inhibitor of rRNA maturation during 60S formation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Loibl et al., 2014</a>), Pol I dimers were also assembled (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

We used PICT to evaluate whether cells also modulate the levels of this complex according to nutrient availability. We thus constructed a haploid strain expressing anchor-RFP-FKBP, Rrn3 labelled with GFP (Rrn3-GFP) and A190-FRB (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Again, the presence of these tags did not alter the doubling time of the cells (101.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.6 and 100.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.03 min, for the parental and tagged strains). Despite Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes were detected in cells incubated in both rich and starving media, their levels were reduced to about 40% upon nutrient deprivation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Importantly, while starvation does not induce significant changes in the distribution of Rrn3-GFP in the vicinity of the anchor (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), the cellular levels of Rrn3-GFP drop significantly in starved cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). The reduction in Rrn3 and Pol I\u2013Rrn3 correlates with an almost complete deprivation of both Pol I and Rrn3 from rDNA promoters, as observed by ChIP experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>, wt-35S).

For that, we constructed A43\u0394Ct haploid cells that, while expressing similar levels of Rrn3 and A190 to wild-type cells, present reduced growth (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Structural data show that the A43 C-terminal tail is not involved in Rrn3 binding (see below; <a href=\"#bib11\">Engel et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pilsl et al., 2016</a>). Growing A43\u0394Ct cells exhibit levels of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes equivalent to the wild-type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), whereas Pol I promoter association is slightly increased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). A greater increase in Pol I occupancy is observed inside the rDNA gene under growing conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). More interestingly, in starved A43\u0394Ct cells, the levels of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes are about 2-fold higher than those detected in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Furthermore, in these conditions, association of Pol I along the rDNA gene and of Rrn3 at the promoter increase about 6-fold with respect to the wild-type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

ChIP experiments show that the Pol I\u2013Rrn3 chimera is normally associated to rDNA in growing cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). However, under starving conditions, Pol I\u2013Rrn3 association along rDNA is 6 to 7-fold higher than in wild-type cells, a similar behaviour to A43\u0394Ct cells. Moreover, recovery of CARA from nutrient-depleted medium is faster than for wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

When growing cells are transferred to starving medium, detected levels of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 are rapidly depleted by about 30%, in a process that follows an exponential decay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, left). Accordingly, the rate of complex clearance is maximal within the first 15 min, while Pol I homodimers remain undetectable at this stage. In a second stage, disassembly of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes slows down, reaching an additional 10% decrease within the next 20 min (i.e. 40% total reduction when compared to growing cells). During this period, the observed homodimerization follows a sigmoid-like tendency, reaching its fastest assembly rate. After 35 min of starvation, cells enter a third stage where both Pol I\u2013Rrn3 clearance and Pol I homodimerization rates remain slow but constant. Here, detected Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes drop by an additional 20% (i.e. 60% total reduction) while the levels of Pol I homodimers double in amount. A symmetric pattern is observed when starved cells are transferred to nutrient rich medium (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, right). Cells initially respond through rapid assembly of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 during the first 15 min, where detected levels exponentially increase up to 50% of the maximum value in rich medium. Remarkably, changes in the levels of Pol I homodimers are fast as well, leading to 30% reduction in this initial stage. In a second stage, detected Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes remain constant while the clearance rate of Pol I homodimers is maximal, resulting in undetectable levels of Pol I homodimers after 35 min from nutrient addition. From this point, the assembly\u00a0of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes is slowly restored to the level observed in normal growing conditions."

In contrast, restoration of rDNA promoter association follows a linear pattern that is accomplished in about 2 hr (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, right). Western-blot analysis at the same time-points shows that the overall levels of A190 remain constant while those of Rrn3 correlate with detected amounts of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that Rrn3 levels influence the number of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes, as previously proposed (<a href=\"#bib39\">Philippi et al., 2010</a>).

The Pol I stalk appears almost completely disordered, in spite of weak density at the region directly contacting the enzyme core, i.e. the tip domain in subunit A43 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This indicates that the stalk is highly dynamic, which may be important in the Pol I activation process. Additionally, the A12.2 C-terminal Zn-ribbon, the central part of the bridge helix and the DNA-mimicking loop are not visible in our structure, suggesting that these regions are also flexible (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). When compared with the crystal structure of dimeric Pol I (<a href=\"#bib12\">Engel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Tornero et al., 2013</a>), which is essentially identical to dimeric Pol I in solution (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pilsl et al., 2016</a>), our monomeric Pol I structure presents a rearranged cleft entrance where the clamp coiled-coil and the protrusion approach by about 4 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The resulting cleft entrance is 38 \u00c5 in width, which leaves enough room for double stranded DNA to access the bottom of the cleft. While further cleft closure is required to reach a transcription-competent state (<a href=\"#bib36\">Neyer et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tafur et al., 2016</a>), the cleft in monomeric Pol I is about half way from inactive dimeric to elongating Pol I. Additionally, the dimer to monomer transition affects several other domains in Pol I, including movement of the jaw towards the clamp core, as well as the\u00a0opening of the foot and associated subunit Rpb5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

The elongated Rrn3 molecule binds on the concave face of a valley formed by the stalk and the dock domain in subunit A190, and extends further to reach the AC40/AC19 heterodimer at the back of the enzyme. Interestingly, Rrn3 binding fixes the Pol I stalk with respect to free monomeric Pol I, thus generating a surface for interaction with promoter-bound initiation factors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Apart from stalk ordering, the conformation of the enzyme in the Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complex is virtually identical to that of monomeric Pol I, indicating that conformational changes are not associated with Rrn3 binding. Comparison of our cryo-EM reconstruction with the reported structures (<a href=\"#bib11\">Engel et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pilsl et al., 2016</a>) shows minor differences such as flexibility of the A12.2 C-terminal Zn ribbon and a slightly shifted orientation of Rrn3 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which reveals a certain degree of plasticity in the complex."

The central part of Rrn3 contacts both the stalk-binding domain in subunit A135 and the dock domain in subunit A190 at Pol I-specific insertions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Finally, the C-terminal third of Rrn3 contacts subunit AC19 and the AC40 C-terminus, in agreement with data showing that K329 in AC40 crosslinks K558 in Rrn3 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blattner et al., 2011</a>)."

Based on our cryo-EM structure, we engineered several A14 mutants to assess their role in complex formation and promoter association. We first took advantage of the fact that cells lacking this subunit are viable to produce a knockout mutant (\u0394A14). In agreement with cryo-EM data, \u0394A14 cells exhibit a 75% decrease in Pol I\u2013Rrn3 as compared to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). A similar decrease in promoter association for both components of the complex was measured by ChIP. Moreover, this strain presents a growth defect but the levels of several Pol I subunits including A43 and those of Rrn3 are unaffected (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results indicate that A14 plays a role in Pol I association to rDNA. We then produced specific deletions of different A14 structural elements that, according to our cryo-EM structure, lie in the vicinity of Rrn3 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). As in the case of \u0394A14, cells expressing these mutations present similar levels of A190 and Rrn3 to wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). A strain lacking the C-terminal tail (A14\u0394Ct, \u0394101\u2013137) presents similar levels of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 and promoter association as wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>), indicating that the A14 C-terminal tail is not involved in Rrn3 binding. In accordance, this mutant exhibits normal growth (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, a strain that also lacks helix \u03b12 of the TA domain (A14\u25b3\u03b12Ct, \u039480\u2013137) presents about one third reduction in detected Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels and promoter association (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). While less intense, this resembles the behaviour of \u0394A14, also at the growth level (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, we generated an A14 point mutant at arginine 91 (A14-R91E) exhibiting a reduction in detected levels of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 and in promoter association that is comparable to that observed for \u0394A14 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>), while growth is less affected (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Our A14 mutational analysis indicates that helix \u03b12 is fundamental for Rrn3 binding and subsequent promoter association."

Strikingly, this mutant behaves opposite to \u0394A14 and helix \u03b12 mutants, as it shows a 2-fold increase in detected Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). In accordance, we observe a 3- and 1.5-fold increase in promoter association for Pol I and Rrn3, respectively, while growth is not affected (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). When cells expressing A14\u0394TAloop were cultured under starving conditions, the Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels are about double of the wild-type, while detected Pol I homodimers and promoter occupancy of Pol I and Rrn3 remain unaffected (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This suggests that the TA-loop in A14 has a role in limiting binding to Rrn3. These data also show that higher levels of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 are not sufficient to influence Pol I homodimerization or promoter dissociation in starved cells."

However, Pol I can also form homodimers that are incompetent for transcription, yet this assembly could only be observed in vitro (<a href=\"#bib12\">Engel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Tornero et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Milkereit et al., 1997</a>). While we were unable to detect Pol I dimers in growing cells, nutrient depletion induced enzyme homodimerization. Moreover, these dimers also form after inhibition of either rRNA maturation with diazaborine or protein synthesis with cycloheximide. While these three processes are mechanistically different, they all negatively affect events that are downstream of Pol I transcription. It is therefore likely that, when rRNA synthesis has to be reduced, transcriptionally disengaged Pol I molecules form inactive dimers. This peculiar mechanism implies two major advantages. On one hand, the formation of compact homodimers could protect a pool of this highly-abundant enzyme from degradation, thus saving energy to the cell. On the other hand, upon restoration of favourable conditions, rRNA synthesis can be reactivated, while de novo Pol I production would delay the process, especially if few ribosomes are available. Finally, although we cannot exclude that Pol II or Pol III could homodimerize in conditions other than nutrient starvation, our results suggest that homodimerization is not a general mechanism to regulate eukaryotic transcription."

We show that nutrient depletion induces a rapid reduction in the levels of Pol I\u2013Rrn3, which correlates in time with a marked decrease in the\u00a0promoter association of both Pol I and Rrn3. We also show that promoter dissociation is strongly reduced in a strain where Pol I is permanently attached to Rrn3. This suggests an influence of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels in rDNA transcription. However, the levels of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 as such are not sufficient to account for transcription inactivation by nutrient depletion, as Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes can be detected regardless of null promoter levels of A190 and Rrn3. This is in agreement with previous observations of rDNA transcription inactivation by inhibition of TOR signalling (<a href=\"#bib39\">Philippi et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, our A43\u0394Ct mutant, which specifically impairs Pol I homodimerization, shows that this mechanism also contributes to inactivate Pol I transcription in response to nutrient deprivation. Therefore, both Pol I\u2013Rrn3 and Pol I dimerization modulate rDNA transcription, which allows us to propose a model (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). When nutrients are depleted, Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels and promoter association drop exponentially whereas Pol I only homodimerizes subsequently. Remarkably, 20 min after starvation, Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels remain relatively high in spite of marginal amounts of promoter association. We thus hypothesize that, in addition to Pol I\u2013Rrn3 disassembly, additional regulatory mechanisms may contribute to initial transcriptional inactivation. At a later stage, Pol I homodimerization remains a major factor limiting transcription. Upon refeeding from starvation, we propose that available Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes are rapidly recruited for transcription, while disruption of Pol I homodimers provides fresh Pol I that can interact with Rrn3 to increase Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes and further activate rDNA transcription."

The A43 C-terminal tail is conserved from yeast to human, arguing for a Pol I monomer/dimer modulation of rRNA synthesis in higher eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beckou\u00ebt et al., 2011</a>). Nevertheless, there are organisms lacking the A43 C-terminal tail, such as <i>S. pombe</i> and <i>A. thaliana</i>, where likely no Pol I dimerization will take place in nutrient-arrested cells. Additionally, our cryo-EM structure shows that the main Pol I element involved in Rrn3 interaction is the OB domain in the A43 elongated core. This is consistent with reported data in yeast (<a href=\"#bib38\">Peyroche et al., 2000</a>) and with the identification of an OB peptide that can bind Rrn3 in human (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rothblum et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, our structure points towards a contact between a serine cradle in A43 and a serine patch in Rrn3. In agreement, it was shown that this interaction can only take place if Pol I is phosphorylated and Rrn3 is not (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fath et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gerber et al., 2008</a>)."

When A14 is deleted, both Rrn3 binding and promoter association of both Pol I and Rrn3 are severely impaired. A similar behaviour can be obtained by either deletion of the last 58 residues in subunit A14 or the A14-R91E point mutant. This suggests that A14, and helix \u03b12 in particular, plays an important role in Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complex formation, as suggested by cryo-EM data. Furthermore, the TA-loop, which is disordered in the dimeric Pol I crystal structure, is involved in limiting Rrn3 binding to Pol I. Deletion of this region leads to a strong increase in both Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complex formation and its association with the rDNA promoter in growing cells. Genetic studies in <i>S. pombe</i> implicated the A14 homolog in Rrn3 binding (<a href=\"#bib21\">Imazawa et al., 2005</a>), supporting that our A14 observations may be extended to other organisms."

Contact of the activating factor with these three regions is therefore required for activation and subsequent binding to promoter-attached initiation factors. In the Pol II system, the Mediator complex acts as an activating cofactor required for association of\u00a0the\u00a0enzyme to promoter-bound initiation factors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 1994</a>). Interestingly, the Pol II\u2013Mediator structure shows that the coactivator contacts the enzyme at the stalk, the dock domain, and the AC40/AC19 homolog (<a href=\"#bib42\">Plaschka et al., 2015</a>). While other details of the enzyme-cofactor interaction differ between both transcription systems (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), the described similarities suggest that the interaction of activating factors with the stalk and surrounding regions might help bring RNA polymerases to the promoter. Additionally, in spite of significant differences with bacterial transcription, the \u03c3 factor may also be regarded as an activator, as its binding is required for promoter association. Fitting of the bacterial holoenzyme structure into our cryo-EM map shows that domain 4 of the \u03c3 factor (<span class=\"underline\">\u03c3</span><sup>4</sup>) falls in the region where Rrn3 is located and contacts equivalent domains of the RNA polymerase core (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Moreover,\u00a0\u03c3<sup>4</sup>\u00a0binds the bacterial promoter DNA (<a href=\"#bib35\">Murakami et al., 2002</a>) and mammalian Rrn3 was shown to interact with the rDNA promoter (<a href=\"#bib47\">Stepanchick et al., 2013</a>). These analogies suggest that an overall architectural arrangement may be conserved to mediate enzyme activation and promoter recruitment."

For analysis, strains were grown in YPD medium at 30\u00b0C overnight, then diluted and grown up to exponential phase in synthetic complete (SC) medium. Cells attached to 35 mm glass bottom culture dishes coated with Concanavalin A were incubated for 2 hr at 30\u00b0C in either SC-Low Fluorescence medium (lacking folic acid and riboflavine) or the same medium without nitrogen and glucose. Where indicated, 10 \u03bcM rapamycin was also added, either alone or together with 0.2 \u00b5g/ml cycloheximide or 10 \u00b5g/ml diazaborine. Images were acquired on an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with 100x/1.30 objective lens, a Hamamatsu Orca-ER camera, and two complete fluorescence filter cubes from AHF respectively optimized for GFP (ET Bandpass 470/40 + Beamsplitter 500DVXRUV + ET Bandpass 525/50) and RFP (ET Bandpass 545/30 + Beamsplitter 580 DVXRUV + BrightLine HC 617/73). All strains were analyzed in three biological replicates, where each sample was imaged in at least 6 fields of view close to the equatorial section of the cells. The acquisition of both fluorescence channels was performed sequentially by switching the filter cubes. The software ImageJ (<a href=\"http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/\">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</a>) was used to analyze the images and a custom image analysis workflow was developed and implemented in ImageJ macro language to enable the automatic processing of complete data sets. This workflow independently processes RFP (red) and GFP (green) channels to segment spot like structures of a specific size in the images; the functional steps (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) are identical for both channels but the settings are slightly different to adapt to the difference in image quality. The recruitment score is defined as the ratio of (i) the summed area of all segmented prey-GFP spots overlapping with segmented RFP-anchors multiplied by the mean GFP intensity measured inside this region, to (ii) the summed area of all segmented RFP-anchors. The overall recruitment score for a condition is hence a measurement performed over tens of small image regions coming from all the images of a given replica. The segmentation of RFP-anchors is almost flawless since the signal to noise ratio is very high for this channel. Prey-GFP spots are more challenging to segment due to their lower contrast and the presence of a strong but smoothly varying background signal, still the results are reasonably good thanks to the pre-filtering and local thresholding adapted to the expected spots geometry, and the automatic validation of the segmented particles based on their geometry (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, from the recruitment score definition, only false positive prey-GFP spots overlapping with RFP-anchors do actually count toward the recruitment score; since anchors are sparsely located, and are virtually segmented flawlessly, this only happens very marginally. Finally, no condition specific increase in GFP signal background intensity could be detected by our control experiments (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Overall, the recruitment score is hence highly reproducible, which is backed by the low standard deviations observed across the three biological replicates of each condition."

For Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complex preparation, the enzyme was dialyzed against GF Buffer and incubated with Rrn3 in a 1:1 molar ratio on ice for 16 hr. The sample was cross-linked with 0.16% glutaraldehyde for 5 min on ice and subsequently quenched with 25 mM Tris pH 8.3,\u00a0200 mM glycine. This sample was injected in a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion column equilibrated in EM buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl). The quality of the crosslinked sample was assessed by SDS-PAGE, native gel electrophoresis and LC-ESI MS/MS. For Rrn3 antibody labelling in the context of the Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complex, Pol I was incubated with Rrn3 in a 1:1 molar ratio overnight at 4\u00b0C in GF buffer, supplemented with HEPES up to 110 mM. The sample was crosslinked by incubation with 0.48% glutaraldehyde for 5 min on ice and then\u00a0quenched with 25 mM Tris pH 8.3, 200 mM glycine. The StrepMab-Immo antibody (IBA, Germany) was then added to form the Pol I\u2013Rrn3\u2013antibody complex (1:1:1.5 molar ratio). The mixture was loaded in a Superose 6 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in GF1 buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 85 mM Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 3 mM DTT) to isolate the complex of interest from the free antibody and crosslinking aggregates."

Reference-free averages were obtained using EMAN, while 3D reconstructions were carried out using protocols implemented in Xmipp (<a href=\"#bib44\">Scheres et al., 2008</a>). The correctness of the final structures was supported by the high correlation between 2D projections of the models and reference-free averages.

Two rounds of reference-free 2D class averaging allowed removal of bad particles, yielding a stack of 190,750 good-quality images. A negative-staining reconstruction of free Pol I was low-pass filtered at 60 \u00c5 and used as starting model to sort the images using 3D classification. Particles were split into six classes with T\u00a0=\u00a04, an offset search range of 6 pixels, and offset search steps of 2 pixels. Only one class containing a total of 32,175 images clearly showed density for both Pol I and Rrn3, while a second class with 90,173 particles corresponds to monomeric Pol I. Both particle sets were subjected to 3D refinement including particle polishing and post-processing, which yielded maps for monomeric Pol I and Pol I\u2013Rrn3 with final resolutions of 5.6 and 7.7 \u00c5, respectively, according to the gold-standard FSC\u00a0=\u00a00.143.

Introducing an improvement in the PICT assay, they provide the first evidence that Pol I forms homodimers in cells, in a manner that depends on nutrient starvation or inhibition of either translation or ribosome biogenesis using drugs. The dimerization requires the C-terminal domain of subunit A43, implicated in dimerization by the previous crystal structure of a Pol I dimer. They could also use the PICT assay to monitor Pol I:Rrn3 complex levels and show that these are down-regulated in starved cells, although not to the same extent as promoter occupancy of these proteins measured by ChIP. They examine the kinetics of formation/dissociation of the Pol I dimer and Pol I:Rrn3 complexes by PICT in the transition from growth to starvation and back to growth, which are complex and multiphasic and show that at least to some extent the two processes are not tightly coupled in time. They then switch gears and present two cryo-EM structures, a Pol I::Rrn3 complex at 7.7 \u00c5 resolution, which appears similar in most important respects to a higher resolution structure (4.8 \u00c5) of the same complex recently published by another group; and a Pol I monomer at 4.9 \u00c5, of higher resolution than one also published this year. Comparison of their Pol I monomer to the crystallized dimer gives some insights into the transition from the presumably inactive dimer to active monomer, but these transitions were either not dramatic or were not well explained in the text/figures. The Pol I:Rrn3 complex is highly relevant to Pol I activation and they go on to perform a limited structure-function analysis of this interaction, showing that it is impaired if the A14 subunit (which interacts extensively with Rrn3) is simply deleted from Pol I. The Pol I:Rrn3 complex assembly and recruitment are either diminished or enhanced if the unstructured C-terminal tail of A43 is removed or the internal unstructured \"TA-loop\" of A14 is removed, respectively. The effect of deleting A14 entirely could be indirect, as it also interacts extensively with A43; and the opposing effects of deleting A43-CTT or A14 TA-loop, while interesting, are difficult to rationalize because they are unstructured segments that don't make known contacts with Rrn3."

All three reviewers had difficulty understanding how the PICT results have been quantified; Rev. #2 had the most serious concerns, and has explained the difficulties thoroughly in his/her review. The large halo of background GFP signal compared to the small amount associated with the tethered RFP makes quantification of the co-localizing PICT signal highly questionable; and the images in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a> raise doubts about whether the degree of co-localization of the anchor and Pol I-GFP signals can be reliably measured. The PICT homodimerization data seem to indicate that only a small fraction of the Pol I exists in homodimers, and the Pol-Rrn3 PICT data indicate only a modest reduction in this complex (which might merely reflect reduced Rrn3 abundance) despite a strong loss of Rrn3/Pol I occupancy of the RDN promoter measured by ChIP. The analysis of the kinetics of forming/dissociating these complexes by PICT do not indicate tight coordination of Pol-Rrn3 dissociation and homodimer formation, and provide no evidence that homodimerization is driving dissociation of Pol I-Rrn3 complexes. The rates of forming/dissociating these complexes measured by PICT are quite slow and have not been compared to the rates of Rrn3/Pol I association/dissociation from the promoter measured by ChIP. As such, formation/dissociation of these protein complexes may be secondary to the key events that regulate promoter occupancy at much higher rates. In addition, the conclusions that inactive ribosomes trigger Pol I dimerization are not substantiated by the data and represent an overinterpretation of the data. Thus, while the PICT assay might be providing evidence for Pol I dimerization in cells that is triggered by nutrient starvation, provided the criticisms raised by Rev. #2 can be satisfied, it is unclear that dimerization is extensive enough and occurs with the proper kinetics to represent an important mechanism for down-regulating Pol I function, as opposed to a secondary event that might simply protect idle Pol I molecules from degradation. One way to support your claim would be to construct a mutation in the A43-CTT that specifically impairs homodimerization and show that this mutation abolishes homodimerization by PICT and also dampens loss of Pol 1:Rrn3 promoter complexes in starved cells measured by ChIP."

First, they could formaldehyde crosslink under the various in vivo situation and do a co-IP with essentially the same constructs they already have. Second, they could replace the targeting tags with Gal4, which would allow Gal4-Pol I fusions to targeted to Gal4 binding sites (assayed by ChIP). If the model is correct, one should see the non-Gal4 version of Pol I associating with Gal4 binding sites under starvation. Both of these approaches might be better for kinetics and quantification, but the real virtue of them is that they are independent assays for dimerization."

This paper uses the PICT assay to provide convincing evidence that Pol I homodimers can form in cells, but only in stress conditions including starvation for carbon and nitrogen, arrest of translation elongation by cycloheximide, or treatment with a drug shown to impair ribosome biogenesis. The evidence that homodimerization occurs in cells is firm, and the fact that it was observed only in starved/stressed cells supports its role as a regulatory mechanism for inactivation of Pol I under conditions where new ribosome synthesis is unwanted. Unfortunately, however, there is no direct evidence establishing its importance in down-regulating Pol I function. In fact, the kinetics of homodimerization versus PolI:Rrn3 interaction shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> reveal that the initial, and most rapid phase of dissociation of Pol I:Rrn3 on the shift from growth to starvation precedes any appreciable formation of Pol I dimers, and hence, is clearly not being driven, at least initially, by dimerization. What is needed in my view is a mutation that specifically impairs homodimerization, such as in the A43-CTT, and to show that this mutation would dampen the loss of Pol 1:Rrn3 complexes from promoter DNA in starved cells, thereby showing that dimerization is an important component of the down-regulation of Pol I recruitment/transcription. Unfortunately, the mutation they examined that simply deletes the entire A43-CT has the complication of also, inexplicably, impairing Pol I:Rrn3 interaction and promoter recruitment. Thus, a more surgical mutational approach would be needed to achieve this important goal."

The higher resolution of their monomeric Pol I compared to that recently published by another group, should allow a superior comparison between the monomeric and dimer Pol I (from the crystal structure), from which they conclude that the transition from dimer to monomer \"involves partial cleft closure and increased flexibility of critical motifs\". However, the relevant figure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) does not make a convincing case for the cleft closure in the monomer, and the accompanying text (subsection \u201cCryo-EM structures of monomeric Pol I alone and in complex with Rrn3\u201d) did not help much to convince me. In addition, it seems possible that the critical motifs are flexible in both the monomer and dimer but were fixed in the dimer by crystal contacts."

It is even possible that the steady state level of Pol I is reduced by the A14 deletion and contributes to the reduced yield of Pol I:Rrn3 interactions and Pol I recruitment. Thus, the effects of the A14 subunit deletion on Pol I integrity and abundance should have been examined. But even more importantly, the authors should have used the molecular details of the cryoEM structure to more surgically disrupt the A14:Rrn3 interaction by truncating or substituting helix 2 of A14 in a way designed not to disrupt A14 interactions with other Pol I subunits.

The cryoEM structures are valuable, but a Pol I:Rrn3 complex of higher resolution was already published. The structure-function analysis of A43 and A14 did not exploit the cryoEM structure, as it involved deletions of large segments that are not present at their interfaces with Rrn3. The result that deleting the TA loop in A14 leads to greater Pol I:Rrn3 association and promoter occupancy is the most interesting finding, but the molecular mechanism is not obvious from the structure. Taken together, the paper is not a strong candidate for <i>eLife</i>, even if the authors can address all of the shortcomings in the experiments and interpretations mentioned above or below."

Why this halo forms is not discussed, and since no marker of the nuclear space is provided it is also very unclear what is being observed. The GFP halo around the RFP signal, very prominent in both wt/wt and A43\u0394Ct/A43\u0394Ct but present in most images throughout the manuscript, appears to make even a rough estimate of RFP-GFP co-localization near impossible. The quantitation protocol used (Materials and methods) makes no attempt to take this GFP halo into account as a (non co-localizing) background fluorescence. The problem is clearly demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, where the background level of GFP even in these test examples is at least as large and often many times the co-localizing signal.

The large halo of background GFP signal compared to the small amount associated with the tethered RFP makes quantification of the co-localizing PICT signal highly questionable; and the images in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a> raise doubts about whether the degree of co-localization of the anchor and Pol I-GFP signals can be reliably measured. The PICT homodimerization data seem to indicate that only a small fraction of the Pol I exists in homodimers, and the Pol-Rrn3 PICT data indicate only a modest reduction in this complex (which might merely reflect reduced Rrn3 abundance) despite a strong loss of Rrn3/Pol I occupancy of the RDN promoter measured by ChIP. The analysis of the kinetics of forming/dissociating these complexes by PICT do not indicate tight coordination of Pol-Rrn3 dissociation and homodimer formation, and provide no evidence that homodimerization is driving dissociation of Pol I-Rrn3 complexes. The rates of forming/dissociating these complexes measured by PICT are quite slow and have not been compared to the rates of Rrn3/Pol I association/dissociation from the promoter measured by ChIP. As such, formation/dissociation of these protein complexes may be secondary to the key events that regulate promoter occupancy at much higher rates. In addition, the conclusions that inactive ribosomes trigger Pol I dimerization are not substantiated by the data and represent an overinterpretation of the data. Thus, while the PICT assay might be providing evidence for Pol I dimerization in cells that is triggered by nutrient starvation, provided the criticisms raised by Rev. #2 can be satisfied, it is unclear that dimerization is extensive enough and occurs with the proper kinetics to represent an important mechanism for down-regulating Pol I function, as opposed to a secondary event that might simply protect idle Pol I molecules from degradation. One way to support your claim would be to construct a mutation in the A43-CTT that specifically impairs homodimerization and show that this mutation abolishes homodimerization by PICT and also dampens loss of Pol 1:Rrn3 promoter complexes in starved cells measured by ChIP.</i>"

We agree that quantifying the recruitment to the anchoring platform is not trivial and that the GFP halo around the anchor further complicates this quantification. Nonetheless, our image analysis protocol allows for specific segmentation of the GFP signal recruited to the anchoring platforms, regardless of the background. We agree that images used to illustrate the PICT assays through the manuscript conveyed the false impression that the intensity of the GFP halo varies among the different conditions. The negligible effect of the GFP halo in the detection of Pol I complexes and computation of the recruitment score is extensively discussed in the comments to reviewer 2."

To support our claim that homodimerization influences Pol I transcription, we designed a new mutant (A43\u0394Ct, \u0394307-326) that specifically abolishes Pol I ability to homodimerize (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). Upon starvation, this strain presents higher levels of Pol I and Rrn3 associated to rDNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Nonetheless, these levels remain lower than in growing cells, indicating that another mechanism also contributes to inactivate Pol I transcription (see specific response to reviewer 1). In addition, we measured promoter association of A190 and Rrn3 along two hours after cells were deprived from nutrients (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Our results show that full promoter dissociation occurs with comparable dynamics as Pol I\u2013Rrn3 disassembly, i.e. within 2 hours from starvation. Moreover, we studied the behavior of a chimeric strain where Rrn3 and A43 are covalently fused (Laferte et al., 2006), so that no free monomeric or dimeric Pol I can form. ChIP data show higher association levels of A190 than the wild-type along the entire rDNA gene (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that, in the absence of Pol I dimers and increased Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels, rDNA transcription is upregulated in starved cells. The fact that we detect Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes in the wild-type strain when promoter association is null (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>), suggests that Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels alone are not enough to drive transcription inactivation in starved cells. A TA-loop mutant that specifically increases Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels without affecting promoter association in starving conditions further supports this. As this mutant also presents unperturbed levels of Pol I dimers, it confirms the observation from time-course PICT that assembly/disassembly of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 does not drive Pol I dimerization. Finally, we have also more accurately interpreted our data on Pol I dimerization upon drug treatment, as explained in detail for reviewer 1. To account for all these results, we modified the main text at different sections (see specific sections in responses to reviewer 1). Moreover, to better express the conclusions of our work, we modified the manuscript title, as also suggested by the Editor (see below)."

We detect tiny amounts of Pol I dimers in the chromatin fraction of starving cells, probably as a result of some protein contamination from the soluble fraction, as suggested by the presence of low levels of Pgk1 in this fraction (panel B), or due to minor amounts of Pol I still attached to DNA after two hours of starvation.

This paper uses the PICT assay to provide convincing evidence that Pol I homodimers can form in cells, but only in stress conditions including starvation for carbon and nitrogen, arrest of translation elongation by cycloheximide, or treatment with a drug shown to impair ribosome biogenesis. The evidence that homodimerization occurs in cells is firm, and the fact that it was observed only in starved/stressed cells supports its role as a regulatory mechanism for inactivation of Pol I under conditions where new ribosome synthesis is unwanted. Unfortunately, however, there is no direct evidence establishing its importance in down-regulating Pol I function. In fact, the kinetics of homodimerization versus PolI:Rrn3 interaction shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> reveal that the initial, and most rapid phase of dissociation of Pol I:Rrn3 on the shift from growth to starvation precedes any appreciable formation of Pol I dimers, and hence, is clearly not being driven, at least initially, by dimerization. What is needed in my view is a mutation that specifically impairs homodimerization, such as in the A43-CTT, and to show that this mutation would dampen the loss of Pol 1:Rrn3 complexes from promoter DNA in starved cells, thereby showing that dimerization is an important component of the down-regulation of Pol I recruitment/transcription. Unfortunately, the mutation they examined that simply deletes the entire A43-CT has the complication of also, inexplicably, impairing Pol I:Rrn3 interaction and promoter recruitment. Thus, a more surgical mutational approach would be needed to achieve this important goal.</i>"

As the reviewer pointed out, the levels of Rrn3 drop upon starvation. This suggests that degradation of Rrn3 might be a mechanism that the cell employs to regulate Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels during the first stages of starvation. We performed western-blots of Rrn3 and A190 at different time points (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although upon starvation the levels of Rrn3 roughly correlate with those of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 as detected by PICT, in the reverse transition the levels of Rrn3 recover steadily while Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels follow a different dynamic that partially correlates with Pol I homodimer disassembly. Moreover, the A14\u25b3TAloop mutant presents higher levels of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 while western-blot shows that Rrn3 levels are unaltered respect to the wild-type. Therefore, Rrn3 degradation might be an important mechanism to regulate Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels during the first stages upon starvation, but not in cells starved for longer times. Similarly, upon re-feeding, synthesis of fresh Rrn3 likely plays an important role to control Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels, but this is not sufficient to explain the dynamics observed, which suggest that Pol I homodimers disassembly might also contribute to activate transcription, as supported by the novel A43\u0394Ct mutant described above. In summary, we conclude that Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels are an important regulatory mechanism of Pol I activation in growing cells and during the first minutes upon starvation, but in cells starved for longer times they are not sufficient to determine rDNA transcription.

The result that deleting the TA loop in A14 leads to greater Pol I:Rrn3 association and promoter occupancy is the most interesting finding, but the molecular mechanism is not obvious from the structure. Taken together, the paper is not a strong candidate for eLife, even if the authors can address all of the shortcomings in the experiments and interpretations mentioned above or below.</i>"

Using the A14\u0394TAloop, which exhibits a 2-fold increment in Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels in starving conditions, we could not detect any change in Pol I dimerization compared to the WT (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

As mentioned, we have further exploited our Pol I\u2013Rrn3 structure to design mutants that show the biological relevance of subunit A14. Helix-\u03b12 mutants specifically disrupt Pol I\u2013Rrn3 assembly and show that Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes are required for proper Pol I activation in growing cells. Moreover, cells expressing a mutated form of A14 lacking the TA-loop, show higher levels of Pol I\u2013Rrn3, both in growing and starved cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Since Rrn3 and A190 levels are equivalent to WT cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), this confirms the role of the TA-loop in regulating Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels independently of total Rrn3 levels. In addition, ChIP experiments show that in growing cells higher levels of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 are enough to strength the activation of Pol I. However, under starvation higher Pol I\u2013Rrn3 assembly is not enough to increase the recruitment of Pol I to the promoter. These results indicate that levels of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 regulate Pol I activation in growing cells but are not sufficient for inactivation after long nutrient depletion. Interestingly, our more surgical A43\u0394Ct mutant (\u0394307-326), which specifically impairs Pol I dimerization, dampens loss of Pol I and Rrn3 at the promoter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). This shows that Pol I homodimerization in starved cells contributes to down-regulate Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels and subsequent recruitment to rDNA. Thus, we propose that the cell uses homodimerization to down regulate Pol I in starved cells."

Upon re-feeding, rDNA association follows a linear behavior, different to the dynamics of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 assembly.

Because performing ChIP experiments at many time points is very challenging, we chose time points that cover the different stages observed in complex assembly by PICT. Our results show that rDNA promoter association of Pol I and Rrn3 extinguishes and recovers with kinetics in the same time scale as changes observed in the levels of Pol I homodimers and Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes detected by PICT. Upon nutrient deprivation, promoter association drops exponentially and correlates with changes in Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels. The rate curve resembles that of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 clearance, but the latter only reaches 40% of the initial value, in accordance with the overall levels of Rrn3 as shown by western-blot. This is in agreement with the experiments of A14 mutants and the Rrn3-A43 fusion strain (see above). Altogether, the data show that Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels influence Pol I activation in growing cells and during the first minutes upon starvation, but they are not sufficient to regulate Pol I inactivation in long-term starved cells. Upon nutrient re-supplementation, promoter association increases steadily while Pol I\u2013Rrn3 formation follows different dynamics, where Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels grow at an early stage, remain constant during a second stage and then increase again up to growing levels. This suggests that Pol I homodimers represent a rapid enzyme supply to generate Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes. This is supported by the observation that cells where Pol I homodimerization is impaired (new A43\u0394Ct mutant) present higher levels of Pol I and Rrn3 at the promoter and of the former within the gene. This mutant also suggests that in cells starved for 2 hours, Pol I homodimerization accounts for about 60% of Pol I inactivation, according to Pol I promoter.

Further, the ChIP measurement of PolI and Rrn3 recruitment at the gene promoter reduces by over 80% in starved cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and is not consistent with the only 50% reduction in PolI-Rrn3 estimated by PICT. (To be reliable the ChIP data should be extended to other amplicons both within and outside of the 35S transcribed region to show that the reduction in promoter signal is not due to chromatin accessibility changes after nutrient depletion, etc.) As is, the data provided suggest that the reduction in transcription on nutrient withdrawal is not due either to dissociation of the PolI-Rrn3 complex or the formation of inactive PolI dimers.</i>"

This suggests that Pol I homodimerization plays an essential role in inactivation of rDNA transcription. In conclusion, we have tuned-down our claims and now state that both Pol I homodimers and Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes modulate rDNA transcription."

Our results show that A190 associates with the chromatin all along the transcribed region and the rDNA promoter, while Rrn3 levels are only high at the promoter region for the wild-type strain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). However, our ChIP analysis of mutant strains indicates that changes in chromatin accessibility after nutrient depletion do not explain the reduction in Pol I and Rrn3 promoter association. For instance, in the Rrn3-A43 fusion strain, A190 can be localized associated within the 35S rDNA gene under starving conditions at significantly higher levels than in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A similar behavior can be observed for the new A43\u0394Ct mutant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

The PolI dimer signal might be rising on nutrient withdrawal and falling on refeeding, but we have no idea how much of PolI is undergoing this change. This is particularly clear from the refeeding data, where dimers appear to be rapidly eliminated, but PolI-Rrn3 complexes hardly increase over the same time period.</i>"

As mentioned above, we have now included time-course ChIP experiments showing that, upon refeeding, Pol I is rapidly associated to promoters to activate transcription. Thus, in spite of an increment in the assembly of Pol I\u2013Rrn3 complexes, these will also rapidly disassemble as a result of rRNA synthesis. Therefore, Pol I\u2013Rrn3 levels as seen by PICT are not expected to rise until Pol I\u2013Rrn3 assembly is faster than Pol I incorporation to rDNA, which we observe only at the later stages of recovery from starvation. The absolute quantification of Pol I dimer copies goes beyond the scope of this study. Nonetheless, our novel A43\u0394Ct mutant shows that Pol I homodimerization is responsible for about 60% of Pol I inhibition in cells starved for 2 hours, highlighting the relevance of this regulatory mechanism."

Later papers started misusing holoenzyme to mean the Mediator \u2013 pol II complex. For similar reasons, I don't think Rrn3-pol I would qualify as a holoenzyme.
