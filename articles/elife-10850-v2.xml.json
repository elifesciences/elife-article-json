                    "text": "During meiosis, crossover recombination is essential to link homologous chromosomes and drive faithful chromosome segregation. Crossover recombination is non-random across the genome, and centromere-proximal crossovers are associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy, including Trisomy 21 in humans. Here, we identify the conserved Ctf19/CCAN kinetochore sub-complex as a major factor that minimizes potentially deleterious centromere-proximal crossovers in budding yeast. We uncover multi-layered suppression of pericentromeric recombination by the Ctf19 complex, operating across distinct chromosomal distances. The Ctf19 complex prevents meiotic DNA break formation, the initiating event of recombination, proximal to the centromere. The Ctf19 complex independently drives the enrichment of cohesin throughout the broader pericentromere to suppress crossovers, but not DNA breaks. This non-canonical role of the kinetochore in defining a chromosome domain that is refractory to crossovers adds a new layer of functionality by which the kinetochore prevents the incidence of chromosome segregation errors that generate aneuploid gametes."

Crossover recombination is non-random across the genome, and centromere-proximal crossovers are associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy, including Trisomy 21 in humans. Here, we identify the conserved Ctf19/CCAN kinetochore sub-complex as a major factor that minimizes potentially deleterious centromere-proximal crossovers in budding yeast. We uncover multi-layered suppression of pericentromeric recombination by the Ctf19 complex, operating across distinct chromosomal distances. The Ctf19 complex prevents meiotic DNA break formation, the initiating event of recombination, proximal to the centromere. The Ctf19 complex independently drives the enrichment of cohesin throughout the broader pericentromere to suppress crossovers, but not DNA breaks. This non-canonical role of the kinetochore in defining a chromosome domain that is refractory to crossovers adds a new layer of functionality by which the kinetochore prevents the incidence of chromosome segregation errors that generate aneuploid gametes."

Point centromeres are defined by a short ~125bp sequence upon which the kinetochore assembles, while regional centromeres are typically comprised of specialized centromeric chromatin interspersed with blocks of heterochromatin. In fission yeast and <i>Drosophila</i>, the integrity of pericentromeric heterochromatin was found to repress double-strand\u00a0break\u00a0(DSB) formation and centromere-proximal recombination (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ellermeier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Westphal and Reuter, 2002</a>).

Moreover, pericentromeric CO suppression has been observed in situations where centromere position is uncoupled from its associated heterochromatin, such as in <i>Drosophila</i> strains carrying translocated chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mather, 1939</a>).

Within kinetochores, multiple generally conserved sub-complexes can be recognized that perform specific roles. Outer kinetochore sub-complexes together form an interface with microtubules and serve as a platform for spindle assembly checkpoint signaling, coupling chromosome-microtubule interactions with cell cycle progression. Inner kinetochore sub-complexes direct assembly of the outer kinetochore. Several kinetochore subcomplexes together assemble into a Constitutive Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN;\u00a0also known as the Ctf19 complex in budding yeast) (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib44\">McAinsh and Meraldi (2011)</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Westermann and Schleiffer (2013)</a>) As its name implies, the CCAN/Ctf19 complex is bound to centromeric chromatin throughout the mitotic or meiotic cell division program. In meiotic G2/prophase of budding yeast, when recombination occurs, only the Ctf19 and Mis12/MIND (<span class=\"underline\">M</span>tw1 <span class=\"underline\">i</span>ncluding <span class=\"underline\">N</span>nf1-Nsl1-<span class=\"underline\">D</span>sn1) kinetochore complexes are bound to the centromere (<a href=\"#bib45\">Meyer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Miller et al., 2012</a>). The Ctf19 complex exerts long range effects by promoting cohesin enrichment throughout the ~20\u201350\u00a0kb surrounding pericentromere despite being restricted to the core ~125\u00a0bp centromere sequence (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eckert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fernius and Marston, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ng et al., 2009</a>). It does so by targeting the Scc2/4 cohesin loader to the centromere, from where cohesin spreads into the pericentromere (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fernius et al., 2013</a>). These characteristics make the Ctf19 complex a particularly good candidate for mediating kinetochore-derived recombination suppression. Here we show that both cohesin-independent suppression of DSB formation and cohesin-dependent repair pathway choice underlie a central role for the Ctf19 complex in suppression of CO\u00a0formation in the pericentromere."

This method allows the detection of CO and non-crossover (NCO) repair products (i.e. gene conversions), which can inform on altered regulation of meiotic DNA break repair (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Poor spore viability (typically &lt;30%) precluded us from using Ctf19 complex deletion mutants.

Nevertheless, the observed effect of <i>pCLB2-3HA-IML3\u00a0</i>on pericentromeric recombination was greater than <i>sgs1</i>\u25b3 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>), which is known to affect meiotic recombination near centromeres (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rockmill et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Oke et al., 2014</a>). Together, these experiments demonstrate that the Ctf19 complex shapes the meiotic recombination landscape by minimizing pericentromeric CO recombination."

                                "text": "We next addressed how the Ctf19 complex prevents pericentromeric COs and NCOs. All meiotic recombination events begin with the programmed introduction of DSBs by the topoisomerase-related protein Spo11 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Keeney et al., 1997</a>). DSBs form throughout the genome, but are strongly repressed within ~3\u00a0kb of budding yeast centromeres (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buhler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pan et al., 2011</a>). We generated genome-wide DSB maps of the <i>mcm21</i>\u25b3 mutant by high-throughput sequencing of oligonucleotides that remain covalently bound to Spo11 as a by-product of DSB processing (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pan et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Interestingly, increased centromere-proximal DSBs were detected in the <i>mcm21</i>\u25b3 mutant compared with wild type, revealing a general role for the Ctf19 complex in suppression of pericentromeric DSBs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Pericentromeric DSBs in the <i>mcm21</i>\u25b3 mutant reached a level\u00a0similar to the genome average (dotted lines, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), indicating that there is no residual DSB suppression in the absence of Mcm21. Strikingly, the increase in DSBs occurred over a narrower domain (~3\u00a0kb on each side of the centromere, i.e. a total region of ~6\u00a0kb) than CO formation (~20 kb each side of the centromere, ~40\u00a0kb in total; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>), indicating that suppression of COs at centromeres is not solely due to a reduction in DSB levels. To compare the effect on DSBs and COs more directly, we examined DSB formation in the intervals on chromosome <i>VIII</i> analyzed in the live cell recombination assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). As expected, we observed an increase in DSBs within the same pericentromeric interval in which we measured CO frequency using the live cell reporter assay. However, DSBs were increased only ~5-fold over wild type in <i>mcm21</i>\u25b3 within this region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), while we observed an ~21-fold increase in COs within the same region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Therefore, the increase in DSBs can only account for approximately 24% of the increase in pericentromeric COs."

The variability in susceptibility of the different pericentromeres to DSBs is likely explained by their underlying features, since it is well-established that DSB formation is influenced by chromatin and genome organization (e.g.\u00a0the availability of gene promoters that serve as a preferred target of Spo11 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pan et al., 2011</a>)). Chromosome\u00a0<i>I\u00a0</i>in particular, showed emergence of a very prominent DSB hotspot in a promoter region immediately adjacent to the centromere\u00a0(<i>CEN1</i>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We exploited the appearance of this hotspot to monitor ectopic DSBs close to centromeres by Southern blotting in the repair-deficient <i>dmc1</i>\u25b3 background, where DSBs persist. Close to <i>CEN1,\u00a0</i>DSBs\u00a0were detected in the absence of Mcm21<sup>CENP-O</sup> or Ctf19 <sup>CENP-P</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Importantly, DSBs that formed near <i>CEN1</i> in the absence of Mcm21<sup>CENP-O</sup> or Ctf19 <sup>CENP-P</sup> were dependent on the catalytic activity of Spo11, demonstrating that these were genuine programmed DSBs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Screening additional Ctf19 complex subunits showed a striking correlation between increased DSB formation at <i>CEN1</i> and increased CO formation as measured in our live cell recombination reporter assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Interestingly, depletion of the MIND complex component, Dsn1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) also resulted in the appearance of <i>CEN1</i>-proximal DSBs, suggesting that the overall integrity of the kinetochore might be generally important for repressing DSB formation within pericentromeres. In conclusion, one likely mechanism by which the Ctf19 complex prevents pericentromeric recombination is via the inhibition of DSB formation close to centromeres."

This enrichment provides the basis for robust sister chromatid cohesion, the establishment of which is coupled to DNA replication in S-phase (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eckert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fernius and Marston, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fernius et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hinshaw et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ng et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998</a>). Pericentromeric enrichment of the meiotic cohesin subunit, Rec8, at G2/prophase I also depended on the Ctf19 complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). Since cohesin has been implicated in influencing meiotic DNA break formation and repair (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ellermeier and Smith, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Klein et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kugou et al., 2009</a>), we used the live cell recombination reporter assay to test the requirement for cohesin in preventing pericentromeric COs. To prevent pleiotropic phenotypes and sporulation failure associated with total cohesin loss in meiosis, we employed a mutation in the Scc4 subunit of the cohesin loader (<i>scc4-m35</i>), which in vegetative cells specifically abolishes pericentromeric cohesin enrichment (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hinshaw et al., 2015</a>). In meiotic prophase, Rec8 levels were indeed reduced at centromeric and pericentromeric sites in <i>scc4-m35\u00a0</i>cells. However, chromosomal arm sites were also affected (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), suggesting that the <i>scc4-m35</i> mutations might influence cohesin loading at non-centromeric sites during meiosis. Nevertheless, <i>scc4-m35\u00a0</i>cells underwent meiosis to produce spores, analysis of which revealed an increased frequency of pericentromeric (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), but not chromosomal arm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>) COs, though this increase was more modest than in the absence of Ctf19 complex subunits (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). This finding supports the notion that pericentromeric cohesin enrichment by the Ctf19 complex contributes to the suppression of centromere-proximal COs."

                                "text": "We next asked whether the Ctf19 complex influences DSB patterns near centromeres by acting before and during S-phase, when it is known to promote the pericentromeric enrichment of cohesin. To test this, we used the \u201canchor away\u201d system to selectively and conditionally deplete Ctf19 from the nucleus after S-phase (via timed addition of rapamycin (<a href=\"#bib26\">Haruki et al., 2008</a>); <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We reasoned that anchoring away Ctf19 before S phase (t=0) would prevent pericentromeric cohesin establishment, similar to a <i>ctf19</i>\u25b3 strain\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib42\">Marston et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fernius et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, because cohesin establishment is coupled to DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib70\">Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998</a>), addition of rapamycin after S phase (t=3) would allow cohesion establishment, thereby allowing us to test cohesin-independent functions of the Ctf19 complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). First, we confirmed the\u00a0successful removal of Ctf19-Frb-GFP from the centromere by addition\u00a0of rapamycin either before (t=0) or after (t=3) DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Next, we examined the effect on centromeric cohesin. Rec8 chromatin immunoprecipitation\u00a0(ChIP) in prophase I cells revealed that centromeric cohesin levels were more greatly reduced by anchoring away Ctf19 before (t=0\u2009h) rather than after DNA replication (t=3\u2009h) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Because this assay does not allow cohesin loaded before or after DNA replication to be distinguished, we sought to test the functionality of pericentromeric cohesin in the two conditions. Since only functional cohesin is expected to be retained at centromeres during anaphase I (<a href=\"#bib34\">Klein et al., 1999</a>), we examined Rec8 on chromosome spreads in binucleate cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). Although centromeric Rec8 was detected in only 4% of binucleate cells where Ctf19 was anchored away before DNA replication (Rapa t=0), centromeric Rec8 was observed in 48% of binucleate cells where Ctf19 was anchored away after DNA replication (Rapa t=3) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Therefore, the presence of Ctf19 before and during S phase allows for the establishment of functional pericentromeric cohesin. Having established conditions that allowed us to uncouple pericentromeric cohesin establishment from post-S phase functions of the Ctf19 complex, we asked whether the role of the Ctf19 complex in suppressing pericentromeric DSBs is linked to its role in cohesin establishment during S phase. As expected, anchoring away Ctf19 before (Rapa t=0) DNA replication led to the appearance of <i>CEN1-</i>proximal DSBs with comparable timing and intensity to those of <i>ctf19</i>\u25b3 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013I</a>). DSBs were also observed following rapamycin addition at 3\u00a0hr, i.e. after DNA replication\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). This suggests that the Ctf19 complex is required throughout meiotic prophase to prevent pericentromeric DSB formation and that it does so in a manner independent of its role in cohesin establishment."

Consistent with our findings above, <i>CEN1-</i>proximal DSBs were not observed in <i>rec8</i>\u25b3 or <i>scc4-m35\u00a0</i>cells, unless a Ctf19 complex component (Mcm21<sup>CENP-O</sup>) was also absent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J,K</a>). Thus, DSB inhibition near centromeres does not depend on cohesin, but requires the continuous presence of the Ctf19 complex. These findings provide an explanation for our observation that Ctf19 complex mutants exhibit a higher frequency of pericentromeric COs than <i>scc4-m35\u00a0</i>mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), despite a comparable reduction in pericentromeric cohesin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). Loss of <i>MCM21</i> relieved DSB suppression over a domain (~6\u00a0kb; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) that is much larger than the 125\u00a0bp where the kinetochore resides but smaller than the cohesin-rich pericentromere (~20\u00a0kb; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We therefore speculate that the large multi-subunit Ctf19 complex may exert DSB suppression near centromeres by altering local chromosome structure such that accessibility of DSB-promoting factors is prevented."

If this is the case, DSBs arising after DNA replication and pericentromeric cohesion establishment would not be expected to give rise to pericentromeric COs. To test this idea, we anchored away Ctf19 either before (t=0) or after (t=3) DNA replication, both of which induce <i>CEN1-</i>proximal DSBs soon thereafter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>) and measured CO formation using the live cell reporter assay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L</a>). Anchoring Ctf19 away before DNA replication (t=0) increased pericentromeric COs to a similar extent to <i>ctf19</i>\u25b3 cells (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L</a>), as expected. However, anchoring Ctf19 away after DNA replication (t=3) led to a more modest increase in pericentromeric COs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L</a>), despite comparable levels of DNA break formation in these cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H,I</a>). Therefore, pericentromeric cohesin acts at a step after DSB formation to direct repair, probably through a pathway avoiding the homolog, to ensure CO suppression near centromeres. Because the cohesin complex is known to promote inter-sister recombination in mitosis and meiosis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Covo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ellermeier and Smith, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Klein et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kugou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sjogren and Nasmyth, 2001</a>) the simplest explanation is that increased pericentromeric cohesin shunts meiotic DSBs into inter-sister-specific recombinational repair, although we cannot rule out pericentromere-specific, cohesin-dependent activation of alternative repair pathways."

Because Zip1, like cohesin (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kim et al., 2010</a>) has been suggested to confer a bias on DSBs to be repaired from the sister chromatid, rather than the homolog, and because loss of Zip1 increases pericentromeric COs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), but not DSBs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we reasoned that a critical role of pericentromeric cohesin might be Zip1 recruitment. Consistently, ChIP-qPCR indicated that Zip1 localization was impaired in <i>scc4-m35</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and Ctf19 complex mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Furthermore, analysis of spread meiotic chromosomes revealed that the \u201cdotty\u201d Zip1 localization pattern, representative of centromeres, was rarely observed in Ctf19 complex mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Unexpectedly, \u201cfull\u201d Zip1 localization along chromosomes was also impaired in Ctf19 complex mutants. Although the underlying reasons for this are currently unclear, possible explanations are delayed G2/prophase progression and/or a requirement for pericentromeric Zip1 in producing the \u201cfull\u201d Zip1 tracts observed in cytological analyses. Nevertheless, ChIP-Seq of prophase I-arrested cells confirmed that Ctf19 complex components are specifically required for Zip1 association with core centromeres and the pericentromere (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013F</a>). We measured comparable pericentromeric CO frequencies of 2.4 and 2.0 cM in <i>scc4-m35\u00a0</i>and <i>zip1</i>\u25b3 cells, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>) suggesting that pericentromeric cohesin establishment by the Ctf19 complex directs Zip1 association to suppress pericentromeric COs, although we do not rule out Zip1-independent functions of cohesin in CO suppression."

On a global scale, the assembly of a meiotic chromosome axis dictates the spatial distribution of the meiotic DSB machinery along chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kim et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kugou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>). On a smaller scale, genome organization and histone modifications have been shown to allow Spo11 activity (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib16\">de Massy (2013)</a>). Spo11-dependent DSB formation is strongly associated with chromatin regions that are enriched for histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation (reviewed in\u00a0<a href=\"#bib16\">de Massy (2013)</a>) and in budding yeast, these modifications are found near transcriptional start sites (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tischfield and Keeney, 2012</a>)). Indeed, within the budding yeast genome, Spo11 prefers to cleave DNA in open, nucleosome-free regions that are most often found in active, divergent promoters (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pan et al., 2011</a>)."

                                "text": "Superimposed on these global determinants of the DSB landscape are specific and spatial controls, which create zones of inhibition within at-risk genomic regions such as telomeres, repetitive DNA arrays and centromeres (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib16\">de Massy (2013)</a>). We find that the kinetochore actively minimizes DSB formation within a region of ~6\u00a0kb, surrounding all budding yeast centromeres. The underlying genome organization of these regions is not obviously different from the rest of the genome, harboring a similar density of genes and regulatory elements, which would ordinarily be expected to contain several DSB-permissive regions, were they not located close to a centromere. Indeed, in the absence of the Ctf19 kinetochore sub-complex, DSB formation is strongly increased, and these DSBs have features typical of preferred DSB sites genome-wide. Accordingly, one of the strongest pericentromeric DSBs that we identified here, at <i>CEN1</i>, falls within a divergent promoter (of the genes <i>TFC3</i> and <i>NUP60;\u00a0</i><a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The Ctf19 complex suppresses DSB formation surrounding all centromeres, though to different extents depending on the chromosome (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that it overcomes the intrinsic features of the chromatin organization in the pericentromere to dampen DSB activity. This could be achieved by locally shaping a higher order chromosome organization and/or by influencing the recruitment of meiotic chromosome axis components. Intriguingly, the chromosomal region protected from DSBs (~6\u00a0kb) extends far beyond the binding of the Ctf19 complex, which is restricted to the 125 bp point centromere, as defined by the assembly of a nucleosome containing the centromere-specific histone variant Cse4<sup>CENP-A</sup> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Biggins, 2013</a>). Therefore, the Ctf19 complex protects a region about 50 times larger than that occupied by the centromeric nucleosome from DSBs, suggesting that the effect is not merely due to a local disturbance of Cse4<sup>CENP-A</sup>. A precedent for the idea that the Ctf19 complex can exert long-range effects on the pericentromere through its role in driving cohesin loading at the centromere to enrich the surrounding 20\u201350\u00a0kb is well-documented (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eckert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fernius and Marston, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fernius et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ng et al., 2013</a>). However, we found that the Ctf19 complex must prevent DSB formation independently of its role in promoting cohesin enrichment within pericentromeres. Cohesin enrichment was neither sufficient nor required to prevent DSBs near <i>CEN1</i>. Furthermore, DSB suppression acts on shorter chromosomal distances (~6 kb), than the ~20\u201350 kb sized regions within which the Ctf19 complex influences cohesin recruitment. Taken together, these findings suggest the existence of an additional, distinct Ctf19 complex-dependent effect on meiotic DSB formation within regions adjacent to centromeres. By analogy to the effect on pericentromeric cohesin enrichment, we speculate that the Ctf19 complex may enable the centromeric recruitment of factors that alter chromatin organization in the surrounding region."

Thus, DSBs that occur within the pericentromeric regions when high levels of cohesion are present are shunted away from inter-homologous recombinational repair (that eventually can yield a CO or NCO). Taking into account the established roles for cohesin in promoting inter-sister repair (<a href=\"#bib15\">Covo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ellermeier and Smith, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Klein et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kugou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sjogren and Nasmyth, 2001</a>), we consider it is most likely that these breaks will preferentially be repaired using the sister chromatid as a repair template."

One possibility is that high levels of cohesin turn the sister chromatid within pericentromeres into a preferred repair template. Indeed, it has been shown that template choice (sister or homologue) for DSB repair during budding yeast vegetative growth is dictated by the levels of cohesin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Covo et al., 2010</a>). Globally, on meiotic chromosomes, repair of DSBs is normally biased towards use of the homologous chromosome instead of the sister chromatid to ensure at least one COs is formed to link each homolog pair (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hollingsworth, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Humphryes and Hochwagen, 2014</a>). In budding yeast, this homologue bias is established by the Red1/Hop1/Mek1 signaling axis (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kim et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Niu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Niu et al., 2005</a>). This signaling pathway is thought to locally antagonize cohesin to enable the use of the more distant homologous chromosome as a repair template (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kim et al., 2010</a>). Potentially, the Red1/Hop1/Mek1 system is not capable of counteracting cohesin within pericentromeres, where much higher levels of cohesin are present as compared to elsewhere in the genome. Alternatively, one could envision that, within pericentromeric regions, Red1/Hop1/Mek1 are incapacitated via active inhibition or removal."

We found that proper recruitment of Zip1 to the pericentromere requires the Ctf19 complex and kinetochore-targeted Scc2/4, consistent with previous studies demonstrating a requirement for cohesin in Zip1 recruitment (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chuong and Dawson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brar et al., 2009</a>). Zip1 performs specific functions at centromeres during prophase, which include non-homologous centromere-coupling (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tsubouchi and Roeder, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tsubouchi et al., 2008</a>), repression of pericentromeric CO formation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2008</a>) and the bi-orientation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gladstone et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Newnham et al., 2010</a>).

During meiosis, in addition to the canonical events that also take place during mitosis, the kinetochore takes on additional roles to bring about the specialized segregation pattern. First, sister chromatids need to attach to microtubules that emanate from the same pole in a mono-oriented fashion. Second, sister chromatid cohesion at pericentromeres needs to be protected from removal during meiosis I. In both cases, the kinetochore controls these events by coordinating the recruitment of specific protein complexes (i.e. monopolin and Sgo1/PP2A, respectively) (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib17\">Duro and Marston (2015)</a>). Our data add a hitherto unknown, additional level of functionality to the kinetochore in meiosis, in which it impacts meiosis-specific CO formation by influencing both meiotic DSB formation and recombinational break repair. As such, it effectively prevents the formation of unwanted chiasma within pericentromeres. Finally, we note that our data might also provide an additional rationale for why much higher cohesin levels need to be established around centromeres, namely to minimise CO formation near centromeres."

It would be interesting to examine the role of the MIND complex in CO suppression, however, there are considerable technical difficulties with doing so and this is beyond the scope of the current study. MIND is known to be essential for kinetochore-microtubule attachments and, consistent with this, depletion of its Mtw1 and Dsn1 components during meiosis led to a near-complete failure in chromosome segregation with very few tetranucleate cells being produced (this data is now included as <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since measurement of CO frequency relies on the production of spores, we were unable to assay CO suppression in these strains.We were, however, able to examine DSBs at <i>CEN1</i> by Southern blotting. We found that Dsn1 is also required for suppression of DSBs, suggesting the integrity of the kinetochore might be generally important for DSB suppression. This data is now included in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and referred to in the last paragraph of the subsection \u201cThe Ctf19 complex inhibits centromere-proximal DNA breaks\u201d."

Conversely, Mcm21 was retained at centromeres in Dsn1 cells and appears elevated in Mtw1-depleted cells, despite massive chromosome mis-segregation in these cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests a partial and complex inter-dependence of the Ctf19 and MIND complexes at the kinetochore. The finding that Dsn1 is at least partially localized in <i>mcm21</i>\u25b3 cells is consistent with the fact that nuclear division occurs in <i>mcm21</i>\u25b3 but not <i>pCLB2-DSN1</i> cells and suggests that the Ctf19 complex functions at least partially independent of the MIND complex in CO suppression.

The shown southern analysis and quantification is a representative experiment; a similar experiment was performed that demonstrated comparable effects on DSB intensities and anchoring away of a different Ctf19 complex, Iml3 showed a similar effect on DSB formation.

Previous work in vegetatively growing cells (Fernius and Marston, 2009) demonstrated that the Ctf19 complex is important for the timely recruitment of cohesin to centromeres (i.e. before S phase), so that it can be converted to functional cohesin (i.e. cohesin that supports sister chromatid cohesion), which requires DNA replication, as previously demonstrated (Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998). In the absence of the Ctf19 complex, cohesin presumably moves from other (chromosome arm) loading sites to the centromere, but does not become functional because it arrives after the replication fork has already passed. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that only in the case where Ctf19 is present as cells undergo replication (i.e. rapamycin addition at t=3) would functional cohesin be built, while addition of rapamycin before DNA replication (t=0) would preclude functional cohesion establishment. During anaphase I, functional pericentromeric cohesin is protected from separase cleavage and can be observed at centromeres on chromosome spreads. As a measure of the functionalityof cohesin, we therefore performed chromosome spreads to visualize Rec8 in binucleate cells after release from a prophase I block after anchoring away Ctf19 at either t=0 or t=3. This data (now included in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E, F</a>) clearly shows an increase in pericentromeric cohesin in binucleate cells treated with rapamycin at t=3, compared to those treated at t=0. We have also extensively re-written this section more carefully explaining our rationale for clarity (subsection \u201cPericentromeric cohesin shields against CO repair of centromere-proximal DSBs\u201d, second paragraph). Together with the quantification of DSBs (see point 4 above) and the finding that cohesin (<i>rec8</i>\u25b3 and <i>scc4-m35</i>) mutants do not relieve DSB suppression, we believe there is now strong evidence that the Ctf19 complex suppresses DSBs independently of cohesin."

We suggest that the lower percentage of cells with full length Zip1 staining along chromosomes is simply due to a reduction of Zip1 enrichment in the centromeric region, leading to the \u201cdiscontinuous\u201d appearance. Ctf19 complex mutants also exhibit a delay in meiotic G2/prophase which potentially exacerbates this effect. Furthermore, our Zip1 ChIP-Seq analysis revealed the strongest concentration of Zip1 at the centromere in wild type cells and a clear reduction in centromeric Zip1 in <i>mcm21</i>\u25b3 and <i>iml3</i>\u25b3 mutants. In contrast, chromosomal arm Zip1 does not appear to be grossly affected by deletion of <i>MCM21</i> or <i>IML3</i> in the ChIP-Seq or ChIP-qPCR analysis (with the exception of the <i>ctf19</i>\u25b3 mutant, for reasons that are unclear). Furthermore, previous work has established the centromere as the initiation site for chromosome synapsis (Tsubouchi et al., 2008 Genes Dev), yet the importance of this initiation site to the \u201cfull\u201d Zip1 tracts typical of wild type cells has not, to our knowledge, been tested. Taken together, our Zip1 ChIP-Seq and chromosome spreading data indicate that initial Zip1 loading at the centromere may be important for robust Zip1 tracts along entire chromosomes. While indeed interesting, we feel that further investigation of the role of the kinetochore in synaptonemal assembly is beyond the scope of the current study but have added a couple of sentences highlighting this observation in the first paragraph of the subsection \u201cZip1 prevents pericentromeric COs and promotes centromere pairing through separate mechanisms\u201d."
