However, studies of single cell development have largely been conducted in fixed or pre-twitching live embryos, because of technical difficulties associated with embryo movement in late embryogenesis. We present open-source untwisting and annotation software (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" href=\"http://mipav.cit.nih.gov/plugin_jws/mipav_worm_plugin.php\">http://mipav.cit.nih.gov/plugin_jws/mipav_worm_plugin.php</ext-link>) that allows the investigation of neurodevelopmental events in late embryogenesis and apply it to track the 3D positions of seam cell nuclei, neurons, and neurites in multiple elongating embryos. We also provide a tutorial describing how to use the software (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) and a detailed description of the untwisting algorithm (Appendix). The detailed positional information we obtained enabled us to develop a composite model showing movement of these cells and neurites in an 'average' worm embryo. The untwisting and cell tracking capabilities of our method provide a foundation on which to catalog <i>C. elegans</i> neurodevelopment, allowing interrogation of developmental events in previously inaccessible periods of embryogenesis."

For some volumes annotation information was not captured, usually due to errors in the untwisting process; for these volumes the spreadsheet entries are left blank. Additionally, there is unconstrained rotation around the midline in most datasets, which can cause X and Y-values to switch between positive and negative sign. The canonical orientation of the embryo for this paper is for cells on the right side (R) of the animal to have positive X-values and Y-positions located dorsal to the midline to have positive values; in volumes where the XR values are negative the sign should be changed, as well as the corresponding sign for the YR, XL, and YL values for that volume. Z-measurements are insensitive to this rotation. All annotations are in \u03bcm."

However, studies of single cell development have largely been conducted in fixed or pre-twitching live embryos, because of technical difficulties associated with embryo movement in late embryogenesis. We present open-source untwisting and annotation software (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" href=\"http://mipav.cit.nih.gov/plugin_jws/mipav_worm_plugin.php\">http://mipav.cit.nih.gov/plugin_jws/mipav_worm_plugin.php</ext-link>) that allows the investigation of neurodevelopmental events in late embryogenesis and apply it to track the 3D positions of seam cell nuclei, neurons, and neurites in multiple elongating embryos. We also provide a tutorial describing how to use the software (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) and a detailed description of the untwisting algorithm (Appendix). The detailed positional information we obtained enabled us to develop a composite model showing movement of these cells and neurites in an 'average' worm embryo. The untwisting and cell tracking capabilities of our method provide a foundation on which to catalog <i>C. elegans</i> neurodevelopment, allowing interrogation of developmental events in previously inaccessible periods of embryogenesis."

In addition to the untwisting capability, our plugin includes the ability to annotate and track 3D positions over time, allowing semi-automated quantification of cell and neurite positions in twisted (and untwisted) embryos.

We find that seam cell nuclear positions are highly stereotyped across different embryos, while the rate of elongation varies according to position along the embryo. Of the neurons we examined, ALA and AIY move in concert with neighboring seam cell nuclei, suggesting they are passively 'dragged' with the rest of the elongating worm embryo, while the CAN neurons actively migrate at a faster rate than the surrounding seam cell nuclei. Tracking ALA neurites reveals that anterior-posterior\u00a0neurite outgrowth starts toward the end of elongation and continues after cells reach their final positions. Our method is the first to track cell positions in the context of the entire embryo, from the beginning of twitching until hatching. We anticipate that our software will significantly further the ability to examine <i>C. elegans</i> development in the post-twitching regime and lay a foundation for understanding the formation of the <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system."

The resulting lattice is used to generate a 3D model of the worm volume (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). In cases where automated lattice-building fails, lattices can be built manually by marking the positions of seam cell nuclei, nose, bends in the embryo, and tail.

To generate a straightened volume, the voxels in the original image that intersect with the sampling planes in the worm model are captured, and the sampling planes and associated voxels are concatenated in the head-to-tail direction to generate a straightened volume (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

The user adds annotations similarly to lattice points, marking the volume location where the desired point should appear.

We first examined overall morphological changes in the nematode embryo. Embryos lengthened (from 86 \u00b1 5 \u00b5m at early 1.5-fold, measured from the nose to the tail, to 162 \u00b1 19 \u00b5m within the last 30 min before hatching, measured from the nose to the last pair of seam cells, mean \u00b1 standard\u00a0deviation\u00a0[SD], 5 embryos) and narrowed in width (measured diameter across the widest cross-section 22 \u00b1 1 \u00b5m at early timepoints, and 16 \u00b1 1 \u00b5m at late timepoints, mean \u00b1 SD, 5 embryos) as they progressed from comma stage to late-3 fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). We used our software to manually annotate and extract the positional trajectories of seam cell nuclei during this time period, as they moved relative to the nose of the animal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J\u20133L</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We note that seam cell V5 divides late in the threefold embryo into Q and V5 daughters; in such cases, we tracked the anteriormost daughter, Q, and thus refer to V5 as Q/V5 in our paper. The motion of seam cell nuclei followed relatively simple trends that were easily evident, despite the noise present in the raw untwisted trajectories. During elongation, seam cell nuclei moved laterally (\u2018X\u2019 motion, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>) towards the midline, while maintaining a relatively fixed dorso-ventral position (\u2018Y\u2019 motion, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). Along the axial, head-to-tail axis, the displacement of seam cell nuclei was biphasic, showing a fast, approximately linear dependence on time, followed by a slower plateau (\u2018Z\u2019 motion, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Priess and Hirsh, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chin-Sang and Chisholm, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ding et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Norman and Moerman, 2002</a>). While embryo elongation has been examined before\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Priess and Hirsh, 1986</a>), our method is the first that allows 3D interrogation of whole, live, untwisted nematodes at arbitrary timepoints in embryogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

Of the three-parameter fits, the three-parameter logistic provides the best overall fit, both from visual inspection and quantitatively (lowest SSR, AIC, and SC scores). The four-parameter Morgan Mercer Flodin and Logistic curves show slightly better qualitative fits, especially at early time points, but require careful tuning of the initial parameters to converge.

We note that the choice of fitting functions is somewhat arbitrary. For axial positions, the growth that we and others\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Priess and Hirsh, 1986</a>) have observed leads to a sigmoidal fitting function. Amongst the various three-parameter sigmoidal functions (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), we found that the three-parameter logistic function gave the best qualitative and quantitative (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) agreement with the data. We fitted lateral (\u2018X\u2019) seam cell nuclei positions with a two parameter power law function, and dorso-ventral (\u2018Y\u2019) positions with a linear function, as empirically these functions described our data well. Despite the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of these fits, we found that fitted values were within 1.5 \u00b5m of the X, Y averaged data, and within 7.5 \u00b5m of the Z averaged data (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>).

Since we fixed the nose as the stationary origin in our untwisting procedure, this location does not move in 4D representations of the fitted embryo. In this 'nose-centric' reference frame, points further from the origin also appear to move faster and farther than points closer to the origin. To better understand the growth rates of individual seam cell nuclei in relation to their neighbors, and the overall length changes within the elongating embryo in a frame-independent manner, we also computed the differences in position between adjacent pairs of nearest-neighbor seam cell nuclei over time (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 dimensions, seam cell nuclei exhibited similar movement patterns, remaining largely stationary in \u2018Y\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and moving inwards (toward the origin) in \u2018X\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) at similar rates. In contrast, seam cell nuclei movement along the \u2018Z\u2019 direction was more heterogeneous. For example, the distance between the origin and nuclei of seam cell pair H0, measured from the fitted data, changed from 2.4 \u00b5m to 23.8 \u00b5m over elongation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), while the distance between seam cell nuclear pairs V6 and T remained essentially constant, at 22.5 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus, the rate of increase in distance between the origin and H0 was significantly greater than the increase in distance between V6 and T, over the same period. Other adjacent nuclear pairs separated at roughly similar rates from start to end of elongation (these pairs increased in distance 6.8 \u00b1 2.8 \u00b5m, mean \u00b1 SD from 7 adjacent pairs of seam cell nuclei, again derived from the fitted data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These trends were not the results of artifacts in our fitting procedure, as they were evident also in the raw, averaged data (compare left and right graphs in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B-D</a>). The apparent differences in X- and Z- pre- and post-elongating seam cell nuclei positions that we observe are consistent with the asymmetric morphology of the pre-elongating embryo. Since the embryo starts out in a tadpole-like shape with the head larger than the tail, the seam cell nuclei in the head must move a greater distance than the nuclei in the tail to achieve a uniform diameter in the elongated embryo."

To our knowledge, current models of embryo elongation have not taken into account the differential elongation we observed across the worm body. We expect that incorporating additional data derived from cell positions and subcellular markers (especially cytoskeletal [<a href=\"#bib32\">Priess and Hirsh, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gally et al., 2009</a>]) in the embryo would help further refine existing models\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Ciarletta et al., 2009</a>) of embryo elongation."

Given our experience tracking seam cell nuclei, we next turned our attention to modeling the 4D motion of neurons and neurite outgrowth in the elongating worm embryo as a proof of concept for a neurodevelopmental atlas (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Videos 5</a>,<a href=\"#media6\">6</a>). Four of the five embryos used in constructing our seam cell model also had neuronal cell bodies marked with a <i>pceh-10::GFP</i> construct; neurons included AIYL/R, CANL/R, and ALA. We manually annotated the position of these neuronal cell bodies, then temporally aligned, averaged, and fitted the positions as we did the seam cell nuclei (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The axial motion of these neurons was qualitatively similar to the seam cell nuclei and could be well described by the three parameter logistic function. However, their XY motion appeared different than the seam cell nuclei. For example, the lateral motion of CANs could not be easily described by a simple function, so we used a 50 point smoothing of the averaged data as our 'fit'. The ALA X motion was better described by a 4<sup>th</sup> degree polynomial than a power law, so we used the former function to fit the data (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). As evident by their axial displacements, ALA and AIYL/R moved similarly to nearby seam cell nuclei (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In contrast, CANs moved faster than adjacent seam cell nuclei, suggesting a more 'active' mode of migration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Finally, the motion of ALA and CANs (especially CANL) were considerably more variable between datasets than the seam cell nuclei (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary files 2</a>,<a href=\"#SD3-data\">3</a>,<a href=\"#SD4-data\">4</a>). While it is currently unclear whether this variability is strain-dependent or reflects underlying biology, this observation underscores the need to study multiple embryos and assess the degree to which cellular motion is stereotyped in elongating embryos."

Our work suggests that this positional stereotypy extends to the cells in the late embryo as well. However, we also found that in the case of cells or structures which actively migrate, such as the CAN neurons and ALA neurites, there seems to be greater variability in terms of end position and growth rate. To some extent this is not surprising; as these cells and neurites move longer distances than most other cells, and depend on actively finding their way in a complex environment (as opposed to passive movement in response to elongation), there may be more room for variability in how they travel and reach their destinations."

Intrinsic developmental variability, caused by maternal effects or exposure to imaging could also have played a role in the slightly different patterns of development we observed across embryos."

Adding additional data to our 4D model is conceptually straightforward: strains with distinguishable neurons can be crossed into the untwisting background, untwisted, trajectories of cells and outgrowths fitted, and subsequently registered with previously derived data. 'Filling in' the positions of all neurons and outgrowths in the developing embryo would form the basis of the 4D atlas of neurodevelopment, and could be combined with functional activity mapping and gene expression data to provide a more comprehensive picture of animal development in late embryogenesis."

The core of the plugin relies on defining the sides of the worm embryo; although our work uses a specific set of markers, we note that any other markers which define the edges of the worm body should also work. The annotation capability is also flexible; as it is based on manual annotation, almost any distinct structure can be annotated. Finally, while the isotropic resolution of the diSPIM is very helpful in resolving fine embryonic detail (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), our untwisting algorithm is compatible with other high-resolution imaging methods. For example, we used a super-resolution two-photon instant structured illumination microscope (2P ISIM)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib42\">Winter, 2014</a>) to image and untwist a bent L2 larval worm, obtaining clear images of this relatively large specimen (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). Our plugin is designed specifically for untwisting nematode embryos, and as such is unlikely to be immediately applicable to other biological systems without substantial modification (we know of few non-nematode systems that have the same vermiform shape and degree of twisting and movement). However, some of the more general concepts we implement, such as the benefit of aligning and pooling information derived different datasets to generate an overall 4D view of development, are likely applicable to more systems than just the worm."

Automated lattice-building assumes the embryo has 20-22 seam cell nuclei on which the lattice is based; in early periods of elongation (especially the 1.5- to 2-fold transition) expression is absent in some seam cell nuclei, requiring manual lattice-building. In addition, time spent in editing automatic segmentation and lattice generation results in ~8 hr of manual work when untwisting an embryo spanning 100\u2013150 timepoints. Fully automated untwisting is not currently feasible, but the development of alternative markers may enable this goal. Second, although the positions of cells and neurites in the growing embryo can be determined with micron-scale precision, and placed in context with their neighbors, additional methods are needed to place the full morphological volume of a given cell within the untwisted embryo. While our data are of sufficient quality to segment such morphology in an untwisted animal (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>), the general question about how to combine morphological segmentations from distinct, untwisted embryos remains.

Most fluorescent strains label multiple neurons that are too close in space and time to be easily resolved \u2013 possible strategies to 'separate' these neurons might include 'Brainbow'\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Livet et al., 2007</a>) (spectral separation of densely labeled neurons) or heat-shock-based approaches\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Halfon et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bacaj and Shaham, 2007</a>) (temporal separation of densely labeled cells). Even if such strains are built, the identity of the resulting neurons will need to be verified. As lineaging\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Bao, 2006</a>) in <i>C. elegans</i> has been carried out to just before twitching begins\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Giurumescu et al., 2012</a>), in principle neurons can be identified by matching early expression to lineage data. If expression turns on after twitching, lineaging would also need to be extended into the post-twitching regime. Such 'deep lineaging', or tracking the coordinates of all nuclei through twitching would be a valuable and complementary effort to untwisting. Finally, we note that the expression pattern of fluorescent proteins within individual neurons could be further optimized. For almost all strains (except DCR4209 which contained membrane-targeted mCherry), fluorescent proteins were expressed cytoplasmically. An improved strategy would combine such cytoplasmic labeling with membrane targeting, better filling out very thin neuronal outgrowths that otherwise might be missed due to low expression; a similar strategy was adopted in super-resolution microscopy to trace thin neurites\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib25\">Lakadamyali et al., 2012</a>)."

Dual-color data were taken sequentially (first the 488-nm excitation for the GFP channel, and then 561-nm excitation for the mCherry channel) in a plane-by-plane (5 ms GFP collection, 5 ms mCherry collection per axial position in the embryo) fashion. Given 50 planes per view, and two perpendicular views, this resulted in an acquisition time of 1 s per 2-color diSPIM volume. For most datasets in this paper (embryos 2-8, as referred to elsewhere in the text), single-color volumes were acquired every 5 min, but for one datastet (embryo 1), single-color volumes were acquired every 2.5 min. Dual-color acquisitions were used to track ALA neurite outgrowth (embryos 7 and 8).

L2 larvae of strain SLS1 were immobilized with 50 mM levamisole (Sigma-Aldrich; St Louis, MO) and imaged on an agarose pad sandwiched between two #1.5 coverslips. Volumetric images of the entire specimen were acquired by manual XY translation of the stage between fields of view. Each raw frame was acquired in 200 ms; data used in this paper were derived by averaging six raw frames per axial position. Axial positions were spaced 0.333 \u03bcm apart. Individual 3D image stacks were stitched and overlaid to reconstruct the entire L2 stage worm using a custom plugin developed for MIPAV (available online at <a href=\"http://www.cit.nih.gov/mipav\">www.cit.nih.gov/mipav</a>). After stitching, the reconstructed L2 stage worm volume was further processed with 40 iterations of Richardson-Lucy deconvolution."

First, coordinate trajectories (X, Y, or Z positions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>) as a function of time) were 'cleaned' to remove obvious outliers, or to linearly interpolate gaps in the raw data (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Second, the axial (\u2018Z\u2019) coordinate of each cell was fitted to a three parameter logistic function (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) using Growth II (Pisces Conservation) or MATLAB (Mathworks) software, as this function provided a better fit than other three parameter growth curves, and did not require careful tuning of initial parameter values, as did the four parameter growth curves we tested (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Third, we aligned datasets from embryos 2-5 (volumes recorded every 5 min) to embryo 1 (volumes recorded every 2.5 min), by (i) determining the inflection time point (\u2018C\u2019 in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">2</a>) for each cell\u2019s fitted axial position and (ii) shifting the data an integral number of time points so that the inflection time points from embryos 2-5 agreed with the inflection point for embryo 1. For example, for the data shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for seam cell V3R nuclei, embryo 1 had inflection point 42.6, and embryo 4 had inflection point 37.7, so the V3R trajectory for embryo 4 was shifted 42.6-37.7 = 5 timepoints to the right, to match the trajectory for embryo 1. The same integer time point shift was then applied to the corresponding \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 coordinate trajectories for each cell. Fourth, after shifts were applied, coordinate trajectories were averaged. Finally, to generate noise-free trajectories, the average trajectories were fitted (functions chosen for the fits are shown in <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

However, two cell types, CAN and AIY, were not well described by any of the common fitting functions we surveyed (e.g. power, exponential, Gaussian, rational functions). For these cells, we instead used 50 point smoothing (for CAN X and Y coordinates) or a quartic polynomial function (for AIY X coordinates) to reduce noise in the shifted, averaged trajectories. To estimate how well the curve fitting described the averaged trajectories, we calculated the absolute differences between averaged and fitted coordinates at each time point, and then calculated the means and SD of these differences across time. These data are recorded in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a> as \u03bc <sub>avg-fit, time</sub> and \u03c3 <sub>avg-fit, time</sub>. We also computed the average over all seam cell nuclei of these average differences to generate &lt;\u03bc <sub>Xavg-Xfit, time</sub>&gt;<sub>seam cell</sub>; &lt;\u03bc <sub>Yavg-Yfit, time</sub>&gt;<sub>seam cell</sub>; and &lt;\u03bc <sub>Zavg-Zfit, time</sub>&gt;<sub>seam cell</sub> resulting in values of 0.5 \u00b5m, 0.6 \u00b5m, and 3.7 \u00b5m. In XY, similar average statistics were found for all cell types. In the Z coordinate, CANL stood out as more variable, as its \u03bc <sub>Zavg-Zfit, time</sub> was 10.2 \u00b5m (with a corresponding SD of 9.3 \u00b5m). We suspect the deviation between CANL data and fit arises more from the inherent variability with CAN cells (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>) than inherent problems with the fitting function choice."

The algorithm must segment nuclei with very different intensity threshold values, sizes and shapes. Not all seam cell nuclei are spherical due to motion blur. The algorithm must distinguish between seam cell nuclei and other features of the worm similar to the seam cell nuclei, for example the valves in the worm\u2019s digestive tract. Often the nose of the worm is labeled a seam cell nucleus while the 10<sup>th</sup> pair of seam cell nuclei, because they appear much fainter and are closer together than all other pairs, are combined into a single marker or simply not segmented at all. Accurate segmentation is complicated by division of the 8<sup>th</sup> pair of seam cell nuclei (QV5) at the later stages of the embryo\u2019s growth. During subdivision the QV5 pair is difficult to detect, and they may divide at different times, which causes the algorithm to detect 21 cells instead of 20 or 22\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig7\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 1</a>).

Because the volume appears mostly transparent except for the seam cell markers, the left-right markers are easy to select in 3D. The user can also interactively move points in the lattice after they are placed to better fit the data. Undo and redo features are also part of the lattice-building interface."

The first step in modeling the worm cross-section is to define an ellipse within each sample plane, centered in the plane. The long axis of the ellipse is parallel to the horizontal axis of the sample plane. The length is the distance between the left and right hand points. The ellipse short axis is in the direction of the plane vertical axis; the length is set to 1/2 the length of the ellipse long axis. This ellipse-based model approximates the overall shape of the worm, however it cannot model how the worm shape changes where sections of the worm press against each other. The next step of the algorithm attempts to solve this problem. (<a href=\"#fig18\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 12</a>)."

The centers of each ellipse are spaced one voxel apart along the center line curve of the worm, and each ellipse corresponds to a single output slice in the final straightened image. This step generates a model of the worm where each voxel that falls within one of the ellipses is labeled with the corresponding output slice value. Voxels where multiple ellipses intersect are labeled as conflict voxels. Once all ellipses have been evaluated, the conflict voxels are removed from the model."

For areas of the worm where it folds back on itself, this process results in a flattened cross-section where the folds press against each other, matching images observed in electron microscopy data (<a href=\"#fig24\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 18</a>).

Previous attempts to analyze these stages (in which many key processes of differentiation and circuit formation occur) have been obscured by factors such as muscle movements and the unpredictably folded conformation of the embryo as it elongates. Christensen et al. show that advances in imaging and image analysis can overcome these obstacles, allowing them to generate an 'untwisted' straightened view of the late embryo over time. Although this is laborious (15 h work per embryo) it is an important proof of principle and will open up this phase of development to analysis. The manuscript is thorough and well explained. This work will be of interest to the <i>C. elegans</i> and 'developmental imaging' communities."

The highest-quality lattices are generated when user builds a lattice that closely matches the morphology of the embryo, e.g. as quantified by the sides of the generated worm model having significant overlap with the actual sides of the embryo, the generated midline of the worm model following the actual midline of the embryo, etc. These requirements are best achieved by using as many lattice points as required to get a good match between the model and the actual data; depending on the degree of twisting/bending observed in a volume the number of required points needed to optimally capture the worm morphology may differ. In practice, lattices that match well with actual embryo morphology incorporate lattice points at each seam cell nucleus (for a total of 20-22 points), a pair of points at the nose (2 points), and as many points as required to capture bends occurring between seam cell nuclei (usually 2B, where B is the number of bends between nuclei in the volume). Hypodermal labeling past the tip of the tail is usually visible only in some volumes, but when observed, another pair of points is often placed at the tip of the tail (2 points). Thus, the minimum number of points required to generate a lattice (assuming 20 seam cell nuclei and no pair of tail points) is 22+2B. Using more points (more than 32) may provide better agreement between the generated model and the actual worm, but it usually leads only to minor changes in practice, and in our experience is not time-effective."

As described in the response to point 16, embryo development was not tracked from the two-cell stage, so it is likely that embryos were at slightly different ages at the onset of imaging. Temperature and other environmental conditions such as plate age were moderately controlled\u2014temperature may have fluctuated by 2-3 degrees C while keeping strains and during imaging\u2014and plates were used on consecutive days so plate ages may vary by up to a day. Finally, intrinsic variables like imaging conditions or health of the mother animal or embryo could have played a role in the variability we observed. We have described these issues in the second paragraph of the Discussion."
