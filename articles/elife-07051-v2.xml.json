The principal mechanism through which this is achieved in mammals is the respiratory chemoreflex whose circuitry is still elusive. A candidate element of this circuitry is the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a collection of neurons at the ventral medullary surface that are activated by increased CO<sub>2</sub> or low pH and project to the respiratory rhythm generator. Here, we use intersectional genetic strategies to lesion the RTN neurons defined by <i>Atoh1</i> and <i>Phox2b</i> expression and to block or activate their synaptic output. Photostimulation of these neurons entrains the respiratory rhythm. Conversely, abrogating expression of Atoh1 or Phox2b or glutamatergic transmission in these cells curtails the phrenic nerve response to low pH in embryonic preparations and abolishes the respiratory chemoreflex in behaving animals. Thus, the RTN neurons expressing <i>Atoh1</i> and <i>Phox2b</i> are a necessary component of the chemoreflex circuitry."

The principal mechanism through which this is achieved in mammals is the respiratory chemoreflex whose circuitry is still elusive. A candidate element of this circuitry is the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a collection of neurons at the ventral medullary surface that are activated by increased CO<sub>2</sub> or low pH and project to the respiratory rhythm generator. Here, we use intersectional genetic strategies to lesion the RTN neurons defined by <i>Atoh1</i> and <i>Phox2b</i> expression and to block or activate their synaptic output. Photostimulation of these neurons entrains the respiratory rhythm. Conversely, abrogating expression of Atoh1 or Phox2b or glutamatergic transmission in these cells curtails the phrenic nerve response to low pH in embryonic preparations and abolishes the respiratory chemoreflex in behaving animals. Thus, the RTN neurons expressing <i>Atoh1</i> and <i>Phox2b</i> are a necessary component of the chemoreflex circuitry."

The respiratory chemoreflex modulates ventilation in response to deviations in arterial or brain PCO<sub>2</sub>, mainly through the detection of changes in pH (<a href=\"#bib14\">Feldman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Guyenet et al., 2010</a>). These changes are sensed by central chemosensors located in the brainstem and by the carotid bodies in the periphery, but most of the CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensory drive to breathe is thought to arise centrally (<a href=\"#bib56\">Smith et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Duffin, 2010</a>). The nature of the central chemosensors and of the circuits that mediate the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> is still controversial (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guyenet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Huckstepp and Dale, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nattie, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Guyenet et al., 2013</a>). Two sites have been proposed to play a dominant role in the central CO<sub>2</sub> response: serotonergic neurons in the medulla (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ray et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Teran et al., 2014</a>) and the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a loose collection of neurons located ventral and immediately caudal to the facial nucleus (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goridis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Guyenet et al., 2013</a>). RTN neurons\u2014defined by their location, by the expression of Phox2b and of the vesicular glutamate transporter-2 Vglut2 (also known as Slc17a6) and by the absence of markers for the nearby motor and catecholaminergic neurons\u2014are vigorously activated by increases in CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mulkey et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Onimaru et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Neurons with the molecular characteristics of RTN neurons are already present ventral of the facial nucleus in the late embryo. The embryonic RTN neurons, previously termed embryonic parafacial cells, were found to have endogenous bursting properties and to couple with and increase the frequency of the respiratory rhythm generating (<a href=\"#bib14\">Feldman et al., 2013</a>) pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex (pre-B\u00f6tC) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dubreuil et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</a>)."

To target the Phox2b-expressing RTN neurons with utmost specificity, we exploited the fact that the majority of them belongs to the small set of neurons that co-express the Phox2b and Atoh1 transcription factors in the embryo (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dubreuil et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rose et al., 2009b</a>). We found that invalidation of <i>Atoh1</i> in <i>Phox2b</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cells, of <i>Phox2b</i> in <i>Atoh1</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cells or of glutamatergic transmission in <i>Phox2b</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>/<i>Atoh1</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cells curtailed the response to acidification in embryonic brainstem preparations and eliminated the CO<sub>2</sub> response in newborn pups. Optogenetic activation of these cells entrained ongoing respiratory rhythm. Together our findings imply that the RTN neurons that express or have expressed <i>Phox2b</i> and <i>Atoh1</i> are essential for the activation of breathing by increased CO<sub>2</sub> or low pH, and that other contributors to the chemoreflex must act via the RTN or in partnership with it."

The Phox2b<sup>+</sup> RTN neurons are glutamatergic (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bochorishvili et al., 2012</a>) and express the glutamate transporter <i>Vglut2</i> already at embryonic stages (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dubreuil et al., 2009</a>). We could thus use expression of the channelrhodopsin-2-YFP (ChR2-YFP) fusion protein driven by the <i>Vglut2</i> promoter in <i>Vglut2::ChR2-YFP</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib23\">H\u00e4gglund et al., 2010</a>) to stimulate embryonic RTN neurons by light. In the transgenic embryos, cells co-expressing ChR2-YFP and Phox2b were concentrated at the medullary surface ventral to the ChR2-YFP-negative facial neurons, thus well accessible to light delivered from the ventral surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). At embryonic-day 14.5 (E14.5), single light pulses (473 nm, 70 ms, 1\u20135 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) applied to the RTN region in brainstem preparations systematically evoked a burst of action potentials in ChR2-YFP expressing cells (n = 5) that resembled the spontaneous rhythmic bursts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). A latency of 192 \u00b1 12 ms (n = 51 stimulations in three cells) was measured from the time of onset of the light stimulus to that of the first action potential of the burst response suggesting the requirement of a still unknown, slow obligatory process for burst initiation in the RTN. 1 day later, when the preB\u00f6tC is coupled to the RTN oscillator and drives a respiratory-like motor outflow (<a href=\"#bib64\">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</a>), single light pulses (473 nm, 150 ms, 1\u20135 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) delivered to the medullary surface triggered motor bursts in the C4 phrenic nerve roots (hereafter C4). When the light pulses were set to activate the RTN in a rhythmic manner at about twice the frequency of the ongoing endogenous rhythm, the C4 motor bursts could be entrained to the stimuli and followed the light-imposed rhythm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). C4 motor bursts could not be evoked when the preB\u00f6tC excitability was depressed by the \u03bc-opiate agonist D-Ala<sup>2</sup>-<i>N</i>-Me-Phe<sup>4</sup>-Glycol<sup>5</sup>-enkephalin (DAMGO, 0.3 \u03bcM, n = 4 preparations) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mellen et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) or its development impaired genetically in <i>Dbx1</i> null mutants (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouvier et al., 2010</a>) (n = 5 preparations) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) indicating that the motor outputs require an intact preB\u00f6tC. These data suggest that malfunction of the RTN will result in lack of entrainment of the preB\u00f6tC and thus of the motor output and in a slowed-down C4 activity."

A second, independent site of <i>Atoh1</i> expression is post-mitotic, in cells that co-express the Phox2b transcription factor and surround the trigeminal motor nucleus (hereafter periV neurons) and the facial nucleus (hereafter periVII neurons, which include a majority of the RTN neurons) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dubreuil et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rose et al., 2009b</a>). The lack of CO<sub>2</sub> responsiveness of <i>Atoh1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos could thus be caused by malfunction of the RTN or some other <i>Atoh1</i>-dependent structure. Similarly, the <i>Phox2b</i> mutant backgrounds analyzed so far, in which the RTN was deleted and CO<sub>2</sub>/pH chemosensitivity abrogated, suffered to various extents from a lack of specificity. In these mutants, potentially all Phox2b-expressing cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dubreuil et al., 2008</a>) or all those derived from dB2 progenitors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dubreuil et al., 2009</a>) or from rhombomeres 3 and 5 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</a>) could have caused the respiratory defect. Others have used local viral injection in combination with a general <i>Phox2b</i> promoter to activate or silence the RTN (<a href=\"#bib37\">Marina et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Basting et al., 2015</a>). However, one drawback of this approach is that the nearby Phox2b<sup>+</sup> catecholaminergic neurons, which also control breathing but whose connectivity and functions differ from that of the RTN, are transduced as well. We therefore sought to design genetic strategies to make the <i>Atoh1</i> or <i>Phox2b</i> mutations more selective."

To monitor these cells specifically, we constructed the <i>Atoh1</i><sup><i>FRTCre</i></sup> line (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), which expresses Cre recombinase from the <i>Atoh1</i> locus conditionally to the action of FLP recombinase, and partnered it with the <i>P2b::FLPo</i> allele that expresses <i>FLP</i> from the <i>Phox2b</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hirsch et al., 2013</a>).

The latency of the C4 response and its variability (666 \u00b1 20 ms for 123 photostimulations), which cannot be easily explained by the time required for polysynaptic propagation of activity, probably reflect the delays caused by processes necessary for burst intitiation in the RTN (192 \u00b1 12 ms, see above) and in the preB\u00f6tC (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kam et al., 2013</a>)."

In the latter experiments, activation of breathing could not be unambiguously traced back to RTN neurons classically defined as non-catecholaminergic and non-cholinergic, since as many nearby catecholaminergic as non-catecholaminergic and some cholinergic neurons also expressed ChR2 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott et al., 2011</a>). These results are consistent with our data obtained in reduced preparations. Together, they show that the RTN regulates inspiration, not only expiration as postulated by others (<a href=\"#bib32\">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</a>). In fact, opinions vary regarding the role of Phox2b-expressing RTN neurons in active expiration. <a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott et al.

At E16.5, in baseline conditions, sectioning accelerated C4 discharges by suppressing the inhibitory influence on the respiratory rhythm generator (RRG) exerted by pontine neurons (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ito et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hilaire et al., 2004</a>). However, the response to a pH challenge was fully preserved (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>) (p = 0.1, n = 34).

A comparison of spontaneous and evoked motor burst parameters, measured on 150 spontaneous and 147 evoked C4 bursts, showed that the amplitudes and kinetics of spontaneous and evoked motor bursts were not significantly different (spontaneous vs evoked amplitude: 310 \u00b1 11 a.u. vs 317 \u00b1 13 a.u., p = 0.33; time to peak: 194 \u00b1 9 ms vs 202 \u00b1 12 ms, p = 0.61; half-width: 446 \u00b1 15 ms vs 454 \u00b1 17 ms, p = 0.73; decay time: 487 \u00b1 16 ms vs 509 \u00b1 20 ms, p = 0.40). In the <i>P2b::CreBAC1;Atoh1</i><sup><i>lox/lox</i></sup> background, the same light stimulus resulted in the activation of only a few RTN neurons and completely failed to trigger bursts in C4 and the facial nucleus (n = 317 photostimulations in 6 preparations) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Therefore, the residual Phox2b and Lbx1 co-expressing RTN precursors that reach the medullary surface (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>) are unable to mount a motor response."

It has, however, proved difficult to pinpoint the contribution of individual classes of neurons to defined behaviors. One example is the RTN. The RTN neurons have been implicated in breathing regulation by CO<sub>2</sub>, but their importance for the respiratory chemoreflex in the intact brain remains controversial (<a href=\"#bib30\">Huckstepp and Dale, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nattie, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Guyenet et al., 2013</a>). Here we reexamined this issue using novel genetic backgrounds inspired by prior evidence that RTN neurons express and require the Phox2b and Atoh1 transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dubreuil et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rose et al., 2009b</a>). We first established that the <i>Phox2b</i><sup><b><i>on</i></b></sup><i>/Atoh1</i><sup><b><i>on</i></b></sup> subset of RTN neurons are (i) rhythmically active, (ii) are activated by low pH, and (iii) both necessary and sufficient for optogenetic entrainment of the phrenic nerve. These neurons thus have the functional signatures of RTN neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abbott et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</a>). We then show that an <i>Atoh1</i> constitutive null mutation and three conditional mutations specifically targeting <i>Phox2b</i><sup><b><i>on</i></b></sup><i>/Atoh1</i><sup><b><i>on</i></b></sup> neurons and disrupting RTN formation or function abolish the CO<sub>2</sub>-evoked ventilatory response in neonates. Finally, we provide evidence that periV neurons, the only other group of neurons targeted by the conditional mutations, are not involved in the chemoreflex. We conclude that the neurons in the RTN region that have a history of both <i>Phox2b</i> and <i>Atoh1</i> expression are obligatory elements of the circuitry for breathing regulation by CO<sub>2</sub> in neonates."

Using a distinct Phox2b::Cre line to delete Atoh1 in Phox2b lineage cells, Huang et al. reported a slowed down basal respiratory rhythm, a hallmark of RTN impairment (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dubreuil et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</a>), but a fully preserved response to acidification in brainstem-spinal cord preparations at late gestation. They did not test the chemoreflex in behaving pups, but it is only in the latter that we find a complete abrogation of the reflex. A possible explanation is that in vitro the RTN precursors misrouted to the dorsal site of the facial nucleus in the conditional <i>Atoh1</i> mutants are able to mount a motor response to bath acidification whose magnitude may depend on the precise experimental conditions. In support of this, we found that the ectopic dorsal cells in the mutants respond to low pH by accelerating their firing rate."

The partial recovery of the CO<sub>2</sub> response in adults could be due to late compensation by residual RTN neurons, to a strengthening of peripheral chemoreceptor input that bypasses the RTN (<a href=\"#bib3\">Basting et al., 2015</a>) or to some of the multiple sites proposed to function as CO<sub>2</sub> sensors in the brain which would now also bypass the RTN (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nattie and Li, 2009</a>). The lack of the chemoreflex in many human CCHS patients (<a href=\"#bib59\">Straus et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Weese-Mayer et al., 2010</a>) suggests that these putative compensatory sites also have a history of <i>Phox2b</i> expression."

On the one hand, RTN neurons are exquisitely sensitive to small changes in CO<sub>2</sub>/pH (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mulkey et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Onimaru et al., 2008</a>), also when synaptically isolated (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2013</a>) and, in close apposition to numerous capillaries (<a href=\"#bib44\">Onimaru et al., 2012a</a>), well positioned to sense PCO<sub>2</sub> in the blood. On the other, they receive afferences from many brainstem sites that contain putative chemosensors (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rosin et al., 2006</a>) and respond with depolarization to activation of nearby acid-sensitive astrocytes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gourine et al., 2010</a>). In addition, RTN neurons receive excitatory connections from the carotid bodies via the nucleus of the solitary tract and increase their firing rates in response to carotid body stimulation by hypoxia (<a href=\"#bib61\">Takakura et al., 2006</a>). The carotid bodies are not only the main PO<sub>2</sub> sensors, but provide also a substantial fraction of the overall CO<sub>2</sub> response (<a href=\"#bib15\">Forster et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Smith et al., 2006</a>). Still, we observed a complete loss of the chemoreflex in neonates with impaired RTN function.

However, the results of previous loss-of-function experiments to assess the part played by RTN neurons in the chemoreflex circuitry are not entirely conclusive. In previous work, we have monitored the chemoreflex in mice in which subsets of <i>Phox2b</i> expressing neurons including the RTN were genetically lesioned. In these genetic backgrounds, RTN neurons were deleted and the chemoreflex lost, but the effect could not be unambiguously attributed to the RTN (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dubreuil et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</a>). Others have impaired RTN function in behaving adult rats using pharmacological or pharmacogenetic approaches, but similar data are not available for the newborn period. Bilateral lesions of the neurokinin1 receptor-expressing neurons in the RTN region by injection of saporin conjugated to a substance P analogue have produced variable results, ranging from a modest attenuation of the chemoreflex in an earlier study (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nattie and Li, 2002</a>) to a substantial decrease in recent work (<a href=\"#bib60\">Takakura et al., 2014</a>). Silencing the neurons in the RTN region by the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist muscimol also yielded a large reduction of the hypercapnic response (<a href=\"#bib62\">Takakura et al., 2013</a>). These experiments, however, lack specificity and the extent of the lesion or inhibition is difficult to control. <a href=\"#bib37\">Marina et al. (2010)</a> used a pharmacogenetic approach to silence RTN neurons. Administration of allatostatin to rats which had received local injections of a lentivirus vector expressing the allatostatin receptor from an artificial <i>Phox2b</i> promoter reduced the hypercapnic response by an average of 60%. However, the approach used by Marina et al. targets the neurons in the rostral ventro-lateral medulla defined by Phox2b expression alone. They include C1 adrenergic and A5 noradrenergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib58\">Stornetta et al., 2006</a>), whose contribution to the observed effect was not assessed."

Removal of <i>Vglut2</i> and thus glutamatergic synaptic transmission selectively from <i>Phox2b</i><sup><i>on</i></sup>/<i>Atoh1</i><sup><i>on</i></sup> neurons affected baseline ventilation only very slightly but eliminated the chemoreflex at birth.

Irregular or instable respiration at birth is characteristic for preterm infants and not uncommon in babies that are born at term (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gaultier and Gallego, 2005</a>). The key role of the RTN for breathing regulation at birth that we show here suggests that defective development or immaturity of the human equivalent, apart from causing CCHS (<a href=\"#bib70\">Amiel et al., 2003</a>), could also underlie more common respiratory problems in the newborn period."

E18.5 pups delivered by Caesarean sections or P0 pups were placed under a heating lamp and were gently touched for 10 min until their breathing had stabilized. After a 7 min familiarization period in the plethysmograph chambers, breathing parameters (breath duration [T<sub>TOT</sub>], tidal volume [V<sub>T</sub>], and ventilation [V<sub>E</sub>] calculated as V<sub>T</sub>/T<sub>TOT</sub>) were continuously monitored in apnea-free periods. E18.5 to P2.5 animals were placed in a 30 ml chamber and their ventilation was recorded continuously for a period of 800 s composed sequentially of a 200 s exposure to normal air followed by a 200 s exposure to hypercapnic air (8%CO<sub>2</sub>/21%O<sub>2</sub>/71%N<sub>2</sub>) before normal air was resumed for the remaining 400 s. Adult animals were recorded in a larger chamber, first for 100 s in normal air, then the animals were exposed to the hypercapnic mix for 3 min before initiation of a 100 s period of recording prior to returning to normal air breathing. Calibrations were performed at the end of each recording session by injecting 2.5\u20135 \u03bcl of air in the chamber with a Hamilton syringe. In plots showing the continuous evolution of respiratory parameters before, during and after the hypercapnic challenge, each circle represents the mean, across all animals of a given genotype, of the parameter values binned in 20 s intervals. To quantify breathing parameter changes induced by hypercapnia, we first calculated for each animal the ratio of the mean parameter value during the last 100 s of the hypercapnic period over that during the last 100 s of the preceding normocapnic period, and then calculated the mean of these ratios in the population of control and mutant animals and expressed them as percentage (\u0394V<sub>E</sub> graphs and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

To determine the changes in calcium activity we first calculated a \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> time-series using a plugin of PhysImage that implements a running moving average for baseline subtraction. This tool calculates F<sub>0</sub> by taking the fluorescence image (F) at each time-step (t) as follows: \u0394F(t)/F<sub>0</sub> = (F(t) \u2212 F<sub>0</sub>(t))/F<sub>0</sub>(t), where <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><msub><mtext>F</mtext><mtext>0</mtext></msub><mrow><mo>(</mo><mtext>t</mtext><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munderover><mo>\u2211</mo><mrow><mtext>i</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>t</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>i</mtext><mo>+</mo><mtext>w</mtext></mrow></munderover><mrow><mtext>F</mtext><mrow><mo>(</mo><mtext>i</mtext><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mtext>w</mtext></mfrac></mrow></math> and w = 100 and the last w frames of the time-series are dropped. To identify rhythmic RTN cells and establish RTN maps of activity we performed cycle-triggered averages (CTAs) using the anatomical location of the RTN to define the region of interest (ROI) that represents broad RTN activity. Using the built-in ImageJ Z-project function, we calculated the image representing the standard deviation (SD) of the CTA and used an iterative thresholding algorithm to identify potential ROIs representing cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hayes et al., 2012</a>). A trace representing each ROI's activity was extracted and then the ROIs were validated by calculating the power spectral density of these traces. If the peak power of each trace was not in the range 0.1\u20130.4 Hz, the corresponding ROI was discarded. For mutant backgrounds with no discernable RTN activity, the same strategy of detection was used except that the SD image of the full \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> time-series was taken into account rather than SD of the image after CTA."

By using intersectional genetic strategies and imaging of population activity in the RTN, the authors find that invalidation of <i>Atoh1</i> in <i>Phox2b</i><sup>+</sup> cells, or <i>Phox2b</i> in <i>Atoh1</i><sup>+</sup> cells or invalidation of glutamatergic transmission in <i>Phox2b</i><sup>+</sup>/<i>Atoh1</i><sup>+</sup> cells changes the response of the cells to acidification in slices of the brainstem and abolishes responses to CO<sub>2</sub> in newborn mice. Optogenetic activation of the cells restored and entrained respiratory rhythms indicating that <i>Atoh1</i> and <i>Phox2b</i> are required for the activation of breathing by increased CO<sub>2</sub> or low pH. In summary, I do like the study. It combines genetic and imaging techniques to examine the role of RTN cells in respiration and brings in new information on the role of a subset of RTN cells in respiration.

In the postnatal period, some chemoreflex/CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity is recovering in the absence of the RTN. Thus, in the mature animal additional centers participate chemoreflex/CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity, although the importance of these might be overestimated due to compensatory responses/mechanisms. A further finding is the identification of <i>Atoh1</i><sup>+</sup>/<i>Phox2b</i><sup>+</sup> periV cells, and the elimination of these as candidates in the chemoreflex circuitry. The findings are of relevance for human pathology, i.e. congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, and has an impact on the understanding of more general respiratory problems in newborns."

The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is no exception but what makes this topic of particular interest is the mounting evidence that this nucleus might be the nodal point for the homeostatic regulation of arterial PCO<sub>2</sub> through breathing and that its abnormal development underpins CCHS (congenital central hypoventilating syndrome). Originally, RTN was rather vaguely identified as a collection of neurons located at the ventral surface of the brainstem. At present we know that the critical pH-activated neurons express various transcription factors such as <i>Atoh1</i>, <i>Egr2</i>, <i>Phox2b</i> etc. during development and we suspect that these neurons are glutamatergic. However, a definitive identification of the neurons responsible for the regulation of breathing by CO<sub>2</sub> is still lacking and the study of these neurons is hampered by the impossibility to transduce them selectively with contemporary excitatory or inhibitory actuators (<i>ChR2</i>, etc)."

Using an elegant combination of intersectional genetics and integrative neurobiology (calcium imaging, whole cell recording, histology), the authors demonstrate that the critical neurons require both <i>Atoh1</i> and <i>Phox2b</i> for their correct development by describing the adverse consequences of knocking out Atoh1 or conditionally knocking out <i>Phox2b</i> in <i>Atoh1</i> expressing neurons on these neurons and the breathing response of the mice to CO<sub>2</sub>. The intersectional genetic strategy provides a mouse line in which the <i>Cre</i> recombinase is expressed almost exclusively by the RTN chemoreceptors. These mice will undoubtedly become the gold standard for future studies of these neurons. Using these mice, the authors show for the first time that the <i>Phox2bon/Atoh1on</i> RTN neurons use glutamate as transmitter and that these neurons and the embryonic parafacial oscillator are one and he same. The latter observation provides definitive evidence that the RTN chemoreceptors exhibit group pacemaker properties during the late developmental stages and function as an oscillator that is coupled to the preBotzinger complex."

The differences that the authors discuss are probably caused by the fact that the connections between RTN and the rest of the RPG are very complex in fully developed rodents and the effects produced by RTN activation depend on which part of the whole network is functional. For example, the effect of RTN activation on inspiration (frequency and amplitude) is very strong in conscious rats (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott et al. 2011</a>), mediocre in arterially perfused preparations (<a href=\"#bib37\">Marina et al, 2010</a>) and essentially absent in some anesthetized preparations (Huckstepp et al., J of N 2015)."

For example, further evidence is needed to show that indeed <i>Atoh1</i> and <i>Pho2b</i> neurons are intrinsically rhythmically active and chemosensitive because this could mean that cells sensitive to acidification could also be involved in rhythm generation. Moreover, that the response of the cells to acidification is intrinsic needs further experimental proof. Finally, it should be clarified what precisely ontogenetic activation does to <i>Atoh1</i>/<i>Phox2b</i> cells. If they are as shown in the paper to generate C4 motor responses, this would mean that they are active during inspiration.

The <i>Phox2b</i><sup>+</sup> RTN neurons are glutamatergic (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bochorishvili et al., 2012</a>) and express the glutamate transporter <i>Vglut2</i> already at embryonic stages (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dubreuil et al., 2009</a>). We could thus use expression of the channelrhodopsin-2-YFP (ChR2-YFP) fusion protein driven by the <i>Vglut2</i> promoter in <i>Vglut2::ChR2-YFP</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib23\">H\u00e4gglund et al., 2010</a>) to stimulate embryonic RTN neurons by light. [\u2026]When the light pulses were set to activate the RTN in a rhythmic manner at about twice the frequency of the ongoing endogenous rhythm, the C4 motor bursts could be entrained to the stimuli and followed the light-imposed rhythm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). C4 motor bursts could not be evoked when the preB\u00f6tC excitability was depressed by the \u00b5 -opiate agonist D-Ala <sup>2</sup> - <i>N</i>-Me- Phe<sup>4</sup>- Glycol <sup>5</sup>-enkephalin (DAMGO, 0.3\u00b5M, n=4 preparations) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mellen et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) or its development impaired genetically in <i>Dbx1</i> null mutants (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouvier et al., 2010</a>) (n=5 preparations) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) indicating that the motor outputs require an intact preB\u00f6tC. These data suggest that malfunction of the RTN will result in lack of entrainment of the preB\u00f6tC and thus of the motor output and in a slowed-down C4 activity.\u201d"
