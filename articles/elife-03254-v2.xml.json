Although active centromeric transcription has been documented for over a decade, the role of centromeric transcription or transcripts has been elusive. Here, we report that centromeric \u03b1-satellite transcription is dependent on RNA Polymerase II and occurs at late mitosis into early G1, concurrent with the timing of new CENP-A assembly. Inhibition of RNA Polymerase II-dependent transcription abrogates the recruitment of CENP-A and its chaperone HJURP to native human centromeres. Biochemical characterization of CENP-A associated RNAs reveals a 1.3 kb molecule that originates from centromeres, which physically interacts with the soluble pre-assembly HJURP/CENP-A complex in vivo, and whose down-regulation leads to the loss of CENP-A and HJURP at centromeres. This study describes a novel function for human centromeric long non-coding RNAs in the recruitment of HJURP and CENP-A, implicating RNA-based chaperone targeting in histone variant assembly."

Reducing the levels of this RNA within the cells made them unable to separate their chromosomes correctly during cell divisions.

Although centromeric DNA sequence is not uniform across species, centromere function is conserved (<a href=\"#bib26\">Sullivan, 2009</a>). In humans, AT-rich 171 bp \u03b1-satellite repeats lacking any known genes are the primary DNA component of the centromere (<a href=\"#bib33\">Waye and Willard, 1987</a>). Centromeres are characterized by the presence of the centromeric histone H3 variant (CENH3/CENP-A in human). Centromeric chromatin has long been considered heterochromatic, despite exhibiting a bivalent organization with heterochromatin-like post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as H3 and H4 hypo-acetylation, and transcription-coupled PTMs, including dimethylation on H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Sullivan and Karpen, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Heintzman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>). The function of such bivalent modifications has remained mysterious. Indeed, despite the common assumption that centromeres are largely dormant, a number of recent studies have pointed to the importance of transcription at centromeres in multiple organisms, which appears to be essential for the maintenance of centromere integrity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hall et al., 2012</a>). Chemical inhibition of either RNA Polymerase I (RNAPI), or RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), results in loss of the inner kinetochore protein CENP-C, and in chromosome mis-segregation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chan et al., 2012</a>). Centromeric RNA components also seem to contribute to the structural integrity of the mitotic centromere (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wong et al., 2007</a>). However, the exact timing of centromeric transcription, the polymerase involved, the identity of centromeric RNAs and their precise role in maintaining native centromere integrity in human cells has been elusive."

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP), and immunofluorescence (IF) on chromatin fibers, we find that RNAPII, in conjunction with TATA-box binding protein (TBP) localizes to, and actively transcribes native human centromeres from late mitosis to early G1 (eG1). Biochemical purification and sequencing of the RNA associated with human centromeric chromatin at eG1 reveals a 1.3 kb long transcript. This RNA physically interacts with CENP-A and its chaperone HJURP (Holliday junction recognition protein) in the pre-assembly soluble state in vivo. Targeted sequence-specific knockdown of the transcript results in the formation of multipolar spindles and lagging chromosomes in subsequent mitoses, leading to chromosome instability. IF analysis of centromeric chromatin fibers demonstrates that these cellular and nuclear phenotypes arise specifically from the abrogation of CENP-A and HJURP localization to the centromere. Together, our data describe a direct physical role for a centromeric long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in HJURP targeting, subsequent CENP-A loading, and the maintenance of centromere integrity. Our study supports the possibility that an lncRNA-based mechanism is involved in targeting CENP-A and its chaperone HJURP to the centromere."

In order to achieve this, we extracted chromatin from non-synchronized cells after a short MNase digestion, to obtain long chromatin arrays that are rich in tri-, tetra-, and penta-nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). From this input chromatin, centromeric chromatin was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against either CENP-A, or the inner kinetochore protein CENP-C or no antibody (mock IP). The mock IP control shows no enrichment of any of the centromeric proteins tested (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). As expected, Western blots revealed reciprocal co-purification of CENP-A and CENP-C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, left and middle panels). RNAPII and its partner TBP also co-purified with CENP-A and CENP-C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, left and middle panels). To further establish an interaction between RNAPII and centromeric proteins, we performed the reciprocal experiment, precipitating RNAPII<sup>S2P</sup> from solubilized chromatin, and testing for centromeric partners. While Western blots revealed little or no interaction of RNAPII with CENP-C, a robust and reproducible binding of RNAPII to TBP and CENP-A was observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, right panel). Thus, active RNAPII machinery is physically associated with CENP-A chromatin at eG1."

A logical prediction arising from these data is that centromeric transcripts might physically associate with the soluble pre-assembly HJURP/CENP-A complex in vivo. Indeed, computational RNA-binding prediction algorithms revealed potential RNA binding residues in both HJURP and CENP-A (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Wang et al., 2010</a>).

CENP-A and HJURP complexes were immunoprecipitated from SF and CF. Mock IPs pulled down neither CENP-A nor HJURP (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>).

This sequencing approach was moderately successful, yielding one sequence of \u223c665 nucleotides (cenRNA#1, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This RNA sequence is unique and contains four semi-regularly spaced 28-bp repeats with a weak homology to the canonical CENP-B box (data not shown), but does not map to the currently annotated human genome sequence, to any other organisms, or to plasmids. Since most human centromeres remain intractable to complete sequencing (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lander et al., 2001</a>), this outcome is not entirely surprising. We were unable to detect cenRNA#1 directly on Northern blots, presumably due to its low abundance or due to its instability. Therefore, to directly reveal the genomic origin of the sequenced RNA, we converted it to a DNA FISH probe (cenRNA#1<sup>DNA</sup>). We next either performed control IF/FISH using the Xist locus (Xist<sup>DNA</sup>, on the q-arm of the X-chromosome) and CENP-A, IF/FISH with cenRNA#1<sup>DNA</sup> and CENP-A, or IF/double-FISH with CENP-A, cenRNA#1<sup>DNA</sup> and centromeric \u03b1-satellite probes, on chromatin fibers. As expected, control IF/FISH between Xist<sup>DNA</sup> and CENP-A yielded no appreciable signal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In contrast, about half the CENP-A, or centromeric \u03b1-satellite stained fibers, contain the cenRNA#1<sup>DNA</sup> signal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, left vs right, quantification below panel). This result is consistent with the fact that centromeric \u03b1-satellite DNA sequences are not strictly conserved across all human centromeres (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lander et al., 2001</a>). Significantly, 100% of the cenRNA#1<sup>DNA</sup> was found associated with CENP-A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, top right panel), and with centromeric \u03b1-satellite DNA probe (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, lower right panel), demonstrating robust association on centromeric chromatin fibers. Thus, these data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) indicate that the sequenced lncRNA (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which is associated with CENP-A at eG1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indeed has a centromeric origin."

We were curious whether the loss of centromeric transcripts directly abrogated CENP-A and HJURP localization at centromere. Because the loss of centromeric transcripts resulted in reduced cell density and mitotic defects (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), there were insufficient cells for biochemical experiments. Thus, we turned to chromatin fibers to investigate this issue. After synchronization at eG1, chromatin fibers were isolated from shRNA<sup>scram</sup> cells, or the few remaining of shRNA<sup>sat</sup>-transfected cells, and stained for RNAPII and centromeric proteins. In both, shRNA<sup>scram</sup>- or shRNA<sup>sat</sup>-transfected cells, RNAPII<sup>S2P</sup> remains associated with centromeric chromatin fibers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, first top panel), confirming that RNAPII localization and transcription of centromeres are independent of centromeric transcripts. Additionally, CENP-B and CENP-C localization was also unaffected at centromeres (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, second and third panels). In contrast, on centromeric fibers from shRNA<sup>sat</sup>-transfected cells, CENP-A and HJURP were barely detectable (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, fourth and fifth panels). These data suggest that at eG1, CENP-A targeting through its chaperone HJURP is dependent not just on active transcription itself, nor on processes that facilitate centromeric transcription (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barnhart et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), but specifically requires the presence of centromeric transcripts. The long-term loss of these centromeric transcripts leads to mitotic defects (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), which are physically underpinned by the loss of HJURP recruitment and CENP-A loading (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) to native centromeres."

In this study, we investigated the mechanistic contribution of transcription, and centromeric transcripts, to centromeric integrity. We show that RNAPII and TBP are loaded onto and transcribe human centromeric chromatin at eG1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This cell cycle regulated centromeric transcription is required for the synthesis of centromeric RNAs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Biochemical purification and analysis reveal a 1.3 kb transcript which is physically associated with CENP-A and HJURP in the soluble pre-assembly state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Targeted destruction of this centromeric RNA leads to the loss of centromere integrity and subsequent mitotic and cellular defects (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), which are mechanistically underpinned by the loss of HJURP and CENP-A recruitment to centromeres at eG1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Altogether, these data reveal a hitherto unsuspected function for lncRNAs in RNA-dependent chaperone targeting to centromeres in human cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Because the repetitive nature of centromeric \u03b1-satellite DNA has thus far disallowed complete sequencing, successful annotation of transcriptional motifs that may exist in human centromeres remains to be accomplished. Our data show that centromeric transcription is an event integral to the epigenetic maintenance of centromere integrity, and discovering precisely where such motifs lie within active centromeres is an exciting avenue of research."

Specific depletion of centromeric \u03b1-satellite transcripts affects the recruitment of both CENP-A and HJURP proteins, directly implicating centromeric RNA in CENP-A and HJURP targeting onto centromeres at eG1. We note that previous data have shown that HJURP loading is also dependent on its interaction with the Mis18 complex, in a CDK1-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barnhart et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Moree et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Muller et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). However, mutations of CDK1-phosphorylated sites in HJURP only partially abrogate its recruitment in vivo, highlighting the existence of other hitherto unknown CENP-A loading factors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). We speculate centromeric lncRNAs are, in fact, the missing factor. Thus, of immediate interest is the elucidation of the structure of the 1.3 kb centromeric RNA with its cognate binding domains in CENP-A and HJURP."

For example, whereas it is well known that Xist RNA binds its cognate DNA locus only in <i>cis</i> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Plath et al., 2002</a>), it is unknown if centromeric transcripts can bind in <i>cis</i> solely to the centromere of origin, or in <i>trans,</i> across all centromeres. An attractive possibility is centromeric RNAs originate from multiple centromeres and serve a redundant function to ensure accurate targeting of CENP-A/HJURP to homologous centromeres."

Prior studies have described RNA originating from centromeres in multiple species (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bouzinba-Segard et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Carone et al., 2009</a>). In mouse cells, a 120 nucleotide minor satellite RNA is associated with centromeres (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bouzinba-Segard et al., 2006</a>), and in tammar wallaby, centromeric transcription results in the production of \u223c40 nucleotides crasiRNAs (centromere repeats-associated short interacting RNAs) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carone et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lindsay et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carone et al., 2013</a>). A logical explanation for the difference in size of ncRNAs generated in different organisms may be the divergent nature of the centromeric DNA sequences across species, which in turn may lead to divergence in the type of centromeric RNAs produced. However, despite this difference, over-expression or down-regulation of mouse minor satellite RNA, or crasiRNAs in tammar wallaby, or the 1.3 kb centromeric human RNA identified in our study, leads to similar cellular and mitotic defects. Our data reveal that such RNAs generated from human centromeric transcription bind HJURP and CENP-A in the soluble form and that mitotic loss seen in cells depleted of these lncRNAs is specifically linked to abrogation of HJURP-mediated targeting of CENP-A. Thus, our data suggest an evolutionarily conserved basis for the phenomena of centromeric transcription seen in other organisms. We speculate that accurate CENP-A targeting onto active centromeres probably requires a \u2018dual-lock\u2019 system, coupling chromatin-bound centromeric factors (such as Mis18), which facilitate cell-cycle regulated centromeric transcription, which in turn results in the production of a lncRNA/CENP-A/chaperone complex that can effectively target CENP-A back to pre-existing active centromeric sites (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Whereas it might be assumed that alpha satellite is necessary and sufficient, because all human centromeres are embedded in alpha satellite, the occurrence of neocentromeres implies that alpha satellite is not sufficient for localization of the centromere foundation protein, the histone H3 variant CENP-A. A chaperone protein, HJURP, has been identified as being a requirement, and it is known that at least some alpha satellite sequences are transcribed, but these finding do not provide a clue as to how centromeres are maintained throughout the cell cycle. Now the authors show that transcription during early G1 is necessary for correct localization of CENP-A and describe an RNA sequence component of the CENP-A assembly complex that is required for normal centromere function. The data supporting these major novel points are convincing, making this study an exciting advance in understanding how centromeres are maintained."

Oddly, this portion lacks alpha satellite, even though it was picked up on a Northern blot using alpha satellite as probe. Some details are needed concerning exactly what the probe was. It would seem surprising if the 665-bp sequence is also absent from human short-read archives, as there is no reason to expect there to be a bias against a centromere-linked sequence in unassembled short reads produced from whole genomic DNA. If the sequence is not also found there, then some rational explanation for the phantom nature of this sequence would be welcome. For example, perhaps it derives from an as-yet unidentified endogenous RNA virus particle. In any case, the Northern should be reprobed with this 665-bp sequence to determine whether the sequence identified is actually present in the RNA."

Using immuno-precipitation and chromatin fibers imaging, they were able to identify a single 1.3 kb centromeric RNA that is claimed to play a critical role in CENP-A targeting and deposition at centromeres. The identified RNA molecule interacts with the soluble pre-assembly HJURP and CENP-A complexes in vivo. Its down-regulation is suggested to result in the loss of CENP-A and HJURP from centromeres and to subsequent chromosome instability. The 1.3 kb molecule is transcribed by RNA Polymerase II from centromeric DNA. Accordingly, inhibition of RNA Polymerase II transcription abrogates the recruitment of both CENP-A and its chaperone HJURP to centromeres."

For instance, Bouzinba-Segard et al. (PNAS, 2006) showed the forced accumulation of the mouse centromeric repeat transcripts (120 nucleotide long) leads to chromosome missegregation. In addition, it has been shown using human artificial chromosome, the alteration of the post-translational modifications associated with centromeres, may increase or decrease the level of transcription at this chromatin domain. In both situations, the structure and function of centromere are affected (<i>e.g.</i>, chromosome missegregation, loss of centromeric proteins) (Bergmann et al., EMBO J. 2011, Bergmann et al., Chromosome Research 2012). However, the over-expression of centromeric RNAs observed after stress suggests this alteration may also be a response to environmental conditions (Jolly et al., JCB 2004, Bouzinba-Segard et al., PNAS, 2006). Indeed, the over-expression of cenRNAs is currently being analyzed in the lab, but is outside the scope of this manuscript."
