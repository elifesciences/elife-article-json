In this study, we show that MHC-II expression on lymph node stromal cells is additionally required for homeostatic maintenance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and maintenance of immune quiescence. In the absence of MHC-II expression in lymph node transplants, i.e. on lymph node stromal cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells became activated, ultimately resulting in transplant rejection. MHC-II self-antigen presentation by lymph node stromal cells allowed the non-proliferative maintenance of antigen-specific Tregs and constrained antigen-specific immunity. Altogether, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which lymph node stromal cells regulate peripheral immunity."

In this study, we show that MHC-II expression on lymph node stromal cells is additionally required for homeostatic maintenance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and maintenance of immune quiescence. In the absence of MHC-II expression in lymph node transplants, i.e. on lymph node stromal cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells became activated, ultimately resulting in transplant rejection. MHC-II self-antigen presentation by lymph node stromal cells allowed the non-proliferative maintenance of antigen-specific Tregs and constrained antigen-specific immunity. Altogether, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which lymph node stromal cells regulate peripheral immunity."

The interaction between these components within the lymph node parenchyma is fostered by its highly structured architecture, which is dictated by resident non-hematopoietic stromal cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Katakai et al., 2004</a>). Despite their low frequency among total lymph node cells, lymph node stromal cells have gathered considerable attention recently, as they were found to have important immunoregulatory functions. Indeed, in addition to promoting the communication between dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocytes by providing anchorage for DCs and guiding T cells via the production of chemokines (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sixt et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bajenoff et al., 2006</a>), lymph node stromal cells were shown to regulate the size of the lymphocyte pool by providing essential survival factors (<a href=\"#bib25\">Link et al., 2007</a>) and to limit T cell activation/proliferation by producing nitric oxide (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lukacs-Kornek et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Siegert et al., 2011</a>)."

In this study, we have investigated, for the first time, the function of endogenous MHC-II molecules on lymph node stromal cells.

Within 4 weeks, these transplants reconnect to the lymphatic and blood vasculature. While the stromal cell compartment within the transplant remains of donor origin, virtually all immune cells of the donor animal will be replaced by host-derived cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wolvers et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hammerschmidt et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Molenaar et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, transplantation of MHC-II KO lymph nodes into wild-type recipients resulted in selective absence of stromal cell endogenously expressed MHC-II molecules, whereas MHC-II was normally expressed on the recipient-derived hematopoietic cells that had migrated into the transplanted lymph node (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure. 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Residual MHC-II expression on stromal cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure. 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was likely due to the acquisition of dendritic cell-derived peptide\u2013MHC-II complexes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dubrot et al., 2014</a>). Of note, extra-thymic AIRE-expressing cells (ETACs), which were initially characterized as a stromal cell subset (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gardner et al., 2008</a>) but later determined to be hematopoietic-derived (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gardner et al., 2013</a>), expressed CD45, CD11c, EpCAM, as well as MHC-II (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) within MHC-II KO lymph node transplants (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1,2</a>). Therefore, ETACs are likely not involved in the phenotypes described below. Ablation of MHC-II on lymph node stromal cells resulted in increased frequencies of CD62L<sup>\u2212</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells within the transplanted lymph nodes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). T cell activation was restricted to MHC-II KO transplants, as the endogenous lymph nodes of MHC KO lymph node transplant recipients showed similar frequencies of na\u00efve and activated T cells as compared to the endogenous lymph nodes of wild-type transplant recipients (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Likely as a consequence of local activation, MHC-II KO transplants ended up being rejected, since by week 8 post-transplantation, they could not be recovered. Compared to wild-type transplants, 4 weeks after transplantation, MHC-II KO lymph node transplants showed significant rigidity and tissue damage and the unusual presence of large clusters of CSFR1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>Moma2<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>MHC-II<sup>+</sup> macrophages (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Furthermore, they showed increased expression of several gene transcripts recently associated with a \u2018universal\u2019 rejection module (<a href=\"#bib20\">Khatri et al., 2013</a>) and an overall increased common rejection module (CRM) score (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Altogether, our results suggest that MHC-II expression on lymph node stromal cells regulates T cell activation, exerting a local dampening effect on both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells."

These results therefore suggested that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation in the absence of MHC-II expressing lymph node stromal cells was not a direct consequence of deregulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, but rather appeared to be constrained by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Further supporting this notion, also within the endogenous lymph nodes of CD4-depleted mice receiving MHC-II KO lymph node transplants, a significant increase of CD62L<sup>\u2212</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was observed when compared to wild-type lymph node transplant recipients (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Thus, it appears that in contrast to our initial hypothesis, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells not only restrain local CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation in transplanted lymph nodes in a manner that is dependent on lymph node stromal cell endogenous MHC-II expression but are also required to prevent its systemic spreading."

Since Treg frequency was reduced in MHC-II KO lymph node transplants (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) and Treg development and maintenance involves agonistic selection on MHC-II presented peptides (<a href=\"#bib17\">Josefowicz et al., 2012</a>), we decided to assess directly whether lymph node stromal cell endogenous MHC-II deficiency would affect Tregs. By transferring CFSE-labeled T cells into <i>Rag2</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice transplanted with either MHC-II KO or wild-type lymph nodes, we found the homeostatic proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> cells to critically depend on stromal cell endogenous MHC-II expression. As compared to wild-type transplants, CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> cells proliferated roughly 3 times less efficiently in MHC-II KO lymph node transplants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), resulting in a threefold reduction in Treg frequency (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). A reduction in the proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>\u2212</sup> cells was also observed in MHC-II KO lymph node transplants, although this did not reach statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Overall, these results revealed a pivotal role for lymph node stromal cell MHC-II expression on the homeostatic proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which seemed particularly relevant for the homeostatic maintenance of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs."

                                "text": "The observation that MHC-II expression on lymph node stromal cells impacted on the peripheral maintenance of Tregs implied that cognate ligands for the T cell receptor (TCR) of Tregs are expressed and presented by the lymph node stromal cell compartment. In support of such hypothesis, previous research has reported expression of several peripheral tissue-restricted antigens (PTAs) in lymph node stromal cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nichols et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cohen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fletcher et al., 2010</a>). To assess whether lymph node stromal cells were able to present endogenous antigens in the context of MHC-II molecules, we used K14-mOVA transgenic mice, in which ovalbumin (OVA) expression is driven by the human keratin 14 promoter (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bianchi et al., 2009</a>). In these mice, OVA is expressed in the skin and thymus (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bianchi et al., 2009</a>) as well as in the 3 major lymph node stromal cell subsets (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). As all primary lymph node stromal cell cultures established contained large amounts of contaminating hematopoietic cells (data not shown), which precluded our in vitro antigen presentation assays, we generated distinct lymph node stromal cell lines by long-term in vitro culture of lymph node single cell suspensions of K14-mOVA mice on collagen matrixes. Using this approach, we generated one cell line (K14-mOVAneg), resembling FRCs, which did not express detectable OVA mRNA transcripts and was thus used as a control cell line, and another cell line (K14-mOVApos), resembling LECs, which expressed OVA transcripts abundantly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Co-culture of these cell lines with OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> OT-I and CD4<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cells revealed that OVA-derived peptides could be presented by lymph node stromal cells in MHC-I as well as MHC-II molecules, as both OT-I and OT-II T cells showed increased CD25 expression when cultured with K14-mOVApos but not with K14-mOVAneg cells (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Neither lymph node stromal cell line induced OT-I or OT-II T cell proliferation, however (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To directly address whether self-antigen presentation by lymph node stromal cells in the context of MHC-II molecules influenced Tregs, we repeated our co-culture experiments and stained CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for Foxp3 and Helios. As compared to culture in medium alone, co-culture of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with either cell line increased the survival of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells irrespective of their TCR specificity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), which is suggestive of the production of T cell survival factors by both cell lines (<a href=\"#bib25\">Link et al., 2007</a>). More importantly, K14-mOVApos cells significantly increased the recovery of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cells as compared to the K14-mOVAneg cell line (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This effect was not apparent in co-cultures with wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and could be blocked by the addition of the MHC-II blocking antibody M5/114 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), indicating that the presentation of OVA-derived peptides in the context of MHC-II molecules by the K14-mOVApos cell line was the driver of increased Foxp3<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cell survival in our assays. Of significance, CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>\u2212</sup> conventional OT-II T cells, in the exact same conditions, did not show similar behavior (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Overall, our data suggest that MHC-II-mediated self-antigen presentation by lymph node stromal cells drives CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg maintenance."

In this transplantation setting, OVA expression became confined to the transplanted lymph node stromal cells. Transplantation of K14-mOVA lymph nodes did not affect the endogenous pools of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, or CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, as in the transplants as well as in the endogenous lymph nodes of the different \u2018chimeric\u2019 mice, the frequencies of the various T cell subsets were comparable (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly, transferred OT-II T cells showed a comparable distribution of na\u00efve CD62L<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>\u2212</sup> and activated CD62L<sup>\u2212</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> phenotypes in wild-type and K14-mOVA lymph node transplants as well as in wild-type endogenous lymph nodes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Confirming our in vitro data, OT-II T cells did not proliferate (data not shown). Presentation of OVA by the lymph node stroma, however, led to a significant increase in the number of CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cells, particularly of the na\u00efve-like CD62L<sup>+</sup> subtype, within K14-mOVA transplants as compared to wild-type lymph node transplants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Higher frequencies of total and CD62L<sup>+</sup> na\u00efve-like CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> OT-II Tregs were also evident in the endogenous lymph nodes of recipients of K14-mOVA lymph node transplants as compared to wild-type lymph node transplant recipient mice, although this did not translate in increased cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In conclusion, our data suggest that the presentation of endogenous antigens by the lymph node stroma contributes to the selective maintenance of antigen-specific Tregs."

Remarkably, in contrast to K14-mOVA skin transplants, K14-mOVA lymph node transplants showed unaltered CRM scores when compared to wild-type transplants or to endogenous non-transplanted wild-type lymph nodes (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), which suggest that lymph node stromal cells are specifically endowed with regulatory potential. As assessed by the CRM, this capacity seemed to be, at least partially, dependent on MHC-II expression (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Taken together, our data suggest that antigen-presenting lymph node stromal cells constrain immune responses in vivo independently of antigen-specific T cell deletion."

Lymph node stromal cells have been shown to regulate the proliferation of activated T cells by inhibiting T cell homotypic interactions and restraining entry into cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lukacs-Kornek et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Siegert et al., 2011</a>). In addition, they were shown to induce the deletion of auto-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells via their capacity to produce, process, and present PTAs on MHC-I molecules (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nichols et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Magnusson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cohen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fletcher et al., 2010</a>) and to induce CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell dysfunction via acquired peptide\u2013MHC-II complexes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dubrot et al., 2014</a>). In the present study, we have investigated the role of these cells as antigen-presenting cells via endogenous, non-acquired MHC-II. We have shown that MHC-II-mediated antigen presentation by lymph node stromal cells promotes the maintenance of Tregs contributing to the preservation of immune quiescence."

As evidenced by transplantation of MHC-II KO lymph nodes, which resulted in selective MHC-II deficiency on the transplanted lymph node stromal cell compartment, MHC-II expression on lymph node stromal cells controlled the activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Both T cell subsets showed an increased frequency of CD62L<sup>\u2212</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> activated cells in MHC-II KO lymph node transplants as compared to wild-type lymph node transplants. These results are particularly relevant, as in the context of the ability of lymph node stromal cells to capture dendritic cell-derived peptide\u2013MHC-II complexes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dubrot et al., 2014</a>), they reveal a critical role for lymph node stromal cell endogenously expressed MHC-II in immune regulation. The effect of stromal cell MHC-II deficiency on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation was rather unexpected as MHC-II molecules are not thought to mediate cellular interactions with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Additional experiments, however, showed that this effect resulted from the lack of regulation by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In line with this, we found that in the absence of endogenous MHC-II expression on lymph node stromal cells, the maintenance as well as the proliferation of Tregs was impaired. Together, these data showed that for the homeostatic regulation of Tregs, similar as for other lymphocyte populations (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cyster et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dummer et al., 2001</a>), access to the lymph node parenchyma is required. Importantly, our data also suggest that the maintenance of Tregs and their control of T cell activation are spatially linked and must occur within the same location. In fact, even though Treg numbers were adequately maintained in secondary lymphoid organs other than the transplant, the inability to maintain them within MHC-II KO lymph node transplants resulted in the local activation of T cells, which in the long-term resulted in the rejection of the MHC-II KO transplants. This is significant as it suggests that, in order to minimize host vs graft disease in transplanted individuals, local maintenance of Tregs should be enforced."

In our experiments, we used MHC-II KO animals that were established by the insertion of a hygromycin-resistance cassette at the deletion site, spanning from the second exon of H2-Ab1 to the third exon of the H2-Ea gene, into 129S2/SvPas-derived H1 embryonic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Madsen et al., 1999</a>). As the H2 locus of C56BL/6J and 129Sv strains is identical (<i>b</i> haplotype) and our MHC-II KO animals show normal MHC-I expression (<a href=\"#bib27\">Madsen et al., 1999</a>), rejection of MHC-II KO lymph nodes could not have been caused by impaired recognition of MHC-I molecules. Indeed, if faulty recognition of MHC-I molecules would be responsible for MHC-II KO transplant rejection, one would not expect CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation to be present and augmented by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell deletion. Unappreciated antigens derived from the hygromycin-resistance cassette could play a role in MHC-II KO lymph node rejection, as recipient mice had never been exposed to such antigens. However, previous experience with lymph nodes harboring GFP constructs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Molenaar et al., 2009</a>) and presently also with the K14-mOVA transgene suggest that possibility to be remote. Taken these considerations as a whole, our data strongly support the notion that endogenous MHC-II expression on lymph node stromal cells is critical for maintaining low CRM scores and thus safeguarding tolerance."

Similarly, our data with the K14-mOVA transgenic lymph node transplantation and OT-II T cell transfer system confirmed that the peripheral maintenance of the Treg pool required MHC-II-mediated presentation of endogenous antigens as well. Presentation of OVA-derived peptides by the transplanted lymph node stromal cell compartment led to enhanced numbers of OT-II Tregs within the lymph node transplant, which was particularly evident for CD62L-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs. Determination of the origin of the expanded cells warrants further research. Given that a large fraction of the expanded Treg population expressed Helios (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), a transcription factor originally associated with Treg development in the thymus (<a href=\"#bib39\">Thornton et al., 2010</a>), it may seem that transferred thymus-derived OT-II Tregs were specifically maintained via cognate interactions with the K14-mOVA lymph node stroma. Alternatively, as Helios expression was more recently shown to be induced upon T cell activation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akimova et al., 2011</a>) preceding Foxp3 induction on peripherally induced Tregs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gottschalk et al., 2012</a>), it may be that our expanded Treg population reflects peripheral differentiation of na\u00efve OT-II T cells into OT-II Tregs. In either case, the increase in OT-II Tregs did not involve cellular proliferation. This contrasts with the effect of self-antigen recognition in peripheral tissues, such as the skin, which induces vigorous Treg proliferation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rosenblum et al., 2011</a>). Overall, our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that the antigen-mediated interaction between lymph node stromal cells and Tregs provides specific survival signals to the latter cells that may allow antigen-stimulated Tregs to outcompete Tregs that have not seen their cognate antigen. If present, such a mechanism would most likely select the Treg repertoire to match the peripheral need for immune regulation. Supporting this hypothesis, it was previously shown that the peripheral Treg repertoire differs significantly between different anatomical locations (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lathrop et al., 2008</a>), a situation that may reflect differences in regional lymph nodes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wolvers et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hammerschmidt et al., 2008</a>)."

We observed comparable frequencies of OVA-specific IFN\u03b3-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells between mice transplanted with K14-mOVA transgenic lymph nodes and mice transplanted with wild-type lymph nodes. Unresponsiveness did not seem to arise from the deletion of OVA-specific IFN\u03b3-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells either. This is in agreement with the recent observation by Magnusson et al., showing that self-antigen presentation by lymph node stromal cells does not promote the deletion of self-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Magnusson et al., 2008</a>). This is however, in contrast with the findings that LECs induce antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dubrot et al., 2014</a>). The reasons for such disparate results are currently unknown, but may relate to the use of different experimental systems and/or to putative differences in self-antigen processing by lymph node stromal cells and dendritic cells. Regardless of the origin of such discrepancies, together these results highlight the existence of multiple regulatory mechanisms that in concert safeguard the homeostasis of the immune system."

This may be particularly relevant in the context of immune responses as presentation of exogenous antigen by lymph node stromal cells may contribute to reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell deletion, to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell dysfunction, and/or to Treg expansion and therefore prevent excessive inflammation or contribute to the contraction of the immune response. Alternatively, as lymph node stromal cells express toll-like receptors (TLRs) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fletcher et al., 2010</a>), it may be that during immune responses antigen processing gets redirected (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blander and Medzhitov, 2006</a>) and that lymph node stromal cells, like dendritic cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Reis e Sousa, 2006</a>), mature from a tolerogenic phenotype towards an immunogenic one."

However, no analysis of Tregs is provided in this part of the study. The data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5 and 6</a> suggest that some form of immunoregulation is conferred by OVA expression in the transplanted lymph node however both donor and host tissues express MHC class II in these experiments. OVA expressed in the donor lymph node could have been presented by either donor lymph node cells (stroma), through the direct antigen presentation pathway, or by host antigen presenting cells that enter the graft (dendritic cells, monocytes) and present via an indirect pathway (endocytosis or phagocytosis of OVA expressing cells or via membrane transfer). Ideally, these transplant experiments would have been done in hosts with MHC class II deficiency in bone marrow derived antigen presenting cells such that the only MHC class II expressing cells would come from the donor tissue. The requirement for MHC class II in CD4 T cell and Treg development however makes it impossible for the authors to do these experiments using the MHC class II global knockout mice at hand. However, a definitive analysis of the cells presenting MHC class II-OVA peptides and Treg maintenance in their experimental system would be necessary to substantiate the authors' claims and conclusions. Putting these issues aside, the critical comparison in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a> shows an interesting trend in the CRM score when transferred lymph node contains cells expressing OVA but importantly this difference does not reach statistical significance and therefore does not support the claims made by the authors."

However, no analysis of Tregs is provided in this part of the study. The data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5 and 6</a> suggest that some form of immunoregulation is conferred by OVA expression in the transplanted lymph node however both donor and host tissues express MHC class II in these experiments. OVA expressed in the donor lymph node could have been presented by either donor lymph node cells (stroma), through the direct antigen presentation pathway, or by host antigen presenting cells that enter the graft (dendritic cells, monocytes) and present via an indirect pathway (endocytosis or phagocytosis of OVA expressing cells or via membrane transfer). Ideally, these transplant experiments would have been done in hosts with MHC class II deficiency in bone marrow derived antigen presenting cells such that the only MHC class II expressing cells would come from the donor tissue. The requirement for MHC class II in CD4 T cell and Treg development however makes it impossible for the authors to do these experiments using the MHC class II global knockout mice at hand. However, a definitive analysis of the cells presenting MHC class II-OVA peptides and Treg maintenance in their experimental system would be necessary to substantiate the authors' claims and conclusions. Putting these issues aside, the critical comparison in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a> shows an interesting trend in the CRM score when transferred lymph node contains cells expressing OVA but importantly this difference does not reach statistical significance and therefore does not support the claims made by the authors."

However, together with the data presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, in which we show that antigen presentation by lymph node stromal cells in vitro leads to the selective survival of antigen-specific CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells in a MHC-II-dependent manner, we have established that lymph node stromal cells can directly present antigens to T cells. We fully realize that the transfer of MHC-II-antigen peptide complexes from dendritic cells to lymph node stromal cells, as published by Dubrot et al (JEM, 2014) is a mechanism by which lymph node stromal cells can also regulate their antigen presenting function. This mechanism would however not play a significant role in these settings, as dendritic cells are circulating and host-derived cells (as also shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a> and further explained under point 1) and thus are not expressing the K14-OVA transgene. Reversely, the possibility that MHCII-peptide complexes are transferred from donor-derived stromal cells to circulating dendritic cells is indeed a possibility, and may occur in addition to the direct presentation of antigen by stromal cells, as we have shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>."

Subsequently, applying one-way Anova on the transformed data revealed that the differences between the animals transplanted with wild-type lymph nodes and K14mOVA skin and animals transplanted with K14mOVA lymph nodes and skin reached a p-value of 0.036, and thus statistically significantly different from each other. Moreover, an even less stringent correction is allowed according to the statistician, approaching the data in a one-tailed manner, resulting in p-value of 0.018 between these two groups.

We have not compared Treg persistence upon co-culture with stromal cells to co-culture with dendritic cells pulsed with OVA peptide.

Indeed, even if OVA peptides were to be exogenously added to stromal cells and DCs, DCs would most likely outperform stromal cells, again given their higher MHC-II expression. Similar results are to be expected if full length OVA was to be added and antigen presentation would rely on antigen acquisition and processing, given the role of DCs as professional antigen-presenting cells."

We attribute these discrepancies to the selective retention of OT-II T cells in K14mOVA transplants (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a> below \u2013 left panel). Antigen recognition in K14mOVA transplants possibly induces TCR-mediated stop signals (TCR-mediated CD69 upregulation would drive intracellular retention of the egress receptor S1P1 and thus trap OT-II T cells in the transplant (Shiow et al, Nature 2006)). Such an event induces a generalized increased in OT-II T cell numbers in K14mOVA transplants, including Foxp3<sup>+</sup> OT-II Tregs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>), without necessarily changing the balance between Foxp3- and Foxp3+ OT-II T cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). In K14mOVA transplants, Foxp3+ OT-II T cells will receive enhanced survival factors, which will enhance their overall maintenance. As in the context of antigen-driven activation, CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs downregulate S1P1 at a slower pace as compared to conventional CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T cells (Liu et al, NatImmunol 2009), they will egress from the K14mOVA transplants faster than their conventional counterparts and thus better populate distal lymph nodes. This leads to an increase in the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cells in the endogenous lymph nodes of K14mOVA lymph node recipients.

The range of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> Tregs frequencies in wild-type transplants and K14mOVA transplants is 1.17-3.74% and 1.70-7.31%, respectively. To more faithfully represent our data, in the revised Figure, we have replaced those plots by plots showing percentages of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> Tregs closer to the averages observed."
