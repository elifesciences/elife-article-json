In mice, the heart starts to pump blood shortly after embryonic day 8 (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib1\">Chen and Wang, 2012</a>), and this primitive circulatory system is vital for ensuring the proper development of the embryo. Many different cell types coexist within the heart, such as muscle cells, vascular cells and pacemaker cells (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib2\">Chien et al., 2008</a>). These different types of cell arise from a common pool of progenitor cells, but the details of this process and how these cells are maintained within the mature heart have puzzled cardiovascular scientists. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Kathryn Ivey, Deepak Srivastava and co-workers at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease\u2014including Amy Heidersbach as first author\u2014have offered some important clues about the underlying mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib2a\">Heidersbach et al., 2013</a>)."

These molecules, which are evolutionarily conserved, regulate gene expression by binding to specific sequences within the messenger RNAs and reducing their stability or preventing them from being translated into proteins. Precise miR activity is required for the heart to develop normally, and for it to be able to respond to challenges such as insufficient blood supply, and pressure overload (the increased stress that develops in the left ventricular wall when the heart pumps blood)<b>.</b> Currently known cardiac enriched miRs include miR-1, 133, 206, 208 and 499 (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib1\">Chen and Wang, 2012</a>), with miR-1 being the most abundant in the adult mouse heart."

Srivastava and co-workers have previously investigated the role of miR-1-2 during the development and maintenance of the heart (<a href=\"#bib5\">Zhao et al., 2007</a>). In the current study, they have also involved its close relative, miR-1-1, in order to investigate the consequences of complete loss of miR-1 in the mammalian heart, and to identify any functions of miR-1 that are dependent on the amount of miR present."

Accordingly, targeted deletion of miR-1-1 results in a phenotype similar to that described for miR-1-2-null mice. However, the genetic background of the knock-out mice seems to affect the phenotype, as indicated by results from Heidersbach et al. and also those of another group who observed no phenotypic changes in miR-1-133 knock-out mice (<a href=\"#bib4\">Wystub et al., 2013</a>). Nevertheless, both groups show that mice lacking all miR-1 copies (miR-1 null) die before weaning due to developmental defects. Heidersbach et al. observed abnormalities in mitochondria (the cell\u2019s energy-producing organelles) as well as dysfunctional sarcomeres\u2014the basic functional units of muscle fibres, which consist of thick filaments formed from the protein myosin and thin filaments made up of the protein actin."

The <i>mlck</i> gene encodes an enzyme that adds phosphate groups to myosin molecules, and levels of this enzyme were increased in miR-1 null mice. However, this increased level of <i>mlck</i> was accompanied by a reduction, rather than an increase, in the phosphorylation of its substrate, the myosin light chain. This apparent contradiction was resolved by the discovery that miR-1 deletion leads to increased expression of an alternative form of MLCK, known as telokin, which lacks catalytic activity. Telokin is normally found only in smooth muscle\u2014the type of weakly contractile muscle that lines the gut and the blood vessels\u2014and its increased expression prevented MLCK kinase from phosphorylating myosin."

Likewise, the dramatic increase in <i>mlck</i> expression (roughly fourfold) also suggests involvement of a more complex regulatory mechanism, since miRs generally change the expression level of their target messenger RNA by only 20\u201350% (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib3\">van Rooij and Olson, 2012</a>)."

This protein, known as \u2018smooth muscle version of Myocardin\u2019, interacts with a transcription factor called SRF, which regulates the expression of genes that determine the characteristics of cardiac and smooth muscle. It turns out that smMYOCD is a direct target of miR-1. Moreover, the smMYOCD-SRF complex is more effective at promoting transcription of <i>telokin</i> than the cardiac version of Myocardin is. This completes a negative feedback loop that ensures that heart cells have a cardiac rather than smooth muscle phenotype: miR-1 suppresses smMYOCD, promoting the expression of the cardiac enzyme <i>mlck</i>, rather than smooth muscle genes such as <i>telokin</i>, resulting in phosphorylation of myosin and the formation of sarcomeres (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

In addition to directly inhibiting the expression of <i>telokin</i> (left), miR-1 also inhibits the expression of <i>telokin</i> indirectly by reducing the expression of a protein called smMYOCD that, working with a transcription factor called SRF, activates the transcription of <i>telokin</i> (right). This combination of two different regulatory mechanisms guarantees that <i>telokin</i> will be inhibited in heart cells, ensuring the formation of highly contractile cardiac muscle."

Theoretically, miRs can target hundreds of genes across the genome due to the short target sequences (6\u20138 nucleotides) they recognize. The working model built by Heidersbach et al. illustrates how networks of genes regulated by miRs can indirectly control the expression of a critical gene in any tissue (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Direct miR-mediated repression of a transcriptional activator for a target gene amplifies the influence of that miR on its target. In the example described by Heidersbach et al., the feedback loop comprised of miR-1, SRF and smMYOCD guarantees the sensitive and powerful regulation of <i>telokin</i> in response to environmental and pathological stimuli, and probably makes the heart more robust."
