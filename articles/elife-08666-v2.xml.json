In third instar larvae (L3), cells constituting the second tracheal metamere (Tr2) reenter the cell cycle. Clonal analysis of L3 Tr2 revealed that dividing cells in the dorsal trunk, dorsal branch and transverse connective branches respect lineage restriction boundaries near branch junctions. These boundaries corresponded to domains of gene expression, for example where cells expressing Spalt, Delta and Serrate in the dorsal trunk meet <i>vein</i>\u2013expressing cells in the dorsal branch or transverse connective.

In contrast, the roles and contributions of determined cell lineages are not as clear and may not be generally shared. In Drosophila, there are tissues that are dependent on cell lineages - examples include neurons in the developing brain (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib57\">Spindler and Hartenstein, 2010</a>) and the developmental compartments that produce the adult cuticle (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib11\">Crick and Lawrence, 1975</a>). However, there are also organs such as the salivary gland, gut and tracheal system of the Drosophila embryo that form from groups of non-mitotic cells (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib30\">Kerman et al., 2006</a>). The cells of these organs are assigned to their roles after they have exited the cell cycle, and the programs of tubulogenesis and branching that generate them proceed without further cell divisions. Even the complex network of tracheal branches in the embryo forms in this way, and without an apparent role for defined lineages (<a href=\"#bib54\">Samakovlis et al., 1996</a>)."

Although analysis of random clones revealed no consistent relationships between position and kinship that would suggest a role for cell lineage in assigning cells to a particular tracheal branch (<a href=\"#bib54\">Samakovlis et al., 1996</a>), there is evidence for region-specific and stage-specific gene expression, and mutant phenotypes suggest that these genes have essential roles in the morphogenetic processes that generate the branches. For example, <i>trachealess (trh</i>) is expressed by pit cells and in all tracheal progenitors, and in <i>trh</i> mutants, pits do not form and there is no apparent tracheal development (<a href=\"#bib29\">Isaac and Andrew, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wilk et al., 1996</a>). <i>Spalt (sal</i>) is expressed in the dorsal part of the tracheal primordium that will form the dorsal branch (DB) and dorsal trunk (DT), and in <i>sal</i> mutants, the dorsal primordium expresses genes such as <i>unplugged,</i> which is normally only expressed ventrally, and its cells do not migrate normally (<a href=\"#bib17\">Franch-Marro and Casanova, 2002</a>). These and other findings have been interpreted as dorsal to ventral transformations and as evidence that <i>sal</i> has a role in fate specification for particular branches (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kuhnlein and Schuh, 1996</a>). Mutants defective for <i>knirps (kni)</i> and for\u00a0Notch signaling have major branching abnormalities suggestive of general and persistent requirements that begin at the earliest primary branching stages (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ghabrial and Krasnow, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ikeya and Hayashi, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Llimargas, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Steneberg et al., 1999</a>). Although these studies support the idea that specialization and branch formation are dependent on region-specific expression of several fate-determining genes, the expression patterns of these genes have not been precisely correlated (at cellular resolution) with branching morphologies. There is evidence supporting the presence of a <i>kni</i>-dependent border between DT and DB cells in the embryo (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 1998</a>), but it is not known whether the different branches, either alone or in combination, exist as distinct regions that develop with unique genetic addresses."

At 0\u20132 hr after the L2-3 molt, 22/24 marked cells appeared to be isolated singles without marked neighbors, as would be expected prior to onset of proliferation and for the observed frequency of recombination (11%). At 16\u201318\u00a0hr , 80% were still singles, but at 18\u201320 hr, 69% were clones of two adjacent cells. This suggests that re-entry into the cell cycle was synchronous and that most DT cells divide according to a similar schedule. The clones formed contiguous patches (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), indicating that the DT cells do not tend to migrate or intermix with their neighbors; there was no apparent bias to their distribution within the DT. Divisions continued with approximate synchrony and with cycle time (at 23\u00b0C) of 10\u201312 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The time interval during L3 that follows the onset of mitotic cycling can therefore accommodate five divisions, and if all of the starting population contributes to growth, the five divisions are sufficient to produce all the cells in the DT of the wandering L3. The maximum clone size is predicted to be 32, suggesting that larger patches we identified represent &gt;1 independent clone whose descendants grew together."

Cells on the trunk side of this border expressed Ser and Delta; cells on the other side expressed Cut and Vein. This border is more complex than the DT/DB border in several respects. First, the border extends a significant distance into the area of the DT and does not align with the DT/TC junction. Cells in this area of the DT are members of the TC lineage domain. Second, cells located in this part of the TC domain varied in number and size, and in contrast to the other Tr2 branches, there were large cells in this region in most wandering stage L3s. The number of large cells varied between 0\u20133. This may be a consequence of delayed entry into mitotic cycling by these cells and the possibility that some of the wandering L3s that we analyzed had not yet reached the stage when these cells start to divide; but we have not established the reason for the variability. Third, whereas all cells in the DT lineage domain expressed Sal and Ser at high levels and no cells in the TC lineage domain expressed either gene at high levels, in some samples, low level expression of Sal was detected in 1\u20132 TC domain cells that were adjacent to the DT domain on the \u201clower layer\u201d next to the wing disc (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,H\u2019,H\u201d</a>). All cells in the region of the TC domain in the DT expressed Cut and Vein. We note that there are also small regions of gene expression or lineage ambiguities at the anterior/posterior (A/P) compartment borders of the wing and eye-antennal imaginal discs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Blair, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Morata and Lawrence, 1979</a>), and suggest that the TC is also a lineage domain despite the apparent ambiguity for Sal at the DT/TC boundary. The TC lineage domain is defined by expression of Cut and Vein and by lack of expression of Ser and Delta, and it includes a portion that is physically within the DT. Based on this model, we suggest that Tr2 has distinct domains of gene expression that correlate with the DB, DT and TC. No distinct domains of gene expression that delimited the ASP from the TC were observed. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a> depicts these DT, DB and TC domains."

In the L3 Tr2, NRE-<i>lacZ</i> expression was also detected in the DT/DB and DT/TC junctions, as well as in the ASP, in the TC adjacent to the spiracular (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C, D</a>) and in 1\u20132 cells of the visceral branch proximal to the TC (not shown). Notch signaling in the ASP is activated by Delta that is expressed in ASP-associated myoblasts (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huang and Kornberg, 2015</a>); we did not investigate the function of Delta or Serrate expression by ASP cells or the source of the activating ligand for Notch activation in the TC or visceral branch."

All of the NRE-lacZ expressing dorsal branch cells expressed Kni; all of the NRE-<i>lacZ</i> expressing TC cells expressed Cut. These results show that boundaries that define the DB, DT and TC gene expression domains are sites of Notch signaling. In the DB, expression of NRE-<i>lacZ</i> was highest in the cells that abut the Ser/Delta/Spalt expressing DT cells, and it decreased with increasing distance from the boundary. Similarly, expression of NRE-<i>lacZ</i> in the \u201cTC domain\u201d was highest in the cells that are in the DT, and expression decreased with increasing distance from the boundary. Expression of <i>vein</i> and of the Notch targets <i>Hindsight</i> and <i>Fizzy-related</i> appeared to correlate with the level of Notch activation in the proximal DB (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I\u2013K</a>). <i>vein</i> expression was highest in the cells with the most NRE-<i>GFP</i> expression, but expression of <i>Hindsight</i> and <i>Fizzy-related</i> in the DB was not detected in the cells with highest levels of Notch activation.

Similar clonal analysis studies of the wing imaginal disc revealed that in different discs, clones occupied varied locations and produced varied shapes in the wing, indicating that the descendants of particular single cells do not generate designated areas (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bryant, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973</a>). The clone borders were \u201cwiggly\u201d except at compartment borders where they were straight (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib37\">Lawrence and Struhl, 1996</a>). Although the tracheal branches are tubes, not epithelial sheets, we were able to map clones in the DT, DB and TC. Most of the clones arose in the DT (as expected because of the greater relative number of founder cells), and the number of cells around its circumference was large enough that we were able to evaluate the contours of DT clones."

The clone frequency for regimens A and F were low and few specimens had more than one marked patch. Clone frequency for regimens B-E, G, H was greater: most DTs had clones, most DTs with clones had an average of more than one discrete patch of marked cells, and because many marked areas included more than 32 cells (the period during L3 when the cells divide after clone induction limits the number of mitoses to a maximum of five), these areas must be the descendants of more than one founder cell and represent more than one clone. Nevertheless, the clonal patches we observed in the DT, DB and TC appeared to have located randomly in these branches, and clones in the DT appeared to have \u201cwiggly\u201d borders except at the boundaries that delimit the DT, DB and TC expression domains. Among the 361 specimens we analyzed that had marked cells, 202 marked patches were identified that lined a portion of these borders. Ten example specimens are shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and the others are in the <a href=\"#fig4s1 fig4s2 fig4s3 fig4s4 fig4s5 fig4s6 fig4s7\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1\u20137</a>.

These borders were identified by morphology, by expression of NRE-<i>lacZ</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,G</a>), and in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4 (C,D)</a>, by the juxtaposition of two clones that had been independently generated and differentially marked, and precisely correlated with Ser expression."

Although 26 other specimens had marked cells on both sides of the DT/DB border (<a href=\"#fig4s7\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 7</a>), these specimens had multiple large patches of marked cells that in combination averaged 34% ( \u00b1 23%, std. dev.) coverage of the DT surface. It is most likely therefore that the patches that meet on either side of the DT/TC border represent more than one clone and therefore are not inconsistent with the model we propose - that the DT/DB border is also a line of clonal restriction."

Because the number of specimens with marked DT patches at the border (55) was similar to the number of specimens with marked TC cells (62), we conclude that the number of cells on either side of the DT/TC border at the time of recombination was approximately the same. And because the number of specimens with marked cells on both sides of the DT/TC border (15/102) relative to those with clones only on one side (DT only (40) TC only (47) = 87/102) is consistent with the expected number of independent clones in the DT and TC domains, we suggest that the DT/TC border is also a line of clonal restriction."

In contrast to marked control clones in the DT, which integrated with their unmarked neighbors and were not morphologically distinct (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), clones that lacked sal function appeared to sort out from their neighbors and to bulge abnormally from the plane of the trunk tube (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013F</a>). The <i>sal</i> mutant cells expressed Kni and <i>vein</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>) but did not express either Delta or Cut (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,E</a>). All the mutant cells expressed NRE-<i>lacZ</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). We also analyzed clones that ectopically expressed <i>kni</i>, and they also appeared to sort out; and they expressed <i>vein</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). This expression signature (<i>vein</i>, Kni, Sal<sup>-</sup>, Delta<sup>-</sup>, Cut<sup>-</sup>) is the same as that of DB cells, suggesting that sal function is required for DT identity and that without sal function or with Kni, they transform to DB identity. The sorting out phenotype is consistent with the idea that the presence of mutant cells created an ectopic juxtaposition of cells with different identities. Expression of NRE-<i>lacZ</i> in the mutant cells that lacked sal function (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>) suggests that Notch signaling was activated at the ectopic borders that formed where the two groups of cells abut, just as it does at the normal DT/DB junction."

It is the only Drosophila organ generated by a tubulogenesis process that combines both cell division and morphogenesis, and it is therefore the only system to which the power of Drosophila developmental genetics can be applied to address the question that instigated the study described here \u2013 are cells that re-initiate cell cycling in a fully differentiated tubular organ (specifically in the L3 Tr2) descendants of un-differentiated subgroups (stem cells?), or do the differentiated cells re-enter mitotic cycling? Our initial assumption was that the tracheal remodeling is a product of pools of adult tracheoblasts that grow and assume a functional role only after the larval periods, but our previous studies showed that DT re-population in Tr2 involves the activation of mitotic cycling in differentiated larval cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Guha et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sato et al., 2008</a>). However, these studies did not establish whether the dividing cells represent a selected and specialized subgroup, or whether re-entry into the cell cycle was a general feature of the DT cells. The results of the clonal analysis reported here supports the idea that most or all cells in the early L3 DT contribute to re-population, and because their descendants can fully account for repopulation, we conclude that there is no other cell type involved. The varied locations and shapes of the clones suggest that the cells in the L3 DT constitute an equivalence group. Previous studies of re-population of the DB came to a similar conclusion (<a href=\"#bib61\">Weaver and Krasnow, 2008</a>)."

DB clones that over-expressed <i>sal</i> ectopically activated Notch signaling in adjacent cells and DT clones of <i>sal</i> mutant cells induced Notch signaling and also appeared to sort out from their neighbors.

We do not yet understand the basis for the variability, but assume that it represents a transient state and that these large cells begin to divide later than the others. If true, they likely prevent dividing cells on the DT and TC side from mixing, but this does not argue against the existence of a compartment border. The activation of Notch signaling and the fact that the Cut identity of the TC cells is sensitive to the presence of Sal support the idea that there is one and a model in which the DT represents a development compartment that is segregated from the DB and TC.

Although the concepts were instrumental to understanding the function of the genes that segment the early embryo when these genes were later discovered, and although discoveries of developmental compartments in other imaginal discs and in the abdominal histoblast nests followed, their generality has remained an open question because the types of tissues in which they were found represent a limited subset. Studies that map gene expression in developing tissues have identified many examples in which expression is restricted to well-defined domains, and some studies have correlated these domains with cell lineage (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buchon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Marianes and Spradling, 2013</a>), but it is not known whether these cases satisfy other criteria that have been ascribed to developmental compartments - such as association with signaling centers and developmental polarity. Although we do not know if all these criteria are important distinctions, we prefer to reserve the term developmental compartments for contexts that have them. Using this strict definition, the studies reported here are the first to identify developmental compartments in an internal tubular organ. We did not initiate these studies expecting to find developmental compartments, but discovered them in the course of a thorough clonal analysis. It is possible that similar studies may also find them in other internal organs, and in particular in the vascular system of vertebrates that are also branched and have regions with distinct identities."

It is also a major issue, for one of the strengths of the work is that, just like in the wing imaginal disc, the lineage borders described here are associated with Notch signaling, which is presumably necessary for the formation and maintenance of those borders. The authors show the Notch function is necessary for normal morphogenesis of the dorsal branch, but the requirement of Notch signaling for the maintenance of the DT/DB or the DT/TC boundaries has not been investigated. The authors should perform additional experiments to address this problem. For example, as indicated by an expert reviewer, it should be possible to conduct a lineage experiment in trachea depleted of Notch function (<i>btl &gt;NotchRNAi</i>) to check on the stability of the DT/DB border under those conditions."

This is the first demonstration of developmental compartments in a branched organ, and it will be interesting to find out whether other branched organs are also organized in a similar manner.

This repopulation is an example of organ renewal and cell division by differentiated cells. The authors have now further investigated this repopulation phenomenon. By conducting lineage analyses they found that the repopulating cells do not intrude into adjacent tracheal branches (lineage restriction). This fits with the notion that the branches behave as developmental compartments. Adjacent developmental compartments are distinguished by differences in the expression of particular genes, such as selector genes. The authors found that in Tr2, adjacent branches could indeed be distinguished based on the expression of such genes. Clonal depletion (e.g. Sal<sup>-</sup>) in compartments where they are expressed led to a sorting out from the neighboring cells and the acquisition of gene expression patterns seen in the adjacent compartment. Notch activity is highest in the DB cells at the branch sites. Depletion of Notch in trachea led to a morphological defect at the proximal DB. Taken together with other observations the authors propose that the Tr2 represent developmental compartments."

If the pattern is very specific, then an unknown, Tr2-specific signal might impose both lineage restrictions and repopulation, and such a finding could explain why Tr2 is repopulated.

Regionalization depends on localized domains of gene expression (usually transcription factors) that confer compartment-specific identity. Signaling systems including Notch and Ephrin/Eph have been implicated in boundary formation and maintenance. Here, Rao et al explore the proliferation in the tracheal system, and provide evidence for a boundary of lineage restriction that coincides with gene expression domains. They present reasonable evidence that cells respect a boundary between dorsal trunk and dorsal branch that coincides with a domain of Spalt and Knirps expression, and some evidence that local activation of Notch signaling may be involved. Much of what is described is analogous to the roles of transcription factors and localized Notch activation in imaginal disc compartment systems, though much of this parallel is not explored in the text. The novelty here lies in the finding of these relationships within the tracheal system, in which the tubular epithelium has a different topology that the flat imaginal disc epithelia."

This is a criticism raised by all the reviewers. It is also a major issue, for one of the strengths of the work is that, just like in the wing imaginal disc, the lineage borders described here are associated with Notch signaling, which is presumably necessary for the formation and maintenance of those borders. The authors show the Notch function is necessary for normal morphogenesis of the dorsal branch, but the requirement of Notch signaling for the maintenance of the DT/DB or the DT/TC boundaries has not been investigated. The authors should perform additional experiments to address this problem. For example, as indicated by an expert reviewer, it should be possible to conduct a lineage experiment in trachea depleted of Notch function</i> (btl &gt;NotchRNAi) <i>to check on the stability of the DT/DB border under those conditions. Another problem is that the novelty of the results, that is, the functional connection between lineage restrictions, transcription factors and Notch signaling in building a tubular structure like the trachea, does not come out clearly in the manuscript. The authors should try to put their work in the context of what is known about the D/V border in the wing disc.</i> "
