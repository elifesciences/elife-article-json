Gender-appropriate production of the sexually dimorphic transcription factors doublesex and fruitless controls sexual differentiation and sexual behavior. <i>miR-124</i> mutant males exhibited increased male\u2013male courtship and reduced reproductive success with females. Females showed a strong preference for wild-type males over <i>miR-124</i> mutant males when given a choice of mates. These effects were traced to aberrant pheromone production. We identified the sex-specific splicing factor <i>transformer</i> as a functionally significant target of <i>miR-124</i> in this context, suggesting a role for <i>miR-124</i> in the control of male sexual differentiation and behavior, by limiting inappropriate expression of the female form of <i>transformer</i>. <i>miR-124</i> is required to ensure fidelity of gender-appropriate pheromone production in males. Use of a microRNA provides a secondary means of controlling the cascade of sex-specific splicing events that controls sexual differentiation in <i>Drosophila</i>."

Gender-appropriate production of the sexually dimorphic transcription factors doublesex and fruitless controls sexual differentiation and sexual behavior. <i>miR-124</i> mutant males exhibited increased male\u2013male courtship and reduced reproductive success with females. Females showed a strong preference for wild-type males over <i>miR-124</i> mutant males when given a choice of mates. These effects were traced to aberrant pheromone production. We identified the sex-specific splicing factor <i>transformer</i> as a functionally significant target of <i>miR-124</i> in this context, suggesting a role for <i>miR-124</i> in the control of male sexual differentiation and behavior, by limiting inappropriate expression of the female form of <i>transformer</i>. <i>miR-124</i> is required to ensure fidelity of gender-appropriate pheromone production in males. Use of a microRNA provides a secondary means of controlling the cascade of sex-specific splicing events that controls sexual differentiation in <i>Drosophila</i>."

Mutant males perfumed with cVA showed a significant improvement in their ability to achieve copulation with control females (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, *p&lt;0.05). We also examined the effects of perfuming on male courtship behavior. Decapitated <i>miR-124</i> mutant males were perfumed with cVA and used as targets in the male\u2013male courtship assay. There was no significant difference between courtship of targets perfumed with cVA or with the hexane solvent alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; the perfuming protocol restored cVA to &lt;50% the level on control flies, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The cVA-perfumed <i>miR-124</i> mutant target males also have elevated levels of the pentacosene pheromones. Thus, the perfumed mutant males are expected to give mixed excitatory and inhibitory courtship signals. In this context, the level of cVA reached by perfuming may be insufficient to fully rescue male\u2013male courtship, while being sufficient to restore male\u2013female courtship.

If elevated <i>tra</i><sup><i>F</i></sup> expression contributes to the <i>miR-124</i> mutant phenotype, we would expect reducing <i>tra</i><sup><i>F</i></sup> levels to ameliorate the mutant phenotype. For these experiments, a <i>UAS-tra</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup> transgene was expressed under <i>miR-124-Gal4</i> control in the <i>miR-124</i> mutant background. The transgene targets a region common to both the female and non-sex-specific splice forms. Lowering <i>tra</i><sup><i>F</i></sup> levels in the <i>miR-124</i> expressing cells was sufficient to increase male\u2013female mating success (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>); to reduce male\u2013male courtship (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), to improve production of cVA by several fold (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), and to lower levels of 9-pentacosene (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>).

The Sxl splicing factor is produced in genetic females and competes with U2AF, an essential splicing factor, for binding to a splice site in the <i>tra</i> primary transcript. In the presence of sufficient Sxl, U2AF binds to a lower affinity site and promotes splicing to produce the female-specific <i>tra</i><sup><i>F</i></sup> transcript (<a href=\"#bib44\">Valcarcel et al., 1993</a>). Nonetheless, low-levels of the female-specific <i>Sxl</i> and <i>tra</i><sup><i>F</i></sup> transcripts have been observed in males (this report; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tarone et al., 2005</a>). In the case of <i>tra</i><sup><i>F</i></sup>, this might reflect a low-level of U2AF binding to the low affinity site, even in the absence of Sxl. Leaky low-level expression of Sxl in males could be another contributing factor. Under normal conditions, the level of <i>traF</i> transcript found in males appears to be innocuous."

Interestingly, the modest increase in the level of <i>tra</i><sup><i>F</i></sup> in <i>miR-124</i> mutant males led to reduced splicing of <i>dsx</i> to produce <i>dsx</i><sup><i>M</i></sup>, but we did not observe a corresponding increase in the production of the female splice form <i>dsx</i><sup><i>F</i></sup> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Production of <i>dsx</i><sup><i>F</i></sup> requires the assembly of a complex containing Tra<sup>F</sup> protein along with Tra2 and SR proteins at a series of sites that comprise the female-specific splice enhancer (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lynch and Maniatis, 1996</a>). Our findings suggest that a modest increase in the level of Tra<sup>F</sup> protein can interfere with production of <i>dsx</i><sup><i>M</i></sup> without leading to production of <i>dsx</i><sup><i>F</i></sup>. If low levels of Tra<sup>F</sup> protein can lead to assembly of non-functional complexes, it is possible that their binding to the female-specific splice enhancer, might compromise male splicing without effectively promoting female splicing."

Many of the characteristic male compounds are also synthesized by the oenocytes, since genetic ablation of these cells abolished all male hydrocarbon production, but does not affect levels of cVA, produced in the ejaculatory bulb (<a href=\"#bib3\">Billeter et al., 2009</a>). However, feminization of the nervous system in XY males led to significant elevation of characteristic male hydrocarbons such as cis-7-tricosene and cis-9-pentacosene, although no gain of female hydrocarbons was observed (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fernandez et al., 2010</a>). Brain specific depletion of <i>desat1,</i> which encodes a desaturase enzyme involved in pheromone biosynthesis, was shown to alter pheromone production (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bousquet et al., 2012</a>). We noted the presence of unconventional sites that potentially could be targeted by <i>miR-124</i> in the open reading frame and 5\u2032 UTR of the <i>desat1</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). The function of these sites has not been tested. If functional, <i>desat1</i> could be overexpressed in the <i>miR-124</i> mutant. While the consequences of elevated Desat1 expression are not known, the possibility exists that <i>miR-124</i> might act via multiple targets in the CNS to indirectly modulate pheromone production in peripheral tissues. In moths, the neuropeptide PBAN has been linked to control of pheromone production, suggesting a role for neuroendocrine control of sexual differentiation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jurenka and Rafaeli, 2011</a>). Our findings provide evidence that <i>miR-124</i> regulation of <i>transformer</i> may act in the context of neuroendocrine control of male pheromone production."

The hexane was evaporated under a gentle flow of nitrogen, leaving the compound as a residue coating the bottom of the vial. Flies were briefly anaesthetized on ice, transferred to coated vials in groups of seven, and subjected to three vortex pulses lasting 20 s each, with 10 s pauses between each pulse. The perfumed flies were allowed to recover for about 1 hr in fresh vials with standard food. Six flies from each group were used for behavioral tests and the remaining fly was subjected to hydrocarbon analysis by Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry to monitor effective transfer of the test compound to the flies."

Mass accuracy is within \u00b115 ppm. The DART interface was operated using the following settings: the gas heater was set to 200\u00b0C, the glow discharge needle was set at 3.5 kV. Electrode 1 was set to +150 V and electrode 2 was set to +250 V. He<sub>2</sub> gas flow was set to 2.5 l/min. Under these conditions, mostly protonated ([M + H]<sup>+</sup>) molecules are observed. Using clean forceps, an anaesthetized fly was picked up by both wings, making sure not to damage the fly. The fly was placed in a stream of charged helium gas until peaks of triacylglycerides start to appear. All fly samples were placed approximately in the same location in the DART source for the same amount of time in order to obtain reproducible spectra. Six flies from each genotype were measured. Polyethylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as calibrant. Relative quantification of compound abundance was performed by normalizing the areas under the signal corresponding to cVA ([M + H]<sup>+</sup> 311.29) to the tricosene signal ([M + H]<sup>+</sup> 323.36). DART MS is unable to differentiate isoforms of tricosene therefore the tricosene signal represents the summed signal intensity from 5, 7, and 9-Tricosene. Tricosene was selected as the normalization peak due to the unaltered levels in mutants compared to CS controls in GC-MS."

These behavioral defects of <i>miR-124</i> mutants, as well as associated changes in production of the pheromone cVA, are linked to increased expression of transformer (<i>tra</i>), a splicing factor that regulates the male-specific splicing of its downstream targets, <i>dsx</i> and <i>fru</i>. Several lines of evidence show <i>tra</i> to be a target of <i>miR-124</i>, and reduction of <i>tra</i> is shown to suppress <i>miR-124</i> mutant phenotypes. As cVA is a cuticular hydrocarbon of males flies that mediates male\u2013female attraction, as well as male\u2013male repulsion, several of the behavioral defects of <i>miR-124</i> are proposed to be explained by the dysregulation of one downstream target, <i>tra</i>, and its role in the production of sex-specific pheromones. Together, this supports a model in which endogenous <i>miR-124</i> (and therefore potentially other miRNAs) act to suppress phenotypes that may result from the leaky regulation of tissue and sex-specific mRNA splicing."
