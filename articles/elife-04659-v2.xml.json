Although nuclear export of tRNAs has been well documented, the import machinery is poorly understood. Here, we identified Ssa2p, a major cytoplasmic Hsp70 in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, as a tRNA-binding protein whose deletion compromises nuclear accumulation of tRNAs upon nutrient starvation. Ssa2p recognizes several structural features of tRNAs through its nucleotide-binding domain, but prefers loosely-folded tRNAs, suggesting that Ssa2p has a chaperone-like activity for RNAs. Ssa2p also binds Nup116, one of the yeast nucleoporins. Sis1p and Ydj1p, cytoplasmic co-chaperones for Ssa proteins, were also found to contribute to the tRNA import. These results unveil a novel function of the Ssa2p system as a tRNA carrier for nuclear import by a novel mode of substrate recognition. Such Ssa2p-mediated tRNA import likely contributes to quality control of cytosolic tRNAs."

Although nuclear export of tRNAs has been well documented, the import machinery is poorly understood. Here, we identified Ssa2p, a major cytoplasmic Hsp70 in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, as a tRNA-binding protein whose deletion compromises nuclear accumulation of tRNAs upon nutrient starvation. Ssa2p recognizes several structural features of tRNAs through its nucleotide-binding domain, but prefers loosely-folded tRNAs, suggesting that Ssa2p has a chaperone-like activity for RNAs. Ssa2p also binds Nup116, one of the yeast nucleoporins. Sis1p and Ydj1p, cytoplasmic co-chaperones for Ssa proteins, were also found to contribute to the tRNA import. These results unveil a novel function of the Ssa2p system as a tRNA carrier for nuclear import by a novel mode of substrate recognition. Such Ssa2p-mediated tRNA import likely contributes to quality control of cytosolic tRNAs."

Los1p/exportin-t is considered as a primary export carrier of mature tRNAs in yeast, plants, and vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arts et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hellmuth et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kutay et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sarkar and Hopper, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Li and Chen, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Park et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cook et al., 2009</a>). Besides, yeast Los1p exports pre-tRNAs for cytoplasmic splicing (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sarkar and Hopper, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yoshihisa et al., 2003</a>). Msn5p/exportin-5, another importin \u03b2 homologue, provides an alternative export pathway in yeast and mammals (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bohnsack et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Calado et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Takano et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Okada et al., 2009</a>) while Msn5p/exportin-5 is the main carrier of tRNAs in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">B\u00fcssing et al., 2010</a>). These importin \u03b2 proteins appear to play different but overlapping roles in the export of mature tRNAs in the yeast; Los1p exports both newly synthesized and re-imported tRNAs while Msn5p exports only re-imported tRNAs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Eswara et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Murthi et al., 2010</a>).

Nuclear import of tRNAs can be blocked by depletion of intracellular ATP, indicating that the process is energy-dependent. However, tRNA import can also operate even in the absence of a gradient of GTP-bound Ran across the NE, which is the main energy source for many macromolecular transport mediated by importin \u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib66\">Takano et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gr\u00fcnwald et al., 2011</a>). It is known that various types of tRNAs are imported into the nucleus. Both authentic tRNAs and some types of damaged tRNAs, such as CCA-less tRNAs, are imported (<a href=\"#bib66\">Takano et al., 2005</a>). Wybutosine formation on tRNA-Phe<sub>GAA</sub> is initiated by nuclear Trm5p after cytoplasmic splicing of pre-tRNA-Phe<sub>GAA</sub>, indicating that nuclear import of a spliced intermediate precedes this modification (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ohira and Suzuki, 2011</a>). In addition, spliced tRNA species but hypomodified and possessing 5\u2032- and 3\u2032 extensions, which are accidentally leaked from the nucleus in certain mutants, are retrograded into the nucleus to be repaired or degraded (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kramer and Hopper, 2013</a>). These findings are in great contrast to the above-mentioned selective export of aminoacylated mature tRNAs. Collectively, tRNA import and export mechanisms with different specificities were predicted to maintain the quality of pre-existing mature tRNAs in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib75\">Yoshihisa, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kramer and Hopper, 2013</a>). However, identity of the carrier that mediates tRNA import remains totally unknown. One possible import carrier is an importin-\u03b2 homologue Mtr10p, which was originally identified as an import carrier for Npl3p, as mRNA-binding protein (<a href=\"#bib60\">Senger et al., 1998</a>), and was shown to cause a defect in tRNA import when mutated (<a href=\"#bib59\">Shaheen and Hopper, 2005</a>).

For instance, depletion of various nutrients, such as amino acids, phosphate, and glucose, results in nuclear accumulation of tRNAs in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hurto et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Whitney et al., 2007</a>). Indeed, such alteration of tRNA localization affects translation efficiency of certain mRNAs that encode enzymes for amino acid biosynthesis, suggesting that retrieval of tRNAs from the cytosol has, at least, a regulatory role (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chu and Hopper, 2013</a>). To alter the tRNA balance, signal transduction pathways mediated by PKA and TOR, but not Gcn2p, facilitate this transport regulation in the yeast (<a href=\"#bib72\">Whitney et al., 2007</a>). Although several kinases were shown to act on the regulation of tRNA transport, tRNA export carriers Los1p or Msn5p are not phosphorylated in vivo according to the nutrient status, and they are not substrates for PKA in vitro (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pierce et al., 2014</a>). Similar regulation could operate not only in fungi, but also in mammals (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shaheen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Miyagawa et al., 2012</a>), while some reports argue that this is specific to some fungal species (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chafe et al., 2011</a>). A model was proposed that, while tRNA import is constitutive, export is fine-tuned, depending on the growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Eswara et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Murthi et al., 2010</a>). However, evidence is lacking for constitutive import of tRNAs at the same rate irrespective of nutrient conditions. It is thus essential to identify the factors mediating the tRNA import, which are possible targets of the regulation."

We previously showed that both full-length and CCA-less tRNAs are imported into the nucleus, and that this nuclear import is ATP-dependent (<a href=\"#bib66\">Takano et al., 2005</a>). Thus, we postulated that the putative import carrier(s) does not recognize the 3\u2032 end of tRNAs and binds tRNAs in a nucleotide triphosphate-dependent or sensitive manner. To identify such proteins, tRNA-agarose was prepared, in which yeast tRNAs were immobilized via their 3\u2032 ends (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Next, a yeast cytosolic fraction depleted of endogenous tRNAs by anion exchange chromatography was applied to the tRNA-agarose in the presence or absence of 3 mM ATP. Bound proteins were subsequently eluted from the tRNA-agarose with 1.5 M NaCl. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, the intensity of some bands varied depending on the absence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> closed arrowheads) or presence of ATP (open arrowheads). Bands in the eluates marked by arrows were then subjected to peptide fingerprinting. As summarized in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, Tef1p (eEF1A in the yeast) and Eno2p (enolase) were identified, both of which are already known as tRNA binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nagata et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Entelis et al., 2006</a>). In addition, RNA binding proteins, such as Pab1p, Gbp2p and Sro9p, were also detected. Among the proteins associated with the tRNA-resin in an ATP-sensitive manner, Ssa1p and/or Ssa2p, two major cytosolic Hsp70s with highly homologous sequences, were of interest because mammalian Hsp70 (Hsc70) was shown to interact with an AU-rich element, which defines short-lived mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Henics et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Laroia et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lu et al., 2006</a>). In addition, the yeast <i>ssa1</i> mutant strain exhibits defective degradation of mRNAs possessing this AU-rich element (<a href=\"#bib15\">Duttagupta et al., 2003</a>).

First, an <i>ssa1\u2206</i> or <i>ssa2\u2206</i> mutation was introduced into the <i>los1\u2206 msn5\u2206</i> strain, and the localization of tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub>, encoded by intron-containing genes and initiator tRNA-Met (tRNA-iMet) encoded by intronless genes was analyzed by FISH. Under normal growth conditions, the <i>los1\u2206 msn5\u2206</i> cells accumulate large amounts of mature tRNAs in the nucleus. This tRNA gradient across the NE was abolished by treating the cells with 2-deoxyglucose and NaN<sub>3</sub> and was re-established by removing these drugs in the presence of thiolutin, an inhibitor of all the three RNA polymerases (<a href=\"#bib66\">Takano et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). If Ssa2p is involved in the nuclear import of tRNAs, the <i>los1\u2206 msn5\u2206 ssa2\u2206</i> mutant would accumulate less mature tRNAs in the nucleus and fail to re-establish the tRNA gradient across the NE during energy recovery. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, neither the <i>ssa1\u2206</i> nor <i>ssa2\u2206</i> mutants exhibits altered tRNA localization in a <i>los1\u2206 msn5\u2206</i> background. Furthermore, <i>ssa2\u2206</i> mutant cells re-established the tRNA gradient across the NE after energy depletion like the other strains (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, bottom row). These results indicate that neither Ssa2p nor Ssa1p plays a major role in tRNA import under normal growth conditions."

Wild-type, <i>ssa1\u2206</i>, and <i>ssa2\u2206</i> cells cultured in the YPD medium were transferred to the amino acid-starvation medium SD+Ura, Ade (SD), and the localization of tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> and tRNA-iMet was analyzed by FISH. While the wild-type and <i>ssa1\u2206</i> cells accumulated both tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> and tRNA-iMet in the nucleus under these conditions within 2 hr, relatively lower amounts of tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> and tRNA-iMet were observed in the <i>ssa2\u2206</i> nuclei (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We also examined three other tRNA species, tRNA-Lys<sub>CUU</sub>, tRNA-Lys<sub>UUU</sub>, and tRNA-Tyr<sub>GUA</sub>, in FISH, and found that all the tRNAs were apparently affected by <i>ssa2\u2206</i> mutation while the effects of <i>ssa1\u2206</i> mutation were not obvious if any (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The extent of nuclear accumulation under starvation conditions and the effect of <i>ssa2\u2206</i> were variable among tRNA species (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and its supplement). To confirm difference of the two <i>ssa</i> mutations in tRNA accumulation upon starvation more in detail, quantitative analyses of the FISH images were carried out (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, table). While the average nuclear accumulation indices (NAIs), rations of nuclear FISH signals against cytosolic signals, of tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> in the wild-type, <i>ssa1\u2206</i>, and <i>ssa2\u2206</i> cells were nearly equal when the cells were grown in YPD, the NAIs of these strains became 1.52 \u00b1 0.09, 1.58 \u00b1 0.10, and 1.14 \u00b1 0.25, respectively, when the cells were starved, revealing an apparent difference between tRNA import in the wild-type cells and that in the <i>ssa2\u2206</i> cells. We noticed that, under the starvation conditions, variation of NAIs of individual cells increased if compared with that in the rich medium (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) while average NAIs of biological replicates fell into a narrower range. Deletion of either of the other two <i>SSA</i> genes, <i>SSA3</i> and <i>SSA4</i>, which are only expressed under stress conditions, had no impact on tRNA accumulation under starvation conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, table). When the effect of simultaneous deletion of <i>SSA1</i> and <i>SSA2</i> genes was examined, the double deletion did not result in the obvious additive effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Similar results were obtained when distribution of tRNA-iMet was quantified (data not shown)."

Thus, we examined whether Ssa2p acts in the same pathway as Mtr10p, using an <i>ssa2\u2206 GAL7p-MTR10</i> double mutant strain. As some controversy exists regarding the involvement of Mtr10p in the tRNA import (<a href=\"#bib59\">Shaheen and Hopper, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chafe et al., 2011</a>), the promoter shut-off strain was used to circumvent any possible adaptation effects due to the <i>MTR10</i> deletion, which causes a strong growth defect. These strains were grown in YPGal medium and then grown in YPD for 18 hr to shut-off the expression of <i>MTR10</i> before being subjected to nutrient starvation. As reported by <a href=\"#bib59\">Shaheen and Hopper (2005)</a>, nuclear accumulation defects were evident in the <i>MTR10</i> shut-off strain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <i>mtr10</i>\u2193). The <i>MTR10</i> shut-off had a stronger effect on tRNA distribution than the <i>ssa2\u0394</i> single mutation. The double mutant showed an additive decrease in the signal intensity of nuclear tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <i>ssa2\u0394 mtr10</i>\u2193), and signal quantification revealed that the average NAI of the starved double mutant (0.87 \u00b1 0.04) was clearly below those observed for the <i>mtr10</i> and <i>ssa2\u0394</i> single mutants (0.98 \u00b1 0.04 and 1.11 \u00b1 0.07, respectively), and was far below that observed for the wild type strain (1.30 \u00b1 0.10). Student's <i>t</i>-test indicated that the probability that the NAIs of the <i>mtr10</i> single and <i>mtr10 ssa2\u2206</i> double mutants were the same was only 0.037 while the difference between those of the <i>mtr10</i> single and <i>mtr10 ssa1\u2206</i> double mutants was not significant (p = 0.92). Similar quantitative results were obtained for tRNA-iMet (data not shown). These results support the idea that Ssa2p and Mtr10p act independently in parallel pathways for tRNA import under starvation conditions."

In summary, these results indicate that Ssa2p plays a pivotal role in the nuclear import of tRNAs under starvation conditions, while the other Ssa proteins, including Ssa1p, have a minor, if not at all, role in this process.

Both Ssa1p and Ssa2p received radioactivity from <sup>32</sup>P-labeled tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> in an ATP-sensitive manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>) with only a marginal difference between the capacity of the two Ssa proteins to recognize the tRNA in vitro. This is in marked contrast to the effects of <i>ssa1\u2206</i> and <i>ssa2\u2206</i> mutations on tRNA import in vivo. Because a tRNA possesses an un-paired adenosine on its 3\u2032 terminus, this adenosine might be recognized by Ssa proteins as an analogue of ADP or ATP, which is usually bound by the nucleotide-binding cleft of Hsp70s. To exclude this possibility, label transfer was examined using CCA-less tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub>, which starts with the 5\u2032 guanosine and ends with the 3\u2032 cytidine. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, both Ssa1p and Ssa2p received radioactivity efficiently from the CCA-less tRNA. Label transfer with an intron-containing pre-tRNA was also performed and revealed that Ssa proteins bind tRNAs irrespective of their anticodon loop structure. When the specificity of tRNA recognition by Ssa proteins was tested by competition experiments with short RNAs, chemical amounts of in vitro-transcribed tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> efficiently competed with the radioactive amount of tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> for label transfer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, lanes \u2018tRNA\u2019) while only limited competition was observed with single-stranded homo-oligo-ribonucleotides (A<sub>30</sub>, U<sub>30</sub>, and G<sub>30</sub>) or a double-stranded homo-oligomer (A-U)<sub>30</sub>. These results indicate that Ssa proteins specifically recognize tRNAs in an ATP-sensitive manner via a mechanism that is not mediated through the 3\u2032 end adenosine or the anti-codon loop of tRNAs, and that these properties resemble those observed in vivo."

For this purpose, we first used hybridization of the tRNA substrate with an antisense oligonucleotide to disrupt the tRNA secondary structure. Indeed, an antisense oligonucleotide against the 5\u2032 half of tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub>, but not an unrelated oligonucleotide, inhibited the label transfer only when hybridized with the substrate by denaturation and annealing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Heat denaturation and quick cooling of the tRNA substrate alone did not affect label transfer efficiency, probably due to rapid refolding of the tRNA molecule. The above possibility was further tested with tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> mutants that exhibit altered tRNA structures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Introduction of G18A and U54C mutations, which disrupts the interaction between the D and T\u03a8C loops, reduced label transfer efficiency. On the other hand, destabilization of the acceptor stem by introducing G69C or G68C substitutions resulted in higher label transfer efficiency, while a C67G mutation reduced the efficiency of label transfer. Both of these positive and negative effects induced by acceptor stem mutations were minimized by compensatory mutations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, gray bars). Similar partial destabilization of the acceptor stem of other tRNA species is recognized as the degradation flag by CCA transferase to introduce an unusual CCACCA sequence instead of the normal CCA to the 3\u2032-end of the tRNAs (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wilusz et al., 2011</a>). We tested whether Ssa proteins also prefer such mutant tRNAs. Indeed, replacement of the acceptor stem of human tRNA-Leu<sub>AAG</sub> with acceptor-like stems from unstable tRNA-like noncoding RNAs (mouse MALAT1-associated cytoplasmic small RNA and MEM \u03b2 RNA) enhanced recognition by Ssa2p (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This is also true even for single replacement of the G1-C71 Watson-Crick pair with the non-Watson-Crick pair (G1\u2022U71) in tRNA-Arg<sub>UGC</sub>. These results suggest that Ssa proteins recognize the overall structure of tRNAs, and prefer tRNAs with a destabilized acceptor stem but with a stable core structure."

Hsp70 binds proteinaceous substrates through its SBD when its NBD binds ADP, and releases them when the NBD binds ATP (<a href=\"#bib78\">Young et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</a>). Thus, we examined whether Ssa proteins utilize their SBD for recognition of tRNAs. In the label transfer assay, increasing amounts of reduced and carboxymethylated lactalbumin (RCMLA), a model unfolded protein often used in chaperone assays, were added up to 10-fold molar excess of Ssa proteins. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, RCMLA addition did not inhibit, but rather moderately enhanced label transfer from tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub>. These results suggest that tRNAs are not recognized by Ssa proteins through their SBDs. To examine this notion further, purified glutathione-S transferase (GST)-fusions encompassing different Ssa domains were subjected to the label transfer assay. GST-NBD and GST-NBD-SBD fusions of Ssa1p and Ssa2p received radioactivity from tRNA-Pro<sub>UGG</sub> while fusions without NBD did not, indicating that the NBD plays an essential role in tRNA recognition by Ssa proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). It should be noted that the label transfer efficiencies of the GST-NBD and GST-NBD-SBD proteins were apparently lower than that of full-length Ssa proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, the left most 6 lanes). Therefore, the CVD appears to contribute to the efficient recognition of tRNAs by the NBD."

We introduced several mutations altering conserved amino acid residues in the nucleotide-binding cleft to GST-Ssa-NBD fusions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Mutations affecting efficiency of ATP hydrolysis and its activation, namely F66L and K69Q, enhanced tRNA binding while those compromising nucleotide binding/exchange (G199D) reduced the binding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Those mutations in the NBD that alter structural response to the nucleotide state (E228Q, D229N) caused virtually no changes in the tRNA binding. These results indicate that particular residues in the NBD are responsible for tRNA recognition by Ssa proteins, and that the structural features of the ATP/ADP binding state are important for the tRNA binding. Interestingly, the NBDs of Ssa1p and Ssa2p responded differently to these mutations; the Ssa1p-NBD responded more strongly to F66L and K69Q than the Ssa2p-NDB. More prominently, E173S and T201A, which affect the nucleotide binding/exchange, only caused negative effects on the Ssa2p-NBD, suggesting that these differences in in vitro-binding of tRNAs might be the reason why Ssa2p but not Ssa1p is responsible for nuclear import of tRNAs in vivo."

Hsp40/DnaJ co-chaperones accelerate the ATPase activity of Hsp70s and pass specific substrates to corresponding Hsp70s to control their functionality in a spatiotemporal manner, while co-chaperones, GrpE, Bag-1, and Hsp110, act as nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) (<a href=\"#bib78\">Young et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</a>). To examine whether certain yeast homologues of DnaJ are involved in nuclear accumulation of tRNAs under starvation conditions, three major cytoplasmic DnaJ proteins, Sis1p, and Ydj1p, which are specific for Ssa proteins, and Zuo1p, which is specific for another class of cytoplasmic Hsp70s, Ssb proteins, were chosen for further analyses. As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, both the <i>sis1-151</i> and <i>ydj1\u2206</i> mutants showed an apparent defect in the nuclear accumulation of tRNAs under starvation conditions while the <i>zuo1\u2206</i> mutant cells were able to accumulate tRNAs in the nucleus. This is consistent with the finding that Ssb1p and Ssb2p are excluded from the nucleus and stay in the cytoplasm while Ssa1p and Ssa2p shuttles between the two compartments (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shulga et al., 1999</a>), and indicates that DnaJ proteins specific for Ssa1p and Ssa2p are required for tRNA import. If the ATPase activation of Ssa2p is required for tRNA import in the cytosol, a nuclear NEF for Ssa2p may contribute to nuclear import, as in the case of GEF for Ran GTPase (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gr\u00fcnwald et al., 2011</a>). In yeast, such an NEF is Snl1p, a Bag-1 homologue localized on the nucleoplasmic side of the NE (<a href=\"#bib63a\">Sondermann et al., 2002</a>). In contrast to the case of <i>sis1-151</i> and <i>ydj1\u2206</i>, <i>snl1\u2206</i> did not affect nuclear accumulation of tRNAs under starvation conditions, indicating that Snl1p is not involved in this process. Nevertheless, the effects of the <i>sis1</i> and <i>ydj1</i> mutations support the assumption that the ATPase cycle of Ssa2p plays an essential role in tRNA import."

                        "text": "Hsp70 is a versatile Swiss Army knife for the protein world through its binding and releasing of protein substrates with destabilized structures (<a href=\"#bib70\">Werner-Washburne et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nelson et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">James et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Daugaard et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Vos et al., 2008</a>). Unexpectedly, in the biochemical search for factors driving the nuclear import of tRNAs, we identified a major cytosolic Hsp70, Ssa2p, as a novel tRNA-binding protein that affects tRNA distribution under starvation conditions. Although Ssa2p has a highly homologous counterpart, Ssa1p, our findings, especially in vivo results, revealed difference between Ssa2p and Ssa1p in their involvement in nuclear import of tRNAs. And the following lines of evidence support the idea that Ssa2p has a novel function in intracellular dynamics of tRNAs as their nuclear import carrier. First, the <i>ssa2\u2206</i>, but not <i>ssa1\u2206</i>, mutant is defective in nuclear accumulation of the tRNAs analyzed so far under nutrient starvation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Besides, the <i>ssa1\u2206 ssa2\u2206</i> double mutant does not show any additive defect in tRNA import (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Because we have not analyzed all the isodecoder tRNAs in the yeast, there remains a possibility that nuclear import of certain tRNAs is driven by Ssa1p. Second, Ssa2p binds various tRNA species specifically and directly both in vivo and in vitro, while tRNA binding of Ssa1p was only observed in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D, 4</a>). We noticed that mutations in the conserved residues in the NBD of the Ssa proteins affect the tRNA binding ability in vitro differently between Ssa1p and Ssa2p (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). A possible explanation for the difference between the in vivo and in vitro results is that, in vivo, an auxiliary factor(s), such as co-chaperones regulating the ATPase cycle of Ssa2p, may confer specificity to Ssa2p as a tRNA import factor, or that the small difference in the tRNA binding of the two NBDs in vitro is enhanced to yield labor assignment between Ssa1p and Ssa2p in vivo when these multi-functional proteins are surrounded by variety of protein and RNA substrates. Third, Ssa proteins are known to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and their nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution is regulated according to environmental conditions (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shulga et al., 1999</a>). Indeed, we observed a marginal but reproducible increase in the nuclear pool of Ssa2p-FLAG upon amino acid starvation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Such alteration of transport carrier distribution was reported recently for Los1p, Msn5p, so on upon glucose starvation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Huang and Hopper, 2014</a>). Fourth, Ssa proteins interact with the FG-repeat region of Nup116p, and support association of tRNAs to Nup116p, suggesting that Ssa2p can enter the NPC with tRNAs under certain conditions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Fifth, we demonstrated the involvement of Sis1p and Ydj1p, major cytoplasmic DnaJs for Ssa proteins, in tRNA import in vivo, while such effect is not observed in the <i>zuo1\u2206</i> mutant, which is defective in Ssb-protein specific DnaJ (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). These results collectively suggest that tRNA loading onto Ssa2p may be assisted by these cytosolic co-chaperones specific for the Ssa proteins, and ATP hydrolysis by Ssa2p may drive upward transport of tRNAs across the NPC. Therefore, Ssa2p is the first factor that assists tRNA import by direct binding to tRNAs, shuttles between the cytosol and the nucleus, interacts with the NPC component, and couples the tRNA transport with energy release."

However, the <i>ssa2\u2206</i> and <i>mtr10</i>-shut off double mutant exhibited an additive defect in tRNA accumulation as compared with single mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). While this additive effect was not so significant, the difference between the double mutant and the single mutants was statistically meaningful. Although we could not completely negate the above possibility so far, these data rather support the idea that Ssa2p and Mtr10p form parallel and independent pathways, as the case of Los1p and Msn5p in tRNA export. Another potential non-importin candidate for an Ssa2p import carrier is Opi10p, a yeast homologue of Hikeshi, which functions as a nuclear import carrier of mammalian Hsp70 under heat stress conditions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kose et al., 2012</a>). However, our preliminary experiments suggest that the <i>opi10\u2206</i> mutant does not affect localization of Ssa1p or Ssa2p under normal or starvation conditions (data not shown). Although there are several other possibilities for involvement of the Ssa2p chaperone system in tRNA import, from the collective pieces of experimental results, we primarily propose that Ssa2p acts as an import carrier of tRNAs across the NPC. Since the <i>ssa2\u2206</i> phenotype is only obvious under starvation conditions, Ssa2p may provide a secondary pathway to accommodate high demand for the tRNA import under these conditions. In other words, the Ssa2p pathway may confer a regulatory capability to the tRNA nuclear import, responding to growth conditions like the case of tRNA export (<a href=\"#bib47\">Murthi et al, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Huang and Hopper, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pierce et al., 2014</a>). We speculate that Ssa2p also has some contribution to basal nuclear import of tRNAs under normal conditions by co-operating with the Mtr10p pathway, and that quantitative regulation of the Ssa2p pathway, but not complete on-and-off, enables enhancement of nuclear import under starvation conditions."

We also found that tRNA binding takes place through the NBD, but not through the SBD, of Ssa proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). On the other hand, Ssa proteins bind tRNAs that lack an adenosine at their 3' terminus, so that a tRNA molecule is not just a mimic of monomeric adenine nucleotides (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Examination of the crystal structure of bovine Hsc70 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>) indicates that the ATP-binding cleft is too narrow to accommodate the acceptor stem of the tRNA molecule while the several mutations introduced into this region affected tRNA binding of Ssa proteins, especially Ssa2p (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), suggesting that the ATP/ADP-binding state of Ssa2p alters an unidentified tRNA-binding interface on the NBD."

In addition, Ssa proteins prefer unmodified tRNAs to fully-modified tRNAs for their binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Therefore, Ssa proteins appear to recognize some characteristics of the three-dimensional structure of tRNA molecules, though preferably loosely-folded structures of tRNAs. Although the tRNA import system(s) seems to accept a variety of tRNA species, including matured and stably folded tRNAs (<a href=\"#bib66\">Takano et al., 2005</a>), such preference for unmodified or loosely-folded tRNAs may well contribute to the quality control of cytosolic tRNAs. Recent studies of rapid tRNA decay (RTD), which degrades hypomodified aberrant tRNAs in the cytosol, revealed that the RTD system also recognizes tRNAs with some defects in their acceptor stem, and a part of such aberrant tRNAs are degraded by the nuclear exonuclease Rat1p (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexandrov et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Whipple et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wilusz et al., 2011</a>). Because the above characteristics of the NBD of Ssa proteins are similar to those of the SBD with respect to protein binding (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deshaies et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tanaka et al., 2002</a>), we postulate that the NBD possesses a chaperone-like activity for tRNAs in recognizing their structural features, and may contribute to substrate selection for the nuclear RTD through tRNA import, if such tRNAs escape from the cytoplasmic RTD."

An attractive idea is that tRNA import is driven by the ATPase cycle of the Hsp70 in a similar manner to the nuclear import driven by the Ran GTPase cycle. The Ssa2p-mediated pathway may function as a regulatory pathway for tRNA import to adapt nutrient stress by using the heat-shock protein in a novel mode of action. Future studies should reveal the detailed molecular mechanism, by which Hsp70 contributes to tRNA import into the nucleus and its regulation upon nutrient stress."

We also noticed that there are several possibilities of indirect involvement of Ssa2p in nuclear import of tRNAs, such as a substrate selector or mediator for import carrier loading, etc<i>.</i>, but did not mention these in the original version in detail to clarify our main interpretation. As suggested by the reviewers, we tested whether Ssa proteins can interact with nucleoporins, and allow tRNAs to interact with nucleoporins by solution binding assays. As shown in the new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and corresponding description in Results \u201cSsa proteins interact with a certain nucleoporin\u201d, we could demonstrate that Ssa proteins indeed can interact with the FG-repeat region of Nup116p by the conventional pull-down assay with GST fusions while no positive data were obtained with Nup100p and Nsp1p in addition to the control, GST alone. We could not confirm Ssa2-dependent interaction between Nup116p and tRNAs by the pull-down assay, probably from rather high off-rate of tRNAs from Ssa proteins. However, a variant of the low affinity binding assay developed by Rexach's group [<a href=\"#bib53\">Patel et al. (2007)</a> Cell, 129, 83-96] allowed us to demonstrate that Ssa proteins can mediate interaction between Nup116p and tRNAs in vitro (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). We now postulate that Ssa proteins may interact with the NPC through specific interaction with certain Nups, such as Nup116p. Indeed, several reports indicate that even importin \u03b2 has different affinities to different Nups [Ben-Efraim and Gerace (2001), J Cell Biol, 152, 411-417: Phytila and Rexach (2003) J Biol Chem, 278, 42699-42709].
