We combined tissue clearing, 3D-immunofluorescence, and electron tomography (ET) to longitudinally assess early HIV-1 spread in lymphoid tissues in humanized mice. Immunofluorescence revealed peak infection density in gut at 10\u201312 days post-infection when blood viral loads were low. Human CD4+ T-cells and HIV-1\u2013infected cells localized predominantly to crypts and the lower third of intestinal villi. Free virions and infected cells were not readily detectable by ET at 5-days post-infection, whereas HIV-1\u2013infected cells surrounded by pools of free virions were present in ~10% of intestinal crypts by 10\u201312 days. ET of spleen revealed thousands of virions released by individual cells and discreet cytoplasmic densities near sites of prolific virus production. These studies highlight the importance of multiscale imaging of HIV-1\u2013infected tissues and are adaptable to other animal models and human patient samples."

We combined tissue clearing, 3D-immunofluorescence, and electron tomography (ET) to longitudinally assess early HIV-1 spread in lymphoid tissues in humanized mice. Immunofluorescence revealed peak infection density in gut at 10\u201312 days post-infection when blood viral loads were low. Human CD4+ T-cells and HIV-1\u2013infected cells localized predominantly to crypts and the lower third of intestinal villi. Free virions and infected cells were not readily detectable by ET at 5-days post-infection, whereas HIV-1\u2013infected cells surrounded by pools of free virions were present in ~10% of intestinal crypts by 10\u201312 days. ET of spleen revealed thousands of virions released by individual cells and discreet cytoplasmic densities near sites of prolific virus production. These studies highlight the importance of multiscale imaging of HIV-1\u2013infected tissues and are adaptable to other animal models and human patient samples."

The majority of new HIV-1 infections result from heterosexual transmission, with women accounting for a majority of all new infections worldwide (<a href=\"#bib67\">UNAIDS, 2015</a>). During heterosexual transmission of HIV-1, the virus crosses the genital epithelium and infects a target cell, which results in localized infection, establishment of a latently-infected virus reservoir, expansion of a local founder population, and systemic virus spread to distant tissues via lymph and blood (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fackler et al., 2014</a>). With blood containing only 1\u20132% of HIV-1 target cells in the body, the majority of HIV-1 target cells in the human body reside within tissues (<a href=\"#bib24\">Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kilby, 2001</a>). Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), lymph nodes, and spleen contain a large number HIV-1 target cells that support localized virus transmission and remain a key source of virus replication during systemic spread and long term disease progression (<a href=\"#bib25\">Haase, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Reinhart et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Grossman et al., 1998</a>), yet the biological details of interactions between the virus and immune cells within tissues remain poorly characterized at single cell and subcellular resolution."

However, recent advances in optical clearing of intact tissues combined with 3D fluorescence microscopy enable imaging of tissues at single cell resolution (<a href=\"#bib54\">Richardson et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tainaka et al., 2016</a>). The basic principles of tissue clearing involve removing opaque biomolecules that reduce light penetration into samples and matching the refractive index of optics, solutions, and tissues to minimize optical distortions during imaging. CLARITY/PACT and CUBIC tissue-clearing techniques were recently applied to render entire rodents optically clear while maintaining tissue integrity at the single cell level (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chung et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Susaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tainaka et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Treweek et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). When combined with IF and fluorescence microscopy, these techniques allow imaging of large volumes (mm<sup>3</sup>\u2013cm<sup>3</sup>) of intact tissues at single cell resolution, delineation of the connectivity of biological structures, and discrimination of individual cell types within complex tissue environments. Tissue clearing techniques were recently applied to image brain, nervous system, and internal organs in rodents, the spatial heterogeneity of mouse tumor models, developmental processes in zebrafish, and post-mortem pathology from preserved human samples (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tainaka et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chung et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Susaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tainaka et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tomer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Guldner et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Tomer et al., 2015</a>), but have not previously been used to image lymphoid tissues from HIV-1\u2013infected animals."

ET can provide 3D information at subcellular resolution from frozen hydrated or from well-preserved, fixed biological samples (<a href=\"#bib43\">McIntosh et al., 2005</a>). ET of purified HIV-1 and HIV-1\u2013infected cultured cells have contributed to our understanding of the HIV-1 life-cycle through investigations of the structures of mature and immature virions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Benjamin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Briggs et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wright et al., 2007</a>), envelope spike densities and conformations on virions (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zhu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2008</a>), virus biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carlson et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2008</a>), cell entry, and cell-to-cell transmission (<a href=\"#bib18\">Earl et al., 2013</a>). Although informative, these studies provided no information concerning HIV-1 in the context of an infection within a host organism. The in situ environment involves multiple cell types within tissues and organs, which may alter virus behavior and fine-structural associations compared to infection within a cultured cell environment. In a previous study, we combined optimized tissue preservation methods with ET to image HIV-1 in GALT derived from chronically infected hu-mice (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ladinsky et al., 2014</a>). This approach allowed us to distinguish and characterize mature, immature, and budding virions, localize infected cells and intercellular pools of free virions within colon crypts, and identify distinct components of virus budding machinery within infected GALT tissues (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ladinsky et al., 2014</a>). These studies shed light on HIV-1 interactions during later phases of infection, establishing the groundwork for investigations of HIV-1 during critical early virus spread in lymphoid tissues."

This parallel approach allowed us to image systemic virus spread in HIV-1\u2013infected hu-mouse lymphoid tissues at different volumes, resolutions, and times after infection. These analyses provided a longitudinal and spatial comparison of the location, type, and density of infected cells, routes of virus spread, and virus levels in lymphoid tissues. Infectivity in GALT and spleen preceded peak blood viremia and showed a rapid and exponential spread of virus in these tissues early after infection. Blood viral load peaked over a week later, when infectivity in several lymphoid tissues was beginning to diminish, emphasizing the discrepancy between blood and tissue infectivity. During times of peak infectivity, large numbers of free virions were identified in spleen, with individual infected cells being surrounded by\u00a0&gt;1000 virions within thin volumes of tissue. These studies provide multiscale information about the early systemic spread of virus within lymphoid tissues at both cellular and subcellular resolution, and these methods are readily adaptable to in situ analysis of HIV-1\u2013infection in other hu-mouse and NHP models, and samples from human patients."

                                "text": "Perhaps the most accurate hu-mouse model, bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) mice, are generated by transferring CD34+ human stem cells together with human fetal thymic and liver tissues during individual surgeries into immunocompromised mice (<a href=\"#bib46\">Melkus et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lan et al., 2006</a>). While BLT mice are optimal for studies of mucosal transmission of HIV-1 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sun et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Denton et al., 2008</a>), they are not cost effective for longitudinal studies of HIV-1 infection involving large cohorts of infected animals. We therefore used a technically simpler and less expensive hu-mouse model constructed by injection of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells/lymphocytes (PBMC/PBL) into NOD.Cg-<i>Prkd</i><sup>scid</sup><i>Il2rg</i><sup>tm1Wjl</sup>/SzJ (NSG) mice (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ishikawa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shultz et al., 2005</a>; ; <a href=\"#bib32\">King et al., 2008</a>), which are immunocompromised animals lacking mature natural killer cells, B-cells and T-cells. PBMC-NSG mice rapidly reconstitute human CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in addition to human B-cells and disseminate human lymphoid cells to lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, genital mucosa, and intestine (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hatziioannou and Evans, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Marsden and Zack, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ishikawa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">King et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Mosier et al., 1988</a>). It is important to note that the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model almost exclusively harbors activated human T cells that can react with host antigens and cause animals to develop graph versus host disease (<a href=\"#bib39\">Marsden and Zack, 2015</a>). The lack of other cell lineages combined with raised levels of T cell activation in this model may enhance the dynamics of HIV spread and pathogenesis compared to other hu-mouse models that contain a smaller compartment of activated T cells at the time of infection and a more diverse set of immune cell lineages. Nonetheless, the robust reconstitution of activated human T-cells in the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse models is an important component for HIV-1 studies in hu-mice since (i) CD4+ T-cells make up the majority of all HIV-1 target cells in humans (<a href=\"#bib25\">Haase, 1999</a>), (ii) activated T cells constitute a sizeable proportion of all CD4+ T cells in humans (~10%), (iii) activated T cells rise to\u00a0~20\u201340% during the course of HIV-1 infection (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mahalingam et al., 1993</a>), and (iv) activated T cells localize to important tissue sites of virus pathology including spleen, lymph nodes, and GALT (<a href=\"#bib55\">Saksena et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cerf-Bensussan and Guy-Grand, 1991</a>). Importantly, HIV-1 infection of PBMC-NSG mice mimics early stages of infection in humans, in that the virus replicates exponentially, resulting in large scale CD4+ T-cell depletion within a few weeks (<a href=\"#bib39\">Marsden and Zack, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kumar et al., 2008</a>), and this model was previously used to study the effectiveness of anti-HIV-1 therapies in reducing systemic virus spread after intravenous transmission (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kumar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Balazs et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hur et al., 2012</a>). The lower cost, simplicity, rapid generation of HIV-1\u2013infected animal cohorts, and effective reconstitution of systemic virus spread make the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model advantageous for longitudinal studies investigating early T cell-mediated pathogenic events in GALT, spleen, and peripheral blood."

To compare with our previous imaging studies of GALT from long-term (10 to 20 weeks PI) infected BLT mice (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ladinsky et al., 2014</a>), we chose three weeks PI for analysis and imaging in PBMC-NSG mice to ensure that human cells and virus would still be present in tissues. Female NSG mice were reconstituted with human PBMCs and three PBMC-NSG mice were infected with R5-tropic HIV-1 (pNL4-3envYU2). HIV-1 p24 levels in blood showed mean levels of 2.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.78 ng/mL at 12 days PI and 12.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.05 ng/mL at 21 days PI, demonstrating productive infection in all three animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). An\u00a0infected animal was necropsied at 21 days PI and adjacent GALT samples from the colon were fixed with aldehydes for parallel IF and ET analysis. IF of colon showed the presence of human CD3+ cells and HIV-1 p24 in infected animals three weeks PI in colon crypts and within the crypt epithelium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). ET corroborated the IF results, showing the presence of infected cells indicated by virus budding profiles projecting from the plasma membrane and free virions in similar tissue locations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). The localization and levels of T-cells and HIV-1 within colon crypts were consistent with our previous studies in HIV-1\u2013infected BLT animals (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ladinsky et al., 2014</a>), establishing the validity of the PBMC-NSG model for conducting longitudinal imaging studies of HIV-1 infection and spread in lymphoid tissues."

Cleared colon samples from HIV-1\u2013infected or mock-infected controls were immunostained and imaged (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Representative images revealed low levels of infected human CD3+ T-cells at 5 days PI, which rapidly increased to peak levels at 10\u201316 days PI, before diminishing at time points\u00a0&gt;21 days PI. To enable quantification of T-cell and infection densities, the total number of nuclei in confocal slices were determined using the Fiji software suite (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a>), resulting in an agreement of 96.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9% compared to manual quantification (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Human CD3+ T-cells from at least four confocal slices in 1\u20133 animals at individual time points were manually quantified in infected and uninfected controls (n\u00a0&gt;\u00a05000 cells per time point). T-cells in colon from uninfected PBMC-NSG mice remained near 6% of total cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), comparable to the\u00a0~10\u201312% found in uninfected human patient samples (<a href=\"#bib42\">McElrath et al., 2013</a>). Human CD3+ T-cell densities in HIV-1\u2013infected animals were similar to densities in uninfected controls until 12 days PI, at which time T-cell levels rapidly dropped to\u00a0&lt;4% of total cells at 16 days PI and continued to decrease gradually out to 45 days PI. p24+/human CD3+ T-cells were quantified similarly in GALT, revealing peak infectivity at 12 days PI, with nearly 3% of cells representing HIV-1\u2013infected T-cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Infectivity levels rapidly decreased to\u00a0&lt;1% of cells representing infected T-cells after 21 days PI and approached zero by 35 days PI. When compared to p24 levels in blood from the same animals, the percent of p24+ T-cells peaked at 12 days PI and preceded peak blood p24 levels by 9 days, when p24 levels were low (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). At peak blood p24 levels (21 days PI), the percentage of p24+ T-cells in colon had already diminished to nearly half of maximum levels at 10\u201312 days PI. These results are consistent with a disconnect between tissue infectivity and blood viral load over time, as previously noted in human samples (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anton et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chun et al., 1997</a>). p24 not co-localized with human CD3+ T-cells was compared to levels of p24 associated with human CD3+ T-cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,E</a>). This analysis revealed an increase in p24 signal not associated with human CD3+ T-cells concomitant with decreased infectivity of human CD3+ T-cells at 21 days PI."

A 45 \u03bcm confocal Z-stack from the colon of an HIV-1\u2013infected hu-mouse at 12 days PI displayed human CD4+ T-cells and p24+ cells localized to intestinal crypts and the bottom half of villi, whereas human CD8+ T-cells were dispersed uniformly throughout the crypts and the length of the villi (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

Tissue samples adjacent to those used for IF were imaged in parallel by ET, as opposed to directly imaging the same tissue sample using both IF and EM, because the methods for extracting lipids from cleared tissues for IF eliminates scaffolding within the cell, resulting in destruction of ultrastructural details at the EM level (<a href=\"#bib65\">Treweek et al., 2015</a>). EM surveys of colon crypts, where we previously characterized active HIV-1 infection by ET in a BLT hu-mouse model (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ladinsky et al., 2014</a>), confirmed the infectious profile depicted by IF (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). Early after infection (5 days PI), infected cells and free virus were not readily detected. This was followed by an exponential increase in the number of infected cells and the presence of large extracellular pools of free virus, often containing\u00a0&gt;100 free virions within 200\u2013400 nm thick regions of tissue during peak infectivity (10\u201316 days PI). At this time,\u00a0~10% of crypts showed signs of active infection cells as evidenced by cells with budding virions attached to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; center panel). At later times (&gt;21 days PI), the total number of infected cells was reduced and individual pools of free virus in similar locations contained fewer virions. Most of the pools of free virus were not associated with actively-infected cells, consistent with our IF observation that levels of HIV-1 p24 not associated with human CD3+ T-cells increased at later time points PI (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and E</a>). These results suggested that most of the p24+/CD3- cells detected by IF at late times PI represented pools of free-virions, rather than infected cells other than T cells."

Red pulp makes up a majority of the volume of the spleen, contains large numbers of red blood cells (RBCs) generating a red hue, and primarily functions to filter the blood. White pulp contains large numbers of B- and T-cells that coordinate immune responses within the blood. As such, spleen harbors large quantities of HIV-1 target cells, making it an important organ for HIV-1 pathology (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mebius and Kraal, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ganusov and De Boer, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Langeveld et al., 2006</a>).

Brightfield microscopy images of uninfected PBMC-NSG animals revealed regions of white pulp at greater levels than non-reconstituted NSG animals, but these were not organized into foci as in wildtype spleen. IF of uninfected PBMC-NSG spleen showed localized pockets of human CD3+ T-cells interspersed throughout volumes of splenic tissue (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6A</a>; left panels). Montaged projection EM surveys of uninfected PBMC-NSG spleen demonstrated delineations between white pulp and red pulp regions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; left panels and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Red pulp contained enucleated RBCs, while white pulp was distinguished by an absence of RBCs, bundles of collagen fibrils, and populations of lymphocytes identified as cells with large, dense nuclei surrounded by minimal cytoplasm. Overall, the organization of the spleen in PBMC-NSG hu-mice was intermediary between non-reconstituted NSG animals and wildtype immunocompetent animals, with white pulp occurring as smaller striations within the red pulp as opposed to the circular foci seen in spleens from wildtype animals (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results demonstrated that structural and cellular components of splenic white pulp, most importantly HIV-1 target cells, are present in PBMC-NSG animals even though the splenic architecture is altered."

Tissue clearing and 3D-IF allowed the quantification of human T-cells and HIV-1\u2013infected cells within intact GALT from PBMC-NSG hu-mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and revealed a human CD3+ T-cell density that was comparable to those from human patient colon samples (<a href=\"#bib42\">McElrath et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, human T-cells were found in intestinal crypts, in agreement with results from HIV-1\u2013infected colon samples from BLT hu-mice (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ladinsky et al., 2014</a>), colon samples from SIV-infected NHP (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mohan et al., 2007</a>), and uninfected human colon samples (<a href=\"#bib42\">McElrath et al., 2013</a>), validating the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model for studying HIV-1 infection of human T-cells in GALT. Longitudinal quantification of infectivity in GALT revealed the dynamics of HIV-1 infectivity over time. Peak infectivity in GALT occurred while levels of virus in the blood, a hallmark of HIV-1 progression, were quite low. GALT infectivity then rapidly decreased and coincided with a drop in human CD3+ T-cell density in HIV-1\u2013infected animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), consistent with studies in humans showing T-cell depletion in GALT during acute HIV-1 infection (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brenchley et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mehandru et al., 2004</a>). In our previous ET study of HIV-1-infection in GALT from BLT animals, all samples were from 10\u201320 weeks PI, yet HIV-1 and infected T cells were present (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ladinsky et al., 2014</a>). The more rapid dynamics of virus spread and target cell depletion in GALT of HIV-1\u2013infected PBMC-NSG hu-mice could be due to the high levels of T cell activation and a lack of T cell replenishment in PBMC-NSG animals (<a href=\"#bib39\">Marsden and Zack, 2015</a>)."

Accordingly, HIV-1\u2013infected human CD4+ T-cells also localized to the bottom third of villi and in crypt regions, with most infected cells residing in crypts. This spatial distribution remained\u00a0consistent, even as human CD4+\u00a0andCD8+ T-cell levels changed during the course of infection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>).

The highest levels of free virus in both GALT and spleen occurred at 10\u201312 days PI, a time when virus levels in the blood were low (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We detected pools of free virus contiguous with mucosal vasculature in GALT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), and in spleen, a tissue that acts to filter the blood, we visualized\u00a0&gt;1000 virions being produced from one region of an HIV-1\u2013infected cell (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We calculated that a single infected cell within tissue could produce\u00a0&gt;6000 virions during a round of virus release, providing insights into the exponential production of HIV-1 within tissues early after infection. The total number of SIV virions produced by an\u00a0individual infected cell was previously estimated to be 4.0\u20135.4 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). If a similar number of HIV-1 virions are produced from infected cells within tissue, this implies multiple rounds of virus release from each infected cell, as suggested by our previous ET studies (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ladinsky et al., 2014</a>). In lymphoid\u00a0tissues, the large numbers of target cells combined with high levels of virus production and accessibility to vasculature suggest that HIV-1\u2013infected cells in tissue provide a source of free virus that contributes to blood viral load and systemic spread."

Here we showed immuno-EM localization of anti-VPS4A antibodies to equivalent regions of budding virions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

Although we could not conclusively identify these densities as containing VPS4, they differed in size, intensity and shape from ribosomes, which are also distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">9</a>). Notably, the large accumulations of cytoplasmic densities were only present in cells undergoing prolific budding (&gt;100 buds), suggesting they are directly involved in HIV-1 assembly and/or budding.

ET of adjacent regions of tissue allowed the detection of individual virions, infected cells, and subcellular protein complexes within the context of actively-infected tissues at specific times PI.

The authors do not delve deeply enough into using their imagining techniques to add new knowledge to the field of HIV mucosal transmission and pathogenesis. Using these techniques to compare routes of infection (intravaginal vs. intrarectal vs. intravenous) could be highly informative, as well as testing how various viral isolates, perhaps those with different chemokine receptor tropisms, may disseminate differently throughout the GALT. Even within the data currently presented, additional follow-up could be conducted to fully interrogate the results, such as the imaging of p24+ cells that were interestingly not co-localized with CD3+ T cells. The characterization of these infected cell types or determining whether these images represent cell-free virus warrants significant follow-up experiments."

Though it has been shown that CD4+ T cells are indeed rapidly depleted from gut tissues during acute HIV infection, the depletion seen here is quite rapid and extensive (virtually permanent) and may be an important caveat of the model. In contrast to natural infection, here new T cells are not being generated from human-derived hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, as would be the case in the BLT or Hu-HSC humanized mouse models. This important caveat needs to be discussed in more detail to give an accurate interpretation of the results, particularly with respect to the time course data."

Our choice of PBMC-NSG mice as the humanized mouse model for our studies was influenced by previous research done at Caltech in David Baltimore\u2019s laboratory. Because my laboratory learned how to make and infect hu-mice from the Baltimore lab, we used their mouse model for our studies: specifically, we used the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model described in the Baltimore laboratory paper demonstrating that AAV delivery of anti-HIV antibodies is protective against HIV infection [1]. In this paper, Balazs et al. showed data demonstrating that the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model exhibits CD4 T cell depletion upon challenge with HIV, and they noted that this had also been shown by others [2]; thus, we were confident that this mouse model could be used to reproduce the T cell-mediated systemic spread and subsequent T cell depletion that occurs in natural HIV infections. The Baltimore laboratory also used the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model for some of the experiments described in their other papers [3,4]. In addition, a recent paper characterizing and describing the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model demonstrated T cell depletion, high virus p24 levels in blood, and the effectiveness of both HAART and passive antibody transfer upon HIV infection in this mouse model, concluding that the model is a relevant infection and pathogenesis model [5]."

To directly address the concerns of the reviewers, we point out that nearly all of the CD3+ T cells in the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model are activated as compared to ~10% in healthy human patients [6]. The revised manuscript now notes the higher levels of activated T cells in PBMC-NSG mouse model compared with humans could alter the dynamics of HIV spread as compared to other hu-mouse models or human patients with lower levels of activated T cells and a more diverse set of immune cell lineages. However, because (i) activated T cells make up ~10% of the total T cell population in humans, (ii) T cell activation increases to 20-40% during the course of HIV infection [6], and (iii) T cells represent the largest population of HIV target cells in the body [7], our demonstration by ET that individual activated T cells can produce thousands of free virions provides a striking observation that is relevant for understanding the routes and modes of HIV-1 spread in lymphoid tissues."

However, we have done direct comparisons of HIV-infected GALT from the PBMC-NSG mice used for the current studies and from the Ragon Institute BLT mice. We found that the localization and density of human T cells were equivalent in GALT from the two hu-mouse models (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 1</a>). In addition, free virions were found at similar levels and locations in GALT from both mouse models (<a href=\"#fig11\">Author response image 2</a>). The observation that T cell levels in GALT were comparable between BLT and PBMC-NSG mice suggests that our results in PBMC-NSG mice represent a valid model to look at T cell-mediated spread of HIV. In addition, although we acknowledge that PBMC-NSG mice are reconstituted mainly with activated T cells, we again note that T cells make up a majority of all HIV target cells in humans [7] and T cell activation increases to 20-40% during the course of HIV infection [6]. Thus, the PBMC-NSG model represents a relevant model to study the spread of virus caused by activated T cells within lymphoid tissues."

Thus, we cannot directly image the exact same tissue sample by both IF and ET. By parallel imaging, we mean imaging of pieces of adjacent tissues by IF and for EM, as clarified in the revised text in the first paragraph of the \"ET of longitudinal HIV-1 spread in GALT\" portion of the Results section."

The authors do not delve deeply enough into using their imagining techniques to add new knowledge to the field of HIV mucosal transmission and pathogenesis. Using these techniques to compare routes of infection (intravaginal vs. intrarectal vs. intravenous) could be highly informative, as well as testing how various viral isolates, perhaps those with different chemokine receptor tropisms, may disseminate differently throughout the GALT.</i>"

For this reason, the Baltimore laboratory at Caltech used BLT mice for the majority of their studies of vaginally-infected hu-mice [3]. Because Caltech does not have a facility to produce BLT mice, the Baltimore laboratory obtained the mice from a collaborator, Dong Sung An, at UCLA. We have recently begun a collaboration with Dr. An to obtain longitudinal BLT tissue samples from mice infected by different routes with either CCR5- versus CXCR4-tropic HIV strains. We are also collaborating with other laboratories to obtain SIV- and SHIV-infected NHP tissue for imaging. However, these are on-going studies that will take at least a year to complete, so we cannot include them in the present manuscript."

Though it has been shown that CD4+ T cells are indeed rapidly depleted from gut tissues during acute HIV infection, the depletion seen here is quite rapid and extensive (virtually permanent) and may be an important caveat of the model. In contrast to natural infection, here new T cells are not being generated from human-derived hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, as would be the case in the BLT or Hu-HSC humanized mouse models. This important caveat needs to be discussed in more detail to give an accurate interpretation of the results, particularly with respect to the time course data.</i>"
