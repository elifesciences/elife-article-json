We found that layer2 is composed of two principal cell populations (calbindin-positive and calbindin-negative neurons) which targeted the contralateral PreS and retrosplenial cortex, respectively. Layer3 pyramidal neurons projected to the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). By juxtacellularly recording PreS neurons in awake rats during passive-rotation, we found that head-direction responses were preferentially contributed by layer3 pyramidal cells, whose long-range axons branched within layer3 of the MEC. In contrast, layer2 neurons displayed distinct spike-shapes, were not modulated by head-direction but rhythmically-entrained by theta-oscillations. Fast-spiking interneurons showed only weak directionality and theta-rhythmicity, but were significantly modulated by angular velocity. Our data thus indicate that PreS neurons differentially contribute to head-direction coding, and point to a cell-type- and layer-specific routing of directional and non-directional information to downstream cortical targets."

Together with place cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">O'keefe and Nadel, 1978</a>), grid cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>) and border cells (<a href=\"#bib53\">Savelli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Solstad et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lever et al., 2009</a>), HD cells are thought to be part of an internal representation of self-location in the mammalian brain, and hence support spatial navigation and cognition (<a href=\"#bib76\">Valerio and Taube, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gibson et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "The discovery of HD cells was followed by many years of investigation, aimed at elucidating the subcortical and cortical networks involved in the generation and processing of HD information (<a href=\"#bib73\">Taube, 2007</a>; see <a href=\"#bib85\">Yoder and Taube, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Geva-Sagiv et al., 2015</a> for review). According to current views, HD signals are generated subcortically and relayed to parahippocampal cortices via dorsal thalamic nuclei (<a href=\"#bib72\">Taube, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Goodridge and Taube, 1997</a>). The PreS receives a major projection from dorsal thalamic nuclei (<a href=\"#bib58\">Shipley and Sorensen, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Thompson and Robertson, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shibata, 1993</a>), contains the highest proportion of sharp HD cells among parahippocampal cortices (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Winter et al., 2015a</a>) and contributes a major projection to the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Caballero\u2010Bleda and Witter, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Honda and Ishizuka, 2004</a>). Thus, the PreS represents a major gateway of HD information into the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit. Notably, HD inputs to MEC where most grid cells have been observed (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sargolini et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>) have recently received great attention following experimental evidence pointing to HD signals as critical contributors to grid cell firing - in line with predictions from path-integration models (<a href=\"#bib11\">Burak and Fiete, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">McNaughton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bush and Burgess, 2014</a>). HD inputs to entorhinal grid cells could be \u2018un-masked\u2019 by removing excitatory feedback from the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bonnevie et al., 2013</a>), and grid cell firing was disrupted following inactivation of HD signals (<a href=\"#bib82\">Winter et al., 2015a</a>). Thus, theoretical and experimental evidence provide support for a \u2018HD-to-grid\u2019 transformation, and thus point to HD signals as critical components of the \u2018cognitive\u2019 grid-representation of space. However, despite this progress at the computational and systems level, direct anatomical evidence has been lacking. Specifically, while a previous study has indicated that HD inputs reach the MEC (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tukker et al., 2015</a>), it is currently unknown how these projections are anatomically organized, and whether the morphological/electrophysiological diversity of PreS neurons (<a href=\"#bib24\">Funahashi and Stewart, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Simonnet et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abbasi and Kumar, 2013</a>) is related to in-vivo function. These represent major limitations for understanding how parahippocampal circuits are functionally organized, and how anatomically-identified circuits support spatial cognitive functions."

The neuronal marker NeuN and calbindin revealed a prominently modular organization of PreS layer 2 (L2; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib20\">Ding and Rockland, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Honda and Ishizuka, 2004</a>) while layer 3 (L3) had a more homogenous appearance (NeuN staining; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In L2, calbindin immunoreactivity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fujise et al., 1995</a>) revealed two distinct principal cell populations - calbindin-positive and calbindin-negative neurons - which represented ~33% and 67% of the total neurons within this layer, respectively (n\u00a0=\u00a0916 calbindin-positive out of 2793 NeuN-positive neurons; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

To this end, we took advantage of a head-fixed preparation (see <a href=\"#bib87\">Zugaro et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shinder and Taube, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">2014</a> for review) and recorded spiking activity from single neurons in awake rats during passive rotation.

Within the same recording, animals were rotated both clockwise and counterclockwise (average number of inversions, 6.6 \u00b1 4.7; n\u00a0=\u00a0310 recordings) and average accelerations (1.3 \u00b1 0.8\u2009rad/s<sup>2</sup>), decelerations (\u22121.1 \u00b1 0.7\u2009rad/s<sup>2</sup>) and angular velocities (1.1 \u00b1 0.4\u2009rad/s) were within the physiological ranges reported by previous studies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blair and Sharp, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Taube, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stackman and Taube, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shinder and Taube, 2011</a>).

                                "text": "In line with previous studies using similar head-restraining procedures, as well as freely moving animals (<a href=\"#bib70\">Taube et al., 1990a</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Taube, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tukker et al., 2015</a>), sharp HD-selective responses were very common among PreS neurons and could be reliably assessed by on-line monitoring of spiking activity (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). To quantify head-directionality of spiking responses, we computed the HD index (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>), while statistical significance was assessed with a shuffling test (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tukker et al., 2015</a>). Neurons were defined as HD cells if the HD index was larger than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the shuffled distribution (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). A large proportion of PreS neurons met these criteria (186 out of 310; ~60%; see also <a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tukker et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), with the fraction \u2018strong\u2019 HD cells (HD index &gt;0.8 and p&lt;0.01; 121/310, ~39%) being within the range of previous studies from freely-behaving rodents (<a href=\"#bib70\">Taube et al., 1990a</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">1990b</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tukker et al., 2015</a>). A minority of weak but statistically-significant HD responses were contributed by fast-spiking (FS) interneurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; see below). Firing in HD cells was stable over time, as assessed by Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient of HD tuning curves computed for the two halves of each recording session (mean correlation coefficient, 0.79 \u00b1 0.21; n\u00a0=\u00a0181 HD cells) and preferred firing directions were homogeneously distributed over a 360 degrees angle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Taube et al., 1990a</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Taube, 1995</a>). During passive rotation, average and peak firing rates of HD cells (3.4 \u00b1 4.2\u2009Hz and 15.4 \u00b1 12.6\u2009Hz, respectively; n\u00a0=\u00a0186) were also within the range reported during free behavior (<a href=\"#bib70\">Taube et al., 1990a</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">1990b</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blair and Sharp, 1996</a>). Thus, in line with previous work, the basic properties (e.g. distribution of preferred firing directions, HD strength, stability, average and peak firing rates) and abundance of PreS HD cells recorded under passive rotation appeared to be very similar to the ones recorded in freely-moving animals. To further confirm that bona fide HD cells can be recorded under passive rotation, in a subset of recordings (n\u00a0=\u00a04) we sequentially monitored the activity of the same HD cells during head-fixation and free-behavior. To achieve this, we used miniaturized recording equipment (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tang et al., 2014</a>), which allowed us to release the rats from head-fixation while maintaining the juxtacellular recording during free movement. As shown in the representative recording in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, the general tuning properties of the HD cells were very similar between passive-rotation and free behavior (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; mean correlation coefficient of the HD tuning curves, 0.68 \u00b1 0.20, p&lt;0.05; n\u00a0=\u00a04)."

To further investigate this issue, we sought to target juxtacellular recordings to L2. Since this layer is a relatively thin cortical structure - which makes \u2018blind\u2019 juxtacellular targeting particularly challenging- we first explored whether there are electrophysiological signatures of PreS L2, which could enable its selective targeting by juxtacellular procedures. To this end, we employed extracellular recording techniques and monitored multi-unit spiking and local field potential (LFP) activity during electrode penetrations orthogonal to the PreS layers. We found that in awake animals (and to some extent also in anesthetized animals; not shown) L2 could be reliably localized based on two extracellular signatures; first, we often observed an increase in multi-unit spiking activity upon entry into L2, which could possibly result from the relatively higher cellular density within this layer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Second, the transition from L2 to L1 could always be reliably identified, due to the sharp cessation of spiking activity occurring upon entry into L1. Indeed in 4 out of 4 experiments, where electrode locations were confirmed relative to electrolytic lesions (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), we could reliably identify the location of PreS L2 (not shown), indicating that these electrophysiological signatures could be used to successfully target PreS L2."

While HD cells were commonly found before the cortical depth of L2 -assessed by prior extracellular mapping- neurons sampled within L2 discharged independently from the direction the rat was facing during passive rotation. These observations were confirmed by juxtacellular labeling, as shown in two representative recordings from identified L2 neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The basal dendrites of the first neuron, which was calbindin-positive (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), were largely confined within L2, while the apical dendritic branches covered a large territory within L1. This neuron fired irrespectively of the direction the animal was facing during passive rotation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>; p=0.35). The second neuron also displayed basal dendrites largely confined to L2, a multipolar apical dendritic tree extending into L1, and was calbindin-negative (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This neuron was also not tuned to HD (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>; p=0.67). In both neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D</a>) an axon could be traced within the angular bundle: these axons however followed a different route compared to L3 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), as they travelled medially (rather than laterally) within the angular bundle - possibly towards contralateral projection targets, in line with tracing experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>)."

Both the strength of HD modulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and the proportion of HD cells were significantly lower in L2 compared to L3 (0/11 in L2 versus 18/25 in L3, p&lt;0.001, Fisher\u2019s Exact Test). Notably, while average firing rates did not differ (L2, 2.5 \u00b1 2.5\u2009Hz; L3, 2.4 \u00b1 2.6\u2009Hz; p=0.245), spiking rhythmicity in the theta-frequency range (4\u201312\u2009Hz) as assessed by a standard \u2018theta index\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib84\">Yartsev et al., 2011</a>) was more prominent among L2 than L3 neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>; we note that in our head-fixed preparation, theta activity presumably reflects immobility-related type-II theta [<a href=\"#bib55\">Shin, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">Tai et al., 2012</a>] since animals were not actively moving during passive rotation). In line with previous work from freely-moving animals (<a href=\"#bib70\">Taube et al., 1990a</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tukker et al., 2015</a>), theta-rhythmicity was very sparse among principal neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), and the only statistically-significant theta-rhythmic discharges (as assessed by a shuffling procedure; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) were selectively contributed by L2 cells (4 out of 4). Theta-rhythmic spiking patterns were contributed by both calbindin-positive and calbindin-negative neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), and average theta-indices did not differ significantly between the two cell classes (calbindin-positive, 2.3 \u00b1 2.3, n\u00a0=\u00a03; calbindin-negative, 3.8 \u00b1 2.5, n\u00a0=\u00a06; p=0.54; we note however that the small dataset of identified calbindin-positive neurons prevents rigorous assessment of structure-function relationships). The electrophysiological differences between L2 and L3 neurons were not accounted for by biases in rotational parameters, since average angular velocities (L2, 0.96 \u00b1 0.31\u2009rad/s; L3, 0.96 \u00b1 0.33\u2009rad/s; p=0.8), accelerations (L2, 1.41 \u00b1 0.82\u2009rad/s<sup>2</sup>; L3, 1.24 \u00b1 0.89\u2009rad/s<sup>2</sup>; p=0.4) and decelerations (L2, \u22121.27 \u00b1 0.74\u2009rad/s<sup>2</sup>; L3, -1.12 \u00b1 0.81\u2009rad/s<sup>2</sup>; p=0.3) were not significantly different between L2 (n\u00a0=\u00a011) and L3 (n\u00a0=\u00a025) recordings. Notably, the spike waveforms of L2 neurons differed significantly from that of L3 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), as they showed on average a significantly longer duration (as assessed by spike half-width) and more pronounced negativity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Altogether, these data indicate that PreS L2 and L3 neurons can be differentiated according to spike waveform features, HD modulation and temporal spiking properties within the theta-frequency range (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Here we show that the superficial layers of the rat PreS are composed of molecularly- and morphologically-distinct principal cell populations, which can be differentiated according to long-range projection targets. Temporal and directional firing properties are differentially distributed among these neurons, with L3 pyramidal cells being predominantly modulated by HD, and L2 neurons\u2019 spiking being largely unaffected by HD but significantly entrained by theta oscillations. These findings closely resemble the cytoarchitectonic and functional architecture of the MEC; specifically, also in MEC (i) calbindin-positive neurons are clustered and project (at least to some extent) to the contralateral homologue area (<a href=\"#bib80\">Varga et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fuchs et al., 2016</a>), and (ii) L2 and L3 neurons differ in morphological, electrophysiological, functional properties and projection targets (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kitamura et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ray et al., 2014</a>). Notably, both Pres and MEC have been shown to contain the same types of spatially-modulated neurons, albeit in different proportions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>). The common basic architecture of PreS and MEC circuits could point to similar mechanisms supporting the generation of spatial firing within these areas, as proposed by previous authors (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>)."

Our experiments confirmed earlier work which indicated that HD responses are largely preserved under these conditions (<a href=\"#bib87\">Zugaro et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shinder and Taube, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">2014</a>). Indeed, the abundance and general properties of PreS HD neurons were very similar to the ones reported from freely-moving animals, thus pointing to a largely intact HD system which is uncoupled from voluntary animal locomotion (see also <a href=\"#bib83\">Winter et al., 2015b</a>). Our approach thus enabled efficient identification and labeling of HD neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) but prevented assessment of spatial firing properties. Hence, the spatial firing patterns of the \u2018non-directional\u2019 L2 neurons remain to be established. We note that the lack of directionality in PreS L2 might be due to the lack of HD inputs from the dorsal thalamus, in line with tracing experiments indicating that thalamic inputs largely avoid PreS L2 (<a href=\"#bib79\">van Groen and Wyss, 1990b</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">1995</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib54\">Shibata, 1993</a>). An intriguing possibility is that L2 neurons could contribute the spatial signals which have been previously recorded among PreS units (i.e. grid and border cells; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Winter et al., 2015b</a>). Based on the known correlation between spiking theta-rhythmicity and grid activity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brandon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Koenig et al., 2011</a>) and the fact that under our recording configuration, theta-rhythmic responses were almost exclusively contributed by L2 PreS neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>), we speculate that L2 could be the principal source of grid activity in PreS - as it is the case in MEC (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>). Future approaches involving either juxtacellular labeling (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tang et al., 2014</a>) or genetic targeting in freely-moving animals will be required for testing this hypothesis."

The distribution of axonal length and axonal varicosities (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>) indicated that most synaptic contacts are likely to occur within MEC L3. Although axonal-bouton distribution is typically in large agreement with connectivity inferred by direct methods, it remains to be established whether MEC L3 neurons are indeed the prime recipient of HD inputs (see <a href=\"#bib17\">Canto et al., 2012</a>). An intriguing observation is that the representation of HD appears to be much sparser in MEC L3 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Giocomo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tang et al., 2015</a>) compared to its presynaptic inputs structure (i.e. PreS L3), arguing against a simple feed-forward inheritance of HD coding. It will be crucial to resolve the signal transformation occurring in MEC L3 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tang et al., 2015</a>) for understanding the layer specific contribution of MEC circuits to spatial coding."

Injections in RS29 (n\u00a0=\u00a04) were centered on, but not restricted to, the caudal portion of the RS29, bordering rostrally with the PreS.

Glass electrodes with a tip diameter of ~20\u201340 \u00b5m filled with CTB solution were then lowered into the target region. To avoid diffusion of the tracer during electrode penetration, the tip of the pipette was front-filled with a small amount of Ringer solution.

After the injections, the pipettes were left in place for several minutes and slowly retracted. The craniotomy was closed by application of silicone (Kwik-cast, World Precision Instruments) and animals survived for 3\u20135 days before being euthanized and transcardially perfused. Both hemispheres were cut into 60\u201370 \u00b5m thick parasagittal slices and analyzed with epifluorescence and/or confocal microscopy.

For these experiments, animals were pre-implanted with a metal post and a recording chamber under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. After a recovery period (~3\u20134 days) animals were slowly habituated to head-fixation and to the rotation of the apparatus. Habituation and recordings were performed under slightly-dimmed ambient illumination in the \u2018cue-rich\u2019 environment of the laboratory setting. Thus, both during habituation and recordings, the rats had visual access to proximal cues available in the immediate vicinity (e.g. computer screens, cold-light source, stereomicroscope) and distal cues (i.e. Faraday cage, ceiling, curtains), including the experimenter, which was always located in the same relative position during the passive rotation experiment. These cues were thus the most likely source of \u2018anchoring\u2019 stability to HD firing (see e.g. <a href=\"#bib39\">Knierim et al., 1995</a> for review).

After cell labeling, animals were either immediately perfused for anatomical analysis, or returned to their home cage and perfused ~4\u201312\u2009hr following labeling. In order to maximize axonal recovery, in some experiments multiple neurons were labeled; the sparse labeling typically allowed unequivocal assignment of the identified cells, based on positional coordinates and recording depth. In total, 54 neurons (48 principal cells and 6 interneurons) were labeled and recovered in PreS. In 36 out of 48 cases, the morphology of principal neurons could be assessed; in the remaining cases, morphology could not be assessed as only the soma and/or proximal dendrites were recovered. Cells were classified as \u2018pyramidal\u2019 if a pyramidal-shaped soma and at least a prominent apical dendrite could be identified. Non-pyramidal, \u2018multipolar\u2019 morphologies were classified based on the proximal dendritic arrangement and the lack of prominent apical dendrite(s). Within L2, principal cells generally displayed \u2018pyramidal-like\u2019 morphologies, with often multiple apical dendrites branching extensively within L1. Ten out of 11 L2 neurons were tested for calbindin expression (3 calbindin-positive and 7 calbindin-negative neurons).

The quality in axonal filling differed among the individual cases, and in general it cannot be assured whether even in the best-filled examples, thin axonal branches were missed due to incomplete filling.

For recordings in which each HD bin was sampled in each half of the recording (n\u00a0=\u00a0181 out of 186 HD cells), we quantified the stability of the HD tuning by generating separate tuning curves for the first and second half of the recording time and calculating Pearson\u2019s linear correlation coefficient."

Unveiling their dynamics and circuitry is vital to further our understanding of how the cognitive map forms within the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and the hippocampus. In the present manuscript, Preston-Ferrer and colleagues present novel findings on the circuit underlying the processing of the HD information in the pre-subiculum (PreS), an important relay of the HD signal to the MEC. Using juxtacellular recordings from awake, head-restrained mice, the authors present data from a large amount of neurons and were able to reconstruct for identified HD cells in vivo their morphology, anatomy and axonal projections. The paper presents three levels of anatomical differentiation within the PreS: i) HD cells were identified within Layer 3, not Layer 2, ii) Layer 3 cells (including HD cells) project to the ipsilateral MEC, Layer 2 neurons project to the contralateral PreS; iii) Layer 2 showed more theta modulation than Layer 3 cells. These results are interesting but the data, in their present form, do not fully support the novel findings."

Indeed, this is surprising and not really expected, as the authors admitted themselves, as (i) HD cells are more prominent in the deep layers of the MEC than in the superficial layers (where they are virtually absent) and (ii) a previous report (Tukker et al., 2015; but only one reconstructed axon was shown there) reported a projection from PreS layer 3 HD cell to the deep layers. Why haven't the author tried an anterograde labeling from the PreS to demonstrate definitively their claim? Do only HD cells from layer 3 project to the MEC or all cells from layer 3? (i.e. did the authors have reconstructed the axons of non-HD cells from PreS layer 3)? Did these 8 HD cells have strong HD index?"

The fact that Layer 2 neurons are theta modulated suggests that they may be modulated by speed, and that will be the demonstration of a nice functional and anatomical segregation between the HD and speed signals. Perhaps the authors should first try to correlate the firing rate with angular speed?"

Such an experimental design has been used before for thalamic recordings, which showed that head-direction cells can be observed under such conditions, but some differences seem to exist to free movement. Because the entire manuscript is based on this preparation, a control experiment for presubicular recordings in the set-up used here should be performed and some neurons should be recorded consecutively during passive rotation and free movement. Of course, this does not require the difficult juxta recording and labelling of the neurons, but could be done with tetrodes or silicon probes, which give more stable recordings and many cells can be recorded simultaneously. This experiment is well within the expertise of the authors and could be done relatively quickly. Importantly, it would give a quantitative measure how the same neurons fire according to head-direction in passive and free movement. This would answer if the same neurons are head-direction cells and how their head-direction tuning changes under both conditions."

Our findings are however not incompatible with existing data since (i) as we pointed out in the discussion, our data do not exclude synapses being made on the apical dendrites of deep-layer neurons (see for example Canto and Witter, J Neurosc 2012) and (ii) grid cells from MEC L2/3 have indeed been shown to receive HD inputs (Bonnevie et al., 2013). These points are referred to in the discussion of the revised manuscript. Second point; we would like to specify that in our previous study (Tukker et al., 2015) a single axon \u2018could be traced till the deep layers of MEC\u2019, but did not terminate there (i.e. no terminal branching or axonal boutons were described). Hence, it is likely the single axon of Tukker et al. was en route towards L3 \u2013 as the present work (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), our new tracing experiments (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>) and previous work indicates (Caballero-Bleda and Witter, 1993, Honda and Ishizuka, 2004). Third point; we have performed the anterograde tracing experiments suggested by the Reviewers (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>). In line with our single axonal reconstructions, the large majority of axons and boutons were indeed observed within MEC L3 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>)."
