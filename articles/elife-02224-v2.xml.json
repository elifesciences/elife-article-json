However, how these two events are integrated to ensure appropriate neural conversion remains unclear. In this study, we showed that Pou3f1 is essential for the neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), specifically during the transition from epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) to neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Chimeric analysis showed that Pou3f1 knockdown leads to a markedly decreased incorporation of ESCs in the neuroectoderm. By contrast, Pou3f1-overexpressing ESC derivatives preferentially contribute to the neuroectoderm. Genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses indicated that Pou3f1 is an upstream activator of neural lineage genes, and also is a repressor of BMP and Wnt signaling. Our results established that Pou3f1 promotes the neural fate commitment of pluripotent stem cells through a dual role, activating internal neural induction programs and antagonizing extrinsic neural inhibitory signals."

However, how these two events are integrated to ensure appropriate neural conversion remains unclear. In this study, we showed that Pou3f1 is essential for the neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), specifically during the transition from epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) to neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Chimeric analysis showed that Pou3f1 knockdown leads to a markedly decreased incorporation of ESCs in the neuroectoderm. By contrast, Pou3f1-overexpressing ESC derivatives preferentially contribute to the neuroectoderm. Genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses indicated that Pou3f1 is an upstream activator of neural lineage genes, and also is a repressor of BMP and Wnt signaling. Our results established that Pou3f1 promotes the neural fate commitment of pluripotent stem cells through a dual role, activating internal neural induction programs and antagonizing extrinsic neural inhibitory signals."

Central to cell allocation is gastrulation, during which the epiblast responds to secreted signals and generates three primary germ layers (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lu et al., 2001</a>). In early mouse embryos, gastrulation initiates at embryonic day (E) 6.5. Posterior epiblast cells ingress through the primitive streak to form the mesoderm and endoderm, whereas the cells that remain in the anterior part of the epiblast form the ectoderm (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tam and Loebel, 2007</a>). Then, a portion of the anterior ectoderm is specified to adopt the neural fate and subsequently, develops into the neuroectoderm, forming a plate-shaped structure called the neural plate at approximately E7.5 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tam and Zhou, 1996</a>)."

In early <i>Xenopus</i>, chick, and mouse embryos, BMP and Wnt signals prevent neural conversion and contribute to non-neural fates such as epidermal differentiation and primitive streak formation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Winnier et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hemmati-Brivanlou and Melton, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wilson et al., 2001</a>).

Zic2 and Otx2 are also involved in epiblast stem cell (EpiSC) neural conversion (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</a>). Recently, Zfp521 was identified as an intrinsic factor that promotes the progression of early neural development (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kamiya et al., 2011</a>). Studies concerning these neural fate-promoting factors have partially revealed the internal mechanism of early neural development. However, how these neural factors are activated during neural fate commitment remains unclear. Moreover, considering the importance of the effect of extrinsic signals on the neural fate decision, it remains unclear whether the inhibition of extrinsic signals and activation of internal factors are regulated separately or are integrated by a single determinant."

Compared with the control, the constitutive expression of Pou3f1 notably enhanced the expression of NPC and the neuron markers during serum-free differentiation, particularly at day 4 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Single cell suspensions from EBs at various days were replated in N2 medium for neuronal differentiation. Many Tuj1<sup>+</sup> neurons emerged from stable Pou3f1-overexpression ESCs at day 4, 2 days earlier than the control ESCs (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>, d). These results demonstrate that neural differentiation was accelerated by Pou3f1 overexpression under serum-free conditions. To exclude the influences of Pou3f1 overexpression on the ESC state, doxycycline (Dox)-inducible Pou3f1-overexpressing ESCs were generated (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). As expected, the Dox-induced overexpression of <i>Pou3f1</i> strongly enhanced ESC neural differentiation in serum-containing medium, which was accompanied by the increased expression of the neural markers Sox1, Pax6, Nestin, and Tuj1 in both quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and immunostaining assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>). Moreover, the decreased neural marker expression in Pou3f1-depleted ESCs was restored by the overexpression of a <i>Pou3f1</i> coding sequence (CDS) lacking the 3\u2032 UTR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Cell aggregation assays were performed by co-culturing wild-type ESCs with either GFP-labeled control or Pou3f1-overexpressing ESCs in serum-free medium. The neural differentiation of wild-type ESCs was not affected by Pou3f1-overexpressing ESCs in the culture system (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>), indicating that Pou3f1 promoted neural differentiation cell-autonomously.

To address this question, we performed ESC-derived EpiSC (ESD-EpiSC) colony formation assays (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2010a</a>) using day 2 ESC aggregates in serum-free medium. The results demonstrated that both control and Pou3f1-overexpressing ESCs generated similar numbers of homogeneous compact monolayer EpiSC-like colonies that displayed weak alkaline phosphatase activity (AKP) and similar levels of Oct4 expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>).

GFP-labeled control, Pou3f1-knockdown (Pou3f1-KD), and Pou3f1-overexpressing (Pou3f1-OE) ESCs were injected into E2.5 blastocysts and transferred into pseudopregnant mice, respectively. The developmental potentials of these cells were examined after 7 days post-transplantation (at E9.0\u2212E9.5). Chimeras were generated from these three ES cell lines (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The number of GFP-positive cells in various tissues was ascertained in sections of chimeric embryos. The control ESCs contributed to a wide range of germ layer lineages, including neuroectoderm (NE), mesenchyme (M), somite (S), heart, gut, and extraembryonic ectoderm, at similar percentages (\u223c60%) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Surprisingly, only Pou3f1-KD ESCs failed to contribute to the neuroectoderm, but were widely identified in non-neural lineages (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). By contrast, Pou3f1-OE ESCs preferred incorporation into the neuroectoderm and displayed a considerably reduced contribution to non-neural tissues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). These results indicate that Pou3f1 promotes the neural fate commitment of pluripotent stem cells in vivo."

Interestingly, a large percentage of Pou3f1-binding sites (47%) were located in distal regions more than 50 kb away from known or predicted transcription start sites (TSS). Only a small percentage of Pou3f1 binding sites resided in 5\u2032 proximal regions (0\u20131 kb and 1\u20135 kb), reflecting the property of Pou3f1 to control transcription primarily through distal enhancers. To investigate whether Pou3f1 binding to the genomic regions exerts functional consequences through regulating targeted gene expression, we integrated the ChIP-seq data with the RNA-seq data. Among the 4674 Pou3f1-binding genes, 430 genes were modulated significantly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis revealed that genes up-regulated by Pou3f1 were primarily involved in neural differentiation processes, such as neuron differentiation, neuron development, and axonogenesis, whereas Pou3f1-down-regulated targets were highly enriched in pattern specification and in embryonic morphogenesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

Intriguingly, the downstream targets of important morphogens, such as <i>Gata4</i> in the BMP pathway as well as <i>Myc</i> and <i>Dkk1</i> in the Wnt pathway, were also bound by Pou3f1. However, the expression of these genes was down-regulated by Pou3f1 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Pou3f1 genomic binding was confirmed by ChIP-qPCR (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

As a transcription factor, Pou3f1 contains three domains: the amino-terminal region, the POU domain, and the HOMEO domain.

Our ChIP-seq data revealed that Pou3f1 binds to the N2 enhancer region of the <i>Sox2</i> gene and promotes <i>Sox2</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). To further confirm this regulation, luciferase assays were conducted using a reporter construct driven by the <i>Sox2</i>N2 enhancer.

Similarly, ChIP assays revealed that wild-type Pou3f1, but not Pou3f1-\u0394HOMEO, bound to the <i>Sox2</i>N2 enhancer, and neither of them bound to the <i>Sox2</i>N1 enhancer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

Luciferase assays were performed with a four-repeat BMP responsive element (BRE)-driven reporter (<a href=\"#bib22\">Katagiri et al., 2002</a>) to examine BMP activity in ESCs and in P19 cells. Pou3f1 knockdown increased BRE activity in ESCs with or without BMP4 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), whereas Pou3f1 overexpression partially inhibited BRE-luc activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Furthermore, among the several known functional domains, only the HOMEO domain was necessary to maintain the inhibitory effect of Pou3f1 on BMP signaling (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). ChIP assays using a Pou3f1 antibody were performed, and we found that the binding of wild-type Pou3f1, rather than Pou3f1-\u0394HOMEO, was specifically enriched at the BRE region of the <i>Id1</i> gene promoter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). We also performed ChIP assays using a pSmad1 antibody and found that pSmad1 bound to the BRE locus of the <i>Id1</i> promoter, but not to the 3\u2032 UTR region, in the presence of BMP4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, open column). Interestingly, Pou3f1 interfered with the binding of pSmad1 to the BRE locus of the <i>Id1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, filled column). Moreover, Pou3f1 repressed BMP-induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). We also observed that Pou3f1 did not affect the stimulation, degradation, dephosphorylation, or intracellular translocation of pSmad1 (data not shown), excluding the fact that Pou3f1 regulates the BMP pathway through a signaling cascade. Together, these results suggest that Pou3f1 may inhibit BMP signaling by interfering with pSmad1 binding to the regulatory elements and then repressing the transcription of target genes."

The <i>Pou3f1</i> gene expression profiles in mouse embryos in vivo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zwart et al., 1996</a>) and of ESC differentiation in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) imply that Pou3f1 may also participate in early neural development. Indeed, the shRNA-mediated knockdown of <i>Pou3f1</i> in ESCs results in the reduced expression of the neural markers <i>Sox1</i>, <i>Pax6</i>, and <i>Tuj1</i> in serum-free medium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). However, the compensation of the POU III member Brn2 may be one of the reasons for the mild effects observed during ESC neural differentiation after <i>Pou3f1</i> depletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Brn2 compensation and the different ESC lines and culture system used potentially explain why the Pou3f1 knockdown effects are not reported in Iwafuchi-Doi's study (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</a>). On the other hand, our results are consistent with their results indicating that the forced expression of <i>Pou3f1</i> promotes the expression of neural markers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</a>). Clearly, Pou3f1 is necessary and sufficient for ESC neural differentiation. Pou3f1-overexpressing or Pou3f1-knockdown ESCs generate EpiSC-like colonies that are similar to the control ESCs. However, the neural differentiation of Pou3f1-overexpressing or Pou3f1-knockdown EpiSCs is markedly different from the control EpiSCs, suggesting that Pou3f1 functions specifically during the neural transition from the epiblast to neural progenitor cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Furthermore, in our blastocyst injection study, the contribution of Pou3f1-knockdown ESCs to the neuroectoderm was severely impaired (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), indicating that Pou3f1 most likely functions cell-autonomously during the neural fate commitment of pluripotent stem cells in vivo. Our findings revealed that Pou3f1 is an essential transcription factor required for the intrinsic neural differentiation of pluripotent stem cells."

                        "text": "Cell fate determination is regulated in a step-wise fashion via the activation or inhibition of lineage specification factors (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pfister et al., 2007</a>). Several transcription factors, including <i>Pax6</i>, <i>Sox2</i>, <i>Zfp521</i>, <i>Zic1</i>, and <i>Zic2</i>, promote neural gene expression and play roles in the derivation of the anterior neural plate (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kamiya et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2010b</a>). <i>Zfp521</i> and <i>Zic1/2</i> are important for neural fate consolidation rather than initiation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aruga, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kamiya et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</a>). To date, the intrinsic modulators essential for the early neural initiation event have not been identified. In this study, the combination of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq enabled us to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms governing Pou3f1-mediated neural fate commitment in ESCs at the genome-wide level and to determine whether Pou3f1 is involved in the initiation of neural differentiation. Our results indicate that <i>Pax6</i>, <i>Sox2</i>, <i>Zfp521</i>, and dozens of other known neural fate-promoting genes are enhanced by Pou3f1 overexpression during ESC differentiation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4 and 5</a>). Furthermore, ChIP-seq data reveal that Pou3f1 is enriched at the regulatory regions of <i>Pax6</i>, <i>Sox2</i>, <i>Zfp521</i>, <i>Zic1</i>, and <i>Zic2</i> genomic loci (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that <i>Pou3f1</i> directly activates these neural fate-promoting genes. Surprisingly, <i>Pou3f1</i> did not bind the <i>Sox2</i>N1 enhancer, which controls <i>Sox2</i> posterior neural plate expression; <i>Pou3f1</i> preferentially binds to the <i>Sox2</i>N2 enhancer, which drives <i>Sox2</i> anterior neural plate expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4 and 5</a>). This result is consistent with the in vivo <i>Pou3f1</i> and <i>Sox2</i> overlapping expression patterns during neural fate commitment. Our results are also consistent with the notion that the anterior-most portion of the epiblast constitutes the primitive neural identity following neural induction (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andoniadou and Martinez-Barbera, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, our observations confirm the hypothesis proposed in a recent study (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kamiya et al., 2011</a>) that <i>Pou3f1</i> functions upstream of <i>Zfp521</i> during ESC neural differentiation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4 and 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Pou3f1 is most likely an intrinsic neural initiation factor that participates in the transition of pluripotent stem cells to NPCs by directly activating a group of key neural fate-promoting genes."

                        "text": "In addition to intrinsic factors, several extrinsic signals involved in early neural fate commitment have been intensively studied, including BMPs and Wnts. However, how BMP/Wnt inhibitory activities are alleviated to secure neural fate commitment has not been fully elucidated. BMP and Wnt signals function partially through their downstream genes (<a href=\"#bib46\">ten Berge et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Varlakhanova et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Ying et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2010a</a>). Unlike <i>Zfp521</i>, which did not affect BMP signaling (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kamiya et al., 2011</a>), the expression of a few genes related to BMP and Wnt pathways was regulated by Pou3f1 knockdown or by overexpressing in EBs at day 4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). However, this regulation was not evident in ESCs or in EBs at day 2 (data not shown). This finding suggests that Pou3f1 interferes with the BMP/Wnt signaling pathways during the process of neural conversion from epiblast to NPCs. Moreover, Pou3f1 is recruited to the genomic loci of many downstream targets of BMP and Wnt signals, such as <i>Id1</i>, <i>Id2</i>, <i>Myc</i>, and <i>Axin2</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also found that Pou3f1 represses the transcriptional activation of a BMP responsive element (BRE) by BMP4 and of a TCF optimal promoter (TOP) by Wnt3a (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our data further suggest that the binding of pSmad1 to the BRE locus is potentially compromised in the presence of Pou3f1, which results in the repression of BMP signaling pathway activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). However, other possibilities, such as the recruitment of repressing cofactors by Pou3f1, could not be excluded by the present study. Notably, Pou3f1 overexpression enables neural differentiation even in the presence of BMP4 or Wnt3a (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We propose that the Pou3f1-dependent repression of the BMP and Wnt signaling pathways and the activation of intrinsic neural lineage genes together are involved in the neural fate-promoting activity of Pou3f1."

This study provides a better understanding of the internal mechanism of neural initiation. Nonetheless, many questions concerning this process remain unanswered, such as whether the dual regulatory mechanism of Pou3f1 is also utilized to initiate the mouse neural program in vivo, whether this two-way modulating processes occurs simultaneously or in a sequential, temporal manner, and how the controversial activation/inhibition activities of the Pou3f1 transcription factor is achieved. All these unanswered questions lay the foundation for exciting future work concerning the interplay between the extrinsic and intrinsic cues during early embryonic neural fate commitment."

The SOAP version 2.20 alignment tool was used to align ChIP-Seq reads to the mouse genome build mm9 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2009</a>). Only reads with less than two mismatches that uniquely mapped to the genome were used in subsequent analyses. Using FindPeaks Homer software, Pou3f1 binding peaks with fourfold greater normalized tags were identified in ChIP experiments compared with the control (<a href=\"#bib13\">Heinz et al., 2010</a>). We calculated the distance from the peak centers to the annotated transcription start sites (TSS) and then defined the nearest genes as peak-related genes."

Pou3f1-dependent direct regulation of the So<i>x2</i>N2 enhancer serves as additional support for its neutralization function. These factors synergistically contribute to neuroectoderm formation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</a>); Pou3f1 controls their expression intrinsically and then promotes early neural fate commitment. On the other hand, the repression of extrinsic signals is essential for neural fate commitment. We demonstrate that the Pou3f1-dependent repression of BMP and Wnt signaling genes occurs at the transcriptional level (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Pou3f1 coordinates the expression of both endogenous factors and exogenous signals at the transcriptional level, which is a fast and efficient approach to regulating cell fate determination."

Thus, we sought to address whether the compensation by other POU III family members, Brn1 and Brn2, plays a role in Pou3f1 depletion. First, we examined the expression patterns of these genes during ESC neural differentiation and observed that Brn1 and Brn2 are up-regulated in serum-free medium after day 5 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2A</a>), which occurs much later than Pou3f1. Consistently, in mouse embryos <i>in vivo</i>, Pou3f1 expression is detected at E5.5, which occurs much earlier than neural induction in the mouse embryo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zwart et al., 1996</a>). In addition, Brn1 and Brn2 expression is only detected after E8.5 (<a href=\"http://dev.biologists.org/search?author1=Maxime+Bouchard%26sortspec=date%26submit=Submit\">Maxime Bouchard</a> et al., 2005).

In addition, when both Pou3f1 and Brn2 were simultaneously knocked-down by co-transfection with lentiviral-mediated shRNAs, Brn1 expression was not affected (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2C</a>). Then, the expression of neural markers decreased more dramatically in the Pou3f1 and Brn2 double-knockdown cells compared with control or Pou3f1 knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2D</a>). This information was added to the revised manuscript. Together, these results suggest that Brn2 potentially compensates for Pou3f1 depletion."

Typically, a gain-of-function analysis in embryos and tissues is executed through the ectopic expression of a gene within the physiological range. However, in the cultured cells, gain-of-function is performed by overexpression, which will lead the gene expression level higher than the physiological range. To answer this question, we examined <i>Pou3f1</i> expression patterns during ESC neural differentiation in control, Dox-inducible and in Pou3f1-stable overexpression cell lines. We found that the <i>Pou3f1</i> expression peaked at days 2-4 of ESC neural differentiation in control cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 2</a>), which is consistent with the data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>. During the same period, Pou3f1 expression levels in the Dox-inducible and stable lines were approximately two-fold higher compared with control cells; except that Dox-induced Pou3f1 expression displayed a considerably higher peak at day 1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 2</a>). After day 5, all three cell lines displayed similar <i>Pou3f1</i> expression levels."

In contrast, ESC neural differentiation was inhibited in serum-containing medium, which contains BMP and other neural inhibitory signals. In addition, the percentage of NPCs is considerably reduced compared with serum-free medium after 8 days of differentiation (data not shown). The serum-containing medium is more suitable for the gain-of-function analysis of neural fate-promoting factors. Thus, we performed Pou3f1 knockdown experiments in serum-free medium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B-D</a>) and Pou3f1 overexpression assays in serum-containing medium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1E-G</a>).
