Yet research in collective behavior has largely neglected habitat influences on movement. Here we integrate simultaneous, high-resolution, tracking of wild baboons within a troop with a 3-dimensional reconstruction of their habitat to identify key drivers of baboon movement. A previously unexplored social influence \u2013 baboons\u2019 preference for locations that other troop members have recently traversed \u2013 is the most important predictor of individual movement decisions. Habitat is shown to influence movement over multiple spatial scales, from long-range attraction and repulsion from the troop\u2019s sleeping site, to relatively local influences including road-following and a short-range avoidance of dense vegetation. Scaling to the collective level reveals a clear association between habitat features and the emergent structure of the group, highlighting the importance of habitat heterogeneity in shaping group coordination."

Yet research in collective behavior has largely neglected habitat influences on movement. Here we integrate simultaneous, high-resolution, tracking of wild baboons within a troop with a 3-dimensional reconstruction of their habitat to identify key drivers of baboon movement. A previously unexplored social influence \u2013 baboons\u2019 preference for locations that other troop members have recently traversed \u2013 is the most important predictor of individual movement decisions. Habitat is shown to influence movement over multiple spatial scales, from long-range attraction and repulsion from the troop\u2019s sleeping site, to relatively local influences including road-following and a short-range avoidance of dense vegetation. Scaling to the collective level reveals a clear association between habitat features and the emergent structure of the group, highlighting the importance of habitat heterogeneity in shaping group coordination."

Maintaining cohesion with conspecifics can benefit individuals by reducing predation risk, improving foraging efficiency (<a href=\"#bib32\">Krause and Ruxton, 2002</a>), and, in some cases, by enhancing sensing of environmental gradients (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berdahl et al., 2013</a>). For social animals moving in complex, heterogeneous environments, individual decisions and the resulting collective movement patterns are likely to be driven by a combination of factors, including habitat and social influence. Despite this, studies of collective motion have tended to discount the potential role of environmental complexity by either conducting experiments in relatively simple or featureless environments composed of mostly unobstructed space, as in many lab experiments (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buhl et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Katz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Herbert-Read et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rosenthal et al., 2015</a>) (but see [<a href=\"#bib4\">Berdahl et al., 2013</a>]), or when they do consider animals moving in structured environments, by focusing only on social influences on movement (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biro et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Strandburg-Peshkin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">King and Sueur, 2011</a>). Conversely, recent research in the growing area of movement ecology (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nathan et al., 2008</a>) has yielded much insight into the internal factors and habitat-driven influences underlying animal movement patterns\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Coulon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hodson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dickson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Leblond et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Northrup et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Johnson et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">McLean et al., 2016</a>), yet here the social drivers of movement are only beginning to be incorporated (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vanak et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Potts et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Latombe et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Basille et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "Habitat structure could alter collective movement patterns in a variety of ways. At the individual level, animals can exhibit goal-directed movement toward or away from certain habitat features (<a href=\"#bib44\">Polansky et al., 2015</a>). They can also be constrained by physical features of the landscape such as steep hills or dense vegetation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wall et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">McLean et al., 2016</a>). At the collective level, these influences may result in changes to the organization, coordination, and movement patterns of entire groups. For example, theoretical models suggest that when some individuals within a collectively-moving group exhibit goal-directed movement, an elongated group structure can emerge (<a href=\"#bib13\">Couzin et al., 2005</a>). The role of habitat structure could manifest itself both by altering the frequency with which groups exhibit characteristic structures (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tunstr\u00f8m et al., 2013</a>), or by forcing the group into entirely new structures that would otherwise not occur. Habitat factors such as vegetation density could constrain the extent to which animals can coordinate their movement, both by limiting the flow of information (e.g. by reducing visibility to other group members) and by imposing physical constraints on where and how fast animals can move. Moreover, both individual movement rules and emergent group structure could be altered by environmental context, leading groups to be observed in different states or exhibit different behaviors depending on the area of their home range they occupy on a moment-to-moment basis. Thus, to understand how the varied patterns of group spatial organization and movement dynamics seen in nature emerge, taking the habitat into account is likely to be of critical importance."

Moreover, by contrast with studies assessing broad-scale habitat selection (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dickson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fortin et al., 2005</a>), in order to investigate decision-making at the local scale at which within-group social interactions occur, a finer-scale characterization of both the movements of animals and the environmental structure is required. In recent years, there has been an explosion of technological advances in both animal tracking (<a href=\"#bib31\">Krause et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kays et al., 2015</a>) and remote sensing (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson and Gaston, 2013</a>). Advances in GPS tracking capabilities now make it possible to collect data at a high enough spatial and temporal resolution that fine-scale movement decisions and social interactions can be resolved (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nagy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">King et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Giuggioli et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Strandburg-Peshkin et al., 2015</a>). At the same time, the increased consumer availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), coupled with computational advances in image stitching and three-dimensional landscape reconstruction, have made these tools increasingly accessible to researchers in biology (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson and Gaston, 2013</a>). Thus, we have only recently developed the capacity to address the influence of environmental heterogeneity on collective movement in the wild."

Baboon troops, which range in size from a few to over a hundred individuals, normally remain cohesive while foraging throughout the day, despite traveling long distances over variable routes through a heterogeneous savanna habitat (<a href=\"#bib9\">Byrne, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cheney and Seyfarth, 2008</a>). Olive baboons are generalist omnivores, and typically feed on dispersed and widespread resources throughout their range. The two major predators of baboons are leopards and lions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cowlishaw, 1994</a>). Leopards, which will kill baboons both during the day and at night, are very common at the study site. To avoid predation at night, baboons choose safe sleeping sites and generally return to the same site each evening (although we observed our study troop temporarily changing sleeping site after the end of the study period after a leopard was observed at their sleeping site the previous night). Lions are much less common at the study site, and were unlikely to represent a major threat to our study group."

While analysis of these movement data alone yielded insights into the social processes underlying collective movement, this work neglected the potentially important influence of habitat structure, both on the decisions of individuals and on the emergent collective behavior of the group."

Step selection is a widely employed framework for assessing the environmental drivers of animal movement patterns (<a href=\"#bib51\">Thurfjell et al., 2014</a>). Animal movements are considered as sets of discrete steps through a landscape, and probabilistic models are fitted to attempt to predict the next location an animal will move to out of a set of available options (herein <i>potential locations</i>), based on a set of features associated with each option. Alternative options are drawn from a distribution of step lengths (distance traveled during each step) and turning angles (angle between consecutive step directions), thus controlling for these basic properties of movement. The resulting model fits can thus be used to infer which environmental features are relevant to animal movement decisions, and their relative strengths of influence. Step selection models have previously been employed to infer the habitat preferences of animals (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fortin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Coulon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hodson et al., 2010</a>), as well as their responses to distributions of predators (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fortin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Basille et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Latombe et al., 2014</a>), and competitors (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vanak et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Potts et al., 2014</a>).

To infer <i>which</i> habitat and social factors exert the greatest influence over baboon movement decisions, we compute the relative feature weight of each predictor using multi-model inference (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#fig11\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 5</a>; see Supplementary methods). We find that the top-ranked predictor (highest feature weight) of whether a baboon moved to a given location is the number of other baboons that had occupied that location within the recent past (<i>recently used</i> feature, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The best supported time scale associated with this effect is approximately 4.5 min (<a href=\"#fig14\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 8</a>); in other words, baboons show a preference to move to locations that have been occupied by many of their troop-mates within that timescale."

We find that the <i>recently used</i> predictor achieves the top rank even when this control predictor is included, suggesting that locations recently used by conspecifics are attractive to baboons above and beyond the effect of physical suitability.

The direction relative to the location of the sleep site emerges as an important predictor of individual movement decisions (<i>sleep site dir</i> feature ranked second, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), with baboons tending to move away from the sleep site in the morning and towards it in the evening. Thus this spatial feature determines a general direction of travel for the group that is dynamic across the day. More locally, whether a location is on a road influences its probability of being selected (<i>roads</i> feature, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), and in particular, baboons show a strong preference to follow roads once on them (<a href=\"#fig16\">Appendix 1\u2014figures 10</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig17\">11</a>). By contrast, smaller game paths (<a href=\"#fig9\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 3</a>), although much more numerous than man-made roads, have a less pronounced influence on baboon movement decisions (<i>paths</i> feature is low-ranked, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Over a similarly local scale (2.5\u00a0m, <a href=\"#fig12\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 6</a>), baboons tend to avoid locations of high vegetation density (<i>env density</i> feature, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This feature, along with the change in elevation required to reach a location, and the fraction of visible neighbors, plays a more minor role, but all are still supported by multi-model inference (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, our model-fitting results support that baboons incorporate a variety of both habitat and social elements operating over a range of spatial scales when making movement decisions. From the model fits, we can also generate a data-driven 'preference landscape' to visualize the influence of each of these features on individual movement decisions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

To do so, we start by characterizing how baboon movement decisions are influenced by the previous locations of their troop mates (the top-ranked feature according to our multi-model inference results). We compare the properties of each real location where a baboon moved to those of an alternative location that it could have moved, with alternative locations generated by randomly drawing from the baboon\u2019s step length / turning angle distribution. For each pair of real and alternative locations, we randomly select one location and denote it <i>location 1</i>, with the other denoted <i>location 2</i>. We then compute the probability that <i>location 1</i> was the real location, as a function of the difference between the number of other baboons that had recently occupied <i>location 1</i> and the number that had recently occupied <i>location 2</i>. The result is a sigmoidal response (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), where the true location selected by a baboon is likely to be the one that more of its troop-mates have recently passed through, with this probability increasing as the difference in the number of troop-mates to occupy the two alternative locations increases. This result is consistent with the previously-observed preference of baboons to follow the majority of troop-mates (<a href=\"#bib48\">Strandburg-Peshkin et al., 2015</a>), but in this case the preference is shown to be for a particular location in space rather than a general direction of travel. Thus as baboons move through space they effectively \u2018pave the way\u2019 for their troop mates, who tend to follow in the footsteps of larger subgroups."

When comparing two potential locations, if we subset our data to instances in which one potential location is on a road and the other is not, a clear bias towards choosing the on-road location emerges (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a>, red lines), and is particularly prominent when the focal baboon starts on a road (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This result suggests that both roads and the previous locations of troop members strongly influence the locations where baboons choose to move, with the relative contributions of these two influences reflected in the shape of the sigmoidal curve (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The sleep site direction is found to introduce a similar bias (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>), where in the morning baboons were more likely to choose locations farther away from the sleep site, and conversely for the evening. Taken together, these results illustrate how habitat influences on movement weigh against social influence.

For example, models fitted using data that correspond to different times of day demonstrate that the importance of roads is stronger in the morning and evening relative to the middle of the day. The direction of the sleep site also plays a larger role in the morning and evening than in the midday. This suggests that baboons are effectively \u2018commuting\u2019 to and from foraging locations during the start and end of each day (<a href=\"#fig21\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 15A</a>). These individual-level changes are coupled with changes to group structure at the collective level\u00a0. During morning and evening, the troop tends to be more elongated, and to move more often in a directed manner with lower tilt (<a href=\"#fig24\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 18</a>, <a href=\"#fig28\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 22</a>), all of which would be expected based on either more goal-directed movement (toward or away from the sleep site) and/or movement that utilizes roads. Indeed, the group spent considerably more time on roads during morning and evening than during the midday (12.1% in morning and evening vs. 7.5% during midday, <a href=\"#fig29\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 23</a>).

Thus, in dense environments, baboons\u2019 movement decisions become more strongly influenced by local-scale heterogeneity in vegetation relative to other factors. At the group level, high-density areas are associated with lower group polarization, as well as slower troop speed and less directed travel (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These changes suggest that vegetation structure plays an important role in constraining the degree of movement coordination in animal groups. Similarly, though animal <i>paths</i> are low ranked in feature weight when models are fitted across all data, their importance at the individual level\u00a0increases in areas with a particularly high density of paths (<a href=\"#fig21\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 15C</a>).

Computing the feature weights of each of these predictors via multi-model inference reveals that the habitat features receive larger weights across all group-level properties than does time of day (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This result suggests that group structure is shaped more by the current habitat the baboons occupy than by the temporal context. The fits also reveal that roads and areas of high path density are associated with similar changes to group structure \u2013 i.e. groups become faster, more elongated, and more polarized \u2013 but that roads are generally a stronger predictor of these changes (higher feature weight, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). By contrast, in dense habitats essentially the reverse of this pattern is seen."

It is perhaps surprising, then, that these parallel streams of effort, which both aim to understand and quantify the patterns of animal distribution and movement observed in nature, have so far had relatively little interaction with one another (but see [<a href=\"#bib45\">Potts et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berdahl et al., 2013</a>]). By exploiting recent advances in GPS tracking, remote sensing, and analytical methods, we uncover a range of both habitat and social influences, operating over varied spatial scales, which exert influence on the local movement decisions made by individual baboons and ultimately the aggregate structure and dynamics of the group. Changes in coordination and group spatial organization as a function of environmental factors will have important consequences for understanding both the mechanistic basis of group coordination and its costs and benefits."

Moreover, habitat influences extend beyond the level of individual decisions to the collective dynamics of the group, leading to changes in emergent group structure and coordination in different environmental contexts. This effect is manifested in our dataset in the fast movement and elongated group structures formed on roads and areas of high path density, and the decrease in coordination when moving through dense habitats. These changes could reflect direct habitat constraints on movement (such as physical barriers to movement), but also behavioral changes associated with different habitats (such as a shift from foraging to directed travel in different environments)."

The importance of roads is consistent with studies in other species which suggest that roads may facilitate animal movement (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dickson et al., 2005</a>), perhaps by serving as navigational landmarks (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mann et al., 2014</a>). This hypothesis is consistent with the weaker influence of paths in our analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), whose sheer abundance and tortuosity could make them less useful as navigational aids. We also found that roads were more important predictors of baboon movement in the mornings and afternoons than during the middle of the day. This temporal difference is likely to reflect the needs of the troop to travel away from their core zone (near their sleeping site) to forage (<a href=\"#fig29\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 23</a>). In fact, baboons in our troop often travelled 5\u20136 kms per day during the study period, probably because conditions were dry and food, although not scarce, was not abundant enough close to their sleep site to sustain the entire troop."

Baboons\u2019 tendency to follow in the footsteps of others emerges as the highest-ranked predictor of individual movement decisions in our analysis. There are several possible explanations for this finding. The first possibility is that individuals are following others to resource patches within the landscape. However, in order for this effect to be driving our result, our study troop would have to be foraging on patches that are both ephemeral (so that they would not be accounted for by the <i>ever used</i> feature we included as a control) and slowly depleting (so that followers would benefit from visiting locations where others previously foraged). Our observation in the field is that the troop forages on mixed resources that are widely distributed (e.g. grass roots and prickly pear fruit), meaning that this explanation seems unlikely. Alternatively, the importance of following others could reflect a risk reduction strategy, since locations that conspecifics have recently passed through have already been effectively \u2018pre-screened\u2019 for threats such as leopards or venomous snakes. This hypothesis is supported by the decrease in the importance rank of the <i>recently used</i> feature when the troop is in open habitats (<a href=\"#fig21\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 15B</a>), as there are likely to be fewer anti-predator benefits to be gained by following others in open areas. A third possibility is that baboons moving through the landscape trample local vegetation, in turn making recently-used paths easier to follow. However, if this were the case, then we would expect existing animal paths to also emerge as important predictors of movement, which in our case they did not (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). A final possibility is that since following in the footsteps of others is a less cognitively demanding task than carving out one\u2019s own path (<a href=\"#bib43\">Piyapong et al., 2007</a>), by generally following these paths baboons are reducing the cognitive effort of navigation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kool et al., 2010</a>). Future work, including explicit measurement of both the resource distribution and the behavior that individuals engaged in while moving could help discriminate among these possibilities. Regardless of the explanation, baboons\u2019 tendency to follow in the footsteps of others is likely to have consequences for the aggregate space use patterns of baboon troops, with troops making use of a smaller portion of the area within their surroundings than would be naively expected if individuals were moving more randomly within the troop\u2019s boundaries, which in turn could alter their impact on the environment around them."

Where individuals position themselves within groups is thought to reflect a trade-off between forging new ground to find resources and being exposed to predators (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hirsch, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Krause, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Parrish and Edelstein-Keshet, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hirsch, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Teichroeb et al., 2015</a>). While work in this area has typically focused on how this tradeoff can drive differences in the amount of time individuals spend at the front vs back of the group, or in the center vs periphery, our results suggest that the extent to which animals follow in each others footsteps is another dynamic which should be considered, as this factor will have an important impact on the rate at which individuals are exposed to new areas - and hence the rate at which they will encounter both new resources and stationary predators."

An exciting future direction would be to conduct longer-term or repeated sampling of a troop across the year to capture changing environmental conditions, and to investigate how these changes impact both individual decisions and group-level properties. For example, when conditions are very dry or very wet, do individual movement rules change, and do these conditions impact group structure? Wet conditions are likely to lead to more food, but also denser habitat and therefore more risk from ambush predators such as leopards. If predation is the primary reason individuals tend to move to locations where others have recently been, these conditions should increase the propensity for individuals to carefully follow others. Further, our study only accounted for short-term social drivers of movement. Recent theoretical (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bode et al., 2011</a>) and empirical (<a href=\"#bib27\">King et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">King and Sueur, 2011</a>) studies have highlighted potential for differences in social relationships to affect movement. Independent observations of affiliations, notably grooming relationships, could be also incorporated into our model to explicitly test when and how these inter-individual relationships are important for movement."

We did not apply any smoothing to the GPS data, but filled in the few short (1 s) gaps in the data using linear interpolation, as well as filtering out a small number of outlier data points (see Supplementary methods). Aerial imagery of the habitat was collected from 9\u201317 January, 2015 using an eBee fixed-wing UAV (Sensefly Ltd). The mapped area covered 3.3 km<sup>2</sup>, representing approximately 2/3 of the area covered by the baboon troop during the first 14 days (the period from which we analyzed tracking data). Although we had a gap between the two data collection periods, both had similar ecological conditions (dry season) and habitat characteristics (trees, roads, bushes) were unlikely to have changed much over this period. After collection, images were automatically combined using Postflight Terra 3D software (Pix4D) to reconstruct a three-dimensional point cloud image of the landscape, and these were used to identify all habitat features. All procedures were subject to ethical review and were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines set out by the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation of the Republic of Kenya (NACOSTI/P/15/5727/4608).

We quantified the group structure at each minute using six troop-level metrics (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). To characterize how group spatial structure and movement depended on context, we compared distributions of the metrics across different contexts by subtracting the histogram computed using all data from the histogram computed using data within each context. This allowed us to determine which areas of parameter space were over- and under- represented in a given context. We also fit linear models predicting each group-level property as a function of all possible combinations of habitat and temporal contexts, then computed AIC weights to determine the relative importance of each of these contexts in predicting each group-level property.

Seven baboons were too small to fit a collar, and were released immediately. Each of the remaining 26 individuals was chemically immobilized using Ketamine (15 mg/kg) and fitted with a GPS collar (e-Obs Digital Telemetry, Gruenwald, Germany) weighing less than 5% of its body weight. D-cell battery collars (300 g) were used for larger individuals, and C-cell battery collars (230 g) were used for smaller individuals. The collars were programmed to record baboon locations continuously at a rate of 1 Hz during daylight hours (06\u201318 hr). Because the collars sampled data continuously, position error was low. During a test walk in which collars were held 1 m apart, the average relative error was found to be &lt;0.26 m (95% CI: 0.03\u20130.69). One collar failed immediately, therefore we analyzed the data from the remaining 25 collared individuals. Due to the limited battery life of the C-cell collars, we analyzed only the first 14 days of collar deployment, when most collars were active. See <a href=\"#bib48\">Strandburg-Peshkin et al. (2015)</a> for more information on collar deployment, including the recording duration for each individual."

Occasionally, a device failed to log one or a few points, and in these cases we estimated the missing values using linear interpolation. This procedure was found to result in an error of less than 0.2 m (less than the GPS error), based on an analysis in which we randomly removed 5000 existing data points and compared their values to those estimated using linear interpolation. In addition, we found a few instances of unrealistic speeds in the data, suggesting GPS errors. Using the same linear interpolation algorithm, we identified points above the 99.9th percentile error between interpolated and observed data points (equivalent to speeds above 3.56 m/s, and replaced these with their linearly interpolated values. Overall, 7.4% of the data used was interpolated, with 7.2% of these being replacements of missing values."

Although the small-scale vegetation structure may have changed during this time period, the general positions of landscape features such as the locations of acacia trees, roads, etc. are unlikely to have dramatically changed.

MCC-LIDAR uses an algorithm based on the local curvature to differentiate areas in a point cloud image that are likely to be ground vs. non-ground objects. The algorithm has two parameters: the scale parameter (set at 1.5 here) and the threshold parameter (set at 0.3 m here). While visual inspection of the results confirmed that the ground classification algorithm had performed well on the majority of the mapped area, the algorithm often misclassified regions very near the river. All data within 50 m of the river were therefore excluded from our analyses. Because the sleep site was on the river, this also ensured that data from when the group was very near to the sleep site were not included in the analysis. Similarly, because the edges of the mapped region tended to be less reliably imaged, all data within 20 m of the map edge were excluded."

For each other baboon, we determined whether the direct line-of-sight from that location was clear (i.e. a line drawn from the location to the baboon was not blocked by vegetation or other non-ground objects), and we then computed the fraction of clear lines-of-sight across all other baboons. A line-of-sight was defined as blocked if it intersected with any non-ground pixels in the raster. This measure is therefore likely to somewhat underestimate the visibility, since some smaller objects that baboons might be able to see over could still be counted as blocking the view. However, our analysis did reduce this effect by removing very small-scale objects from the raster (see section above, and <a href=\"#fig8\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 2E</a>)."

Step selection functions (related to resource selection functions [<a href=\"#bib7\">Boyce and McDonald, 1999</a>]) are models that predict the future location of individual animals based on their current location and heading, and the features of the environment. The models can incorporate both the animal\u2019s movement characteristics (typically, its distribution of step lengths and turning angles) and any environmental features that are expected to be relevant, including features of the physical environment such as vegetation density and the locations of roads and rivers, and social features such as the locations and movements of conspecifics. Step selection analyses are increasingly employed to model the habitat preferences and home ranges of wild animals\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Fortin et al., 2005</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib51\">Thurfjell et al., 2014</a>), but to our knowledge have not before been used to look at within-group social interactions, likely due to the lack of tracking data from multiple animals within a single social group simultaneously. For a review of the application of step selection functions to ecological data, see (<a href=\"#bib51\">Thurfjell et al., 2014</a>)."

Whereas in temporal discretization, data points are recorded at a constant temporal rate (e.g. one point per second), in spatial discretization points are recorded at a constant spatial rate (e.g. one point for every 5 m moved). Using spatial discretization allows us to focus mainly on where animals moved rather than when they moved. This is important because baboons can spend long periods of time not moving, and a model fit using temporal discretization would be strongly biased by these periods. While the factors that govern a baboon\u2019s decision of when to move are interesting, they are not addressed here."

Start at the first location, and record this location as the first in the trajectory. This location becomes the reference location. At each time point, measure the distance between the baboon\u2019s current location and the reference location. When this distance exceeds a threshold radius value <i>R</i>, the next location is recorded. This location now becomes the new reference location and the process repeats. From this process of spatial discretization, one obtains a trajectory with one point approximately every <i>R</i> meters. An example of spatial discretization of a baboon\u2019s path is shown in <a href=\"#fig11\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 5A</a>. Note that if temporal sampling were continuous, spatially-discretized steps would be exactly <i>R</i> meters apart. However, in the case of discrete temporal sampling, this distance can be slightly larger than <i>R</i> because sometimes the animal moves from just below a distance <i>R</i> from the reference point, to a distance just above it within a single second."

This process was repeated for different values of <i>n</i> to assess whether results changed depending on the amount of data used in the fits. We found that while the actual values of the weights depended strongly on the number of subsets used, the rank order of features by their relative weight did not change depending on the value of <i>n</i> (<a href=\"#fig15\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 9</a>). This suggests that while we cannot claim to quantify the relative importance of different features exactly, we can be fairly confident in their order of importance in predicting baboon movement decisions.

For example, baboons could plausibly be responding to environment density over a range of spatial scales, and similarly for social density. We therefore performed a preliminary analysis to select the relevant scales for our subsequent step selection models. Following (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mashintonio et al., 2014</a>), we fit a series of models using different smoothing radii and computed the likelihood of each model. We then selected the spatial scale that produced the highest likelihood.

Here, we found that the likelihood of the models increased up to approximately 5 min into the past, and then either dropped or stayed relatively flat (<a href=\"#fig14\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 8</a>).

To elucidate the interplay between these three features, we directly compared their values for the location actually chosen by a baboon with those of a single non-chosen location, drawn from its step length / turning angle distribution. This is equivalent to the way in which step selection models control for the step length / turning angle distribution of individuals, but here rather than fitting models we simply compute the empirical probability of choosing one location (denoted location 1) over the other (denoted location 2) as a function of various features of the two locations."

We have made an effort throughout the manuscript to remove any claims about the novelty of studying habitat and social influences on movement within the same framework, which the reviewers rightly point out has been addressed in recent work (and which we have now referenced where relevant). Instead, we focus more specifically on integrating an exploration of habitat influences on movement into our understanding of collective behavior \u2013 both by disentangling within-group social interactions from interactions with fine-scale habitat features within wild animal groups, and by analyzing how the local habitat shapes emergent group-level properties, which we do think are the more novel and interesting aspects of our study."

Our results supplement the trends observed from the original histograms in which we presented how group shapes varies with habitat context. The additional results now also clarify the relative importance of these effects. Most importantly, the results reveal that habitat influences on group structure consistently outweigh the influence of time of day.

Alternatively, are the landscapes simply so lush that there is no risk of resource limitation among group members?
