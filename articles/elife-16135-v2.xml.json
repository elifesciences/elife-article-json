In Drosophila, the mushroom body (MB) is the major site of associative odor memory formation. Previously we described the anatomy of the adult MB and defined 20 types of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) that each innervate distinct MB compartments (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aso et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2014b</a>). Here we compare the properties of memories formed by optogenetic activation of individual DAN cell types. We found extensive differences in training requirements for memory formation, decay dynamics, storage capacity and flexibility to learn new associations. Even a single DAN cell type can either write or reduce an aversive memory, or write an appetitive memory, depending on when it is activated relative to odor delivery. Our results show that different learning rules are executed in seemingly parallel memory systems, providing multiple distinct circuit-based strategies to predict future events from past experiences."

In some cases, an animal is best served by making a prediction based solely on their most recent experience. In others, a series of experiences is integrated to make a probabilistic prediction, discounting an event experienced only once. How are such different strategies implemented in the brain? One idea is that individual components of a memory\u2014often called engrams\u2014are simultaneously stored in distinct sub-circuits whose outputs can then be combined upon recall to affect behavior. These sub-circuits would vary in their rules for writing, updating and retaining these engrams, having differences in synaptic plasticity and circuit properties (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hikosaka et al., 2014</a>). Experiments aimed at uncovering the mechanisms by which different forms of memory are established and maintained, and then coherently coordinated to drive behavior, are facilitated by using a model system in which the relevant cells and circuits can be identified and manipulated either individually or in specific combinations. In this report, we describe experiments performed in such a model system, the olfactory circuitry of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>."

Punishment or reward activates modulatory neurons that in turn cause changes in the synaptic weight matrix between the neurons representing the sensory cues and the output neurons, resulting in memory formation.

For odor delivery, valves were open for 60 s. For training, thirty 1 s pulses of red light (627 nm peak and 34.9 \u00b5W/mm<sup>2</sup> at the position of the flies) were applied over 60 s starting 5 s after valve opening. Experiments were done reciprocally: In one group of flies, odor A and B were 3-octanol and 4-methylcyclohexanol, respectively, while in a second group of flies, the odors were reversed. All flies went through the same initial training and test protocol, and then the flies, without removal from the arena, went through one of the four diagramed training and test protocols. Bottom: Time course of the performance index (PI) during first test period (from 4\u20136 min of the experiment; left) and second test period (from 10\u201312 min of the experiment; right). The PI is defined as [(number of flies in the odor A quadrants) - (number of flies in odor B quadrants)]/(total number of flies). The average PI of reciprocal experiments is shown. The overall PI, which is reported in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a> was calculated by averaging the PIs from the final 30 s of each test period (indicated by the black horizontal line on the time axis).

                        "text": "While these compartmental units share a similar general structure, there are important anatomical and functional differences between them. Each compartment contains only one of the three major classes of KCs: \u03b3, \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 and \u03b1/\u03b2. Anatomical data suggest that each MBON samples from ~90 to ~2000 KCs in one or two compartments, while each KC forms <i>en passant</i> synapses on 5\u20136 types of MBONs along its axon in the lobes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aso et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2014a</a>). During associative learning, each DAN is thought to modulate KC-MBON synapses only in its target compartment(s) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hige et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cohn et al., 2015</a>). Thus, the information encoded by KC activity might contribute to multiple distinct engrams by compartmental specific modulation of KC-MBON <i>en passant</i> synapses. A large body of previous work has established that the KCs, MBONs and DANs innervating individual compartments are differentially involved in forming memories with different valence\u2014that is, appetitive and aversive memories\u2014and with different stabilities (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zars et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Isabel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Krashes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Claridge-Chang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Aso et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sejourne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Trannoy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Burke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aso et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Placais et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pai et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">Aso et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ichinose et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yamagata et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Owald et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Huetteroth et al., 2015</a>). However little is known about the rules for writing and updating memory in each compartment. By using the anatomical map of the MB and cell type specific drivers we reported previously (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aso et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2014b</a>) in conjunction with newly developed behavioral assays, we have been able to establish that different compartments can employ vastly different learning rules."

However, it has not been determined if a single DAN cell type can drive both processes within the same compartment. Pairing one of two odors with activation of PPL1-\u03b31pedc, results in robust aversive memory to the paired odor (<a href=\"#bib5\">Aso et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). That memory is fully retained after 10\u2009min (blue line in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) but has largely decayed by 24\u2009hr (Figure 3B). Presentation of the odors alone a few minutes after training resulted in a modest reduction in the conditioned response (orange line in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). A second activation of the same DAN a few minutes after training in the absence of odor can almost completely abolish the conditioned response (red line in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Recent imaging data of the \u03b34 MBON (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cohn et al., 2015</a>) suggest that this reduction most likely results from restoration of the response of the MBON to the odor; that is, erasure of the memory. If, after the first training, contingencies are reversed such that the other odor is presented paired with DAN activation, the first memory is reduced and a memory of the new association is formed (purple line in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Taken together, these data indicate that the same DANs can write a new memory or reduce an existing conditioned response, enabling the flexibility to rapidly change the associations formed between a conditioned stimulus (CS), the odor, and an unconditioned stimulus (US) represented by dopamine release."

Our ability to precisely control DAN stimulation and odor presentation enabled us to examine the CS-US timing relationship (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We found that when PPL1-\u03b31pedc stimulation fell within a 30-s time window following the onset of a 10-s odor presentation, an aversive memory was formed (negative PI, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Interestingly, we observed that DAN stimulation that precedes odor presentation by 20 to 60\u2009s induced an appetitive memory (positive PI, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). These observations are consistent with the notion that it is the predictive aspect of CS-US timing that matters. When the timing is such that the CS predicts a subsequent aversive US, animals learn to avoid the CS. However, animals can also learn that the CS predicts the end of an aversive US, and are consequently attracted to the CS (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tanimoto et al., 2004</a>). It has been suggested that this timing dependency could result from the dynamics of the biochemical signaling cascade acting downstream of dopamine receptors (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yarali et al., 2012</a>)."

In behavioral assays, optogenetic activation of this MBON was shown to attract flies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aso et al., 2014b</a>). Taken together, these observations suggest that DAN activation paired with an odor produces an aversive behavioral response to that odor by decreasing the MBON\u2019s attractive output. Thus our data can be most easily explained if this single DAN can bi-directionally alter the strength of KC-MBON synapses depending on the presence and relative timing of odor-driven KC activity; a full testing of this model awaits additional physiological measurements."

Thus, for appetitive memory, the period when dopamine signaling resulted in the most robust memory formation was shifted slightly later relative to odor presentation; such a response profile might be an adaptation to the time required for converting ingested food to a nutritional reward signal.

Memory retention at certain time <i>t</i> is a function of the initial magnitude of memory following training, <i>I</i>, and the memory stability, <i>S</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ebbinghaus, 1885</a>). Note that while the initial memory score (<i>I)</i> depends on the amount of training, memory stability (<i>S)</i> is constant in each memory unit and is not altered by the amount of training. Based on this and previous studies (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hige et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aso et al., 2012</a>), we propose that to a first approximation individual MB compartments can be modeled as distinct memory units with different baseline acquisition rates and memory stabilities, which can be set independently. For aversive memory, we found memory stability and acquisition rate appear negatively correlated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, stable appetitive memory can be induced by brief training (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yamagata et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Huetteroth et al., 2015</a>)."

Making memory formation dependent on repetitive training might be beneficial by allowing an animal to ignore spurious one-time events. Recent work has shown that the \u03b32\u03b1\u20321 compartments play key roles in both sleep regulation and long-term memory (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sitaraman et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Haynes et al., 2015</a>). The observation that co-activation of PPL1-\u03b32\u03b1\u20321 and other DANs synergistically prolongs memory retention (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aso et al., 2012</a>) raises the possibility that PPL1-\u03b32\u03b1\u20321 might act broadly to facilitate memory consolidation by promoting sleep after learning."

For example, immediate memory after a single pairing with activation of PPL1-\u03b13 (MB630B) was barely detectable, although multiple activations resulted in 4-day memory (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In contrast, PPL1-\u03b31pedc (MB320C) activation resulted in robust immediate memory acquisition after a single round of training, but its activation failed to induce 4-day memory even after extensive spaced training (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These results imply the stability of memory is an intrinsic property of the MB compartment, rather than a consequence of the training protocol. In this view, repetitive training with naturalistic stimuli that activate many DAN cell types would recruit additional compartments with slower acquisition rates and the behaviorally assayed retention of memory would reflect the combined memories formed in different compartments (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). It remains an open question whether short-term memories are converted into long-term memories as biochemical changes in the same synapses or whether these memories are formed separately and in parallel. For olfactory learning in Drosophila, our data are consistent with a model in which memory formation and consolidation can occur independently and in parallel in individual MB compartments; this view does not exclude the possibility that network activity facilitates memory consolidation."

This compartment plays a key role in long-term appetitive memory of nutritious foods (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yamagata et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Huetteroth et al., 2015</a>) and has an unusual circuit structure: its MBON (MBON-\u03b11) appears to form synapses on the dendrites of the DAN that innervates the \u03b11 compartment (PAM-\u03b11) forming a recurrent circuit necessary for long-term memory formation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ichinose et al., 2015</a>). The \u03b11 compartment also showed the least ability to replace an older association with a new one (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This observation suggests that the initial memory may not be affected by the second training, resulting in co-existing appetitive memories for both odors. Indeed, flies were able to retain associations between each of two odors and PAM-\u03b11 (MB043C) activation, while only the most recently learned association was remembered with PPL1-\u03b31pedc (MB320C) activation (3F). The higher memory capacity of the \u03b11 compartment is not due to generalization, since training with one odor pair did not affect the innate odor preference observed with a different, untrained odor pair. Thus two distinct strategies for updating memories appear to be used in different MB compartments: (1) writing a new memory, while diminishing the old memory; or (2) writing a new memory, while retaining the old memory."

Such a model of independent memory storage should allow appetitive and aversive memories to be simultaneously formed for the same odor in different compartments. We tested this idea by simultaneously activating DANs to \u03b11 and \u03b31pedc while exposing flies to an odor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). When flies were tested immediately after training, the odor was strongly aversive, but the same odor became appetitive after 1 day. These results are most easily explained by simultaneous formation of an aversive memory in \u03b31pedc and an appetitive memory in \u03b11, with rapid decay of the memory in \u03b31pedc and slow decay in \u03b11 resulting in a shift in valence of the conditioned response over time. However, the fact that we observed strongly aversive immediate memory, rather than an intermediate response, suggests that the MB network non-linearly integrates these conflicting signals. The known feedforward connection between \u03b31pedc and \u03b11 provides a possible circuit mechanism (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aso et al. 2014a</a>).

We also found that wild type flies are capable of efficiently switching odor preference when they had conflicting sequential experiences of sugar reward followed by shock punishment with the same odor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

By analyzing individual memory components\u2013or engrams\u2013induced by local dopamine release, we found that the interpretation of a common odor representation carried by sparse KC activity to multiple compartments could be modified differently in each of those compartments. We do not know the mechanisms that generate these distinct learning rules. They could arise from differences in the dopamine release properties of different DAN cell types or from local differences in the biochemical response to dopamine signaling in each MB compartment. For example, KCs express four distinct dopamine receptors (<a href=\"#bib14\">Crocker et al., 2016</a>), which might be deployed differently in each compartment. Or they could originate from circuit properties: we know from anatomical (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tanaka et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aso et al., 2014a</a>), behavioral (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ichinose et al., 2015</a>) and functional imaging (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boto et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cohn et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Owald et al., 2015</a>) studies that MB compartments can communicate through connections between their extrinsic neurons, the DANs and MBONs, as well as by a layered network within the MB (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In the mammalian brain, associative memories are also stored as distributed and parallel changes with partially overlapping functions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Herry and Johansen, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hikosaka et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tonegawa et al., 2015</a>); for example, different populations of dopaminergic neurons develop representations of a visual objects\u2019 value with distinct learning rules (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2015</a>). We expect many of the underlying strategies and mechanisms may be shared between flies and other species. Our work provides a foundation for experiments aimed at understanding the molecular and circuit mechanisms by which distributed memory components are written with distinct rules and later integrated to guide memory-based behaviors."

The flow rate of input air from each of the four arms was maintained at 100\u2009mL/min throughout the experiments by mass-flow controllers, and air was extracted from the central hole at 400\u2009mL/min. Odors were delivered to the arena by switching the direction of airflow to the tubes containing diluted odors using solenoid valves. The odors were diluted in paraffin oil (Sigma\u2013Aldrich): 3-octanol (OCT; 1:1000; Merck) and 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH; 1:750; Sigma\u2013Aldrich), Pentyl acetate (PA: 1:5000; Sigma\u2013Aldrich) and ethyl lactate (EL: 1:5000; Sigma\u2013Aldrich). Shock and sugar conditioning was performed as previously described by using tubes with sucrose absorbed Whatman 3\u00a0MM paper or copper grids (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Aso et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al 2012</a>). For the experiments in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, a sheet of copper grid was placed at the bottom of arena. For appetitive memory assays, flies were starved for 24\u201348\u2009hr on 1% agar. Videography was performed at 30 frames per second and analyzed using Fiji (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a>). Statistical comparisons were performed (Prism; Graphpad Inc, La Jolla, CA 92037) using the Kruskal Wallis test followed by Dunn's post-test for multiple comparison, except those in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a> which used Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction to compare from zero."

However, the first critique of Reviewer 1 regarding back-crossing represents substantial amount of work if the current data were collected from flies that had not been back-crossed to a common genetic background. We hope that these flies were indeed back-crossed and it was an omission in the methods. If they had not been, after much discussion among the Reviewers and Reviewing Editor, we think that it is necessary to perform additional controls to exclude the possibility that the differences reported in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 3</a>,<a href=\"#fig3\">2</a> are due to different backgrounds of flies harboring individual transgenes."

A large body of prior work establishes that odor driven CS inputs are represented as sparse patterns of activity within the large ensemble of MB Kenyon cslls. US driven dopaminergic neuron inputs are thought to converge onto MB Kenyon cells in the MB lobes, which is the site of Kenyon cell synapses with output neurons. Recent work has established that the different sub-types of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and output neurons (MBONs) are each restricted within zones of the MB lobes. The anatomical organization of the MB Kenyon cell sub-types also implies that the DAN/MBON zones are restricted to sub-types of Kenyon cells. Layered onto this anatomical model is a large body of work that demonstrates that memory is processed through a series of genetically dissectible phases, that rely on different sub-sets of the MB Kenyon cells. This manuscript investigates very interesting questions about how the anatomical organization of the DANs and MBONs into sub-zones provide functional modules upon which each of the memory phases after appetitive vs aversive memories are built. The questions being asked are important and the world view that the authors propose is beautiful. So on a deep level, I am highly enthusiastic. Unfortunately, however, I have several foundational critiques that undermine the major conclusions of this study. This is really unfortunate, because I think that if properly done, this could be a really important piece of work.

A large body of prior work establishes that odor driven CS inputs are represented as sparse patterns of activity within the large ensemble of MB Kenyon cslls. US driven dopaminergic neuron inputs are thought to converge onto MB Kenyon cells in the MB lobes, which is the site of Kenyon cell synapses with output neurons. Recent work has established that the different sub-types of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and output neurons (MBONs) are each restricted within zones of the MB lobes. The anatomical organization of the MB Kenyon cell sub-types also implies that the DAN/MBON zones are restricted to sub-types of Kenyon cells. Layered onto this anatomical model is a large body of work that demonstrates that memory is processed through a series of genetically dissectible phases, that rely on different sub-sets of the MB Kenyon cells. This manuscript investigates very interesting questions about how the anatomical organization of the DANs and MBONs into sub-zones provide functional modules upon which each of the memory phases after appetitive vs aversive memories are built. The questions being asked are important and the world view that the authors propose is beautiful. So on a deep level, I am highly enthusiastic.
