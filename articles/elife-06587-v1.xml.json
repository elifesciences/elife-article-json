Here we report that the female gametophyte-expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP) LORELEI and the seedling-expressed LRE-like GPI-AP1 (LLG1) bind to the extracellular juxtamembrane region of FER and show that this interaction is pivotal for FER function. LLG1 interacts with FER in the endoplasmic reticulum and on the cell surface, and loss of LLG1 function induces cytoplasmic retention of FER, consistent with transport of FER from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane in a complex with LLG1. We further demonstrate that LLG1 is a component of the FER-regulated RHO GTPase signaling complex and that <i>fer</i> and <i>llg1</i> mutants display indistinguishable growth, developmental and signaling phenotypes, analogous to how <i>lre</i> and <i>fer</i> share similar reproductive defects. Together our results support LLG1/LRE acting as a chaperone and co-receptor for FER and elucidate a mechanism by which GPI-APs enable the signaling capacity of a cell surface receptor."

Here we report that the female gametophyte-expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP) LORELEI and the seedling-expressed LRE-like GPI-AP1 (LLG1) bind to the extracellular juxtamembrane region of FER and show that this interaction is pivotal for FER function. LLG1 interacts with FER in the endoplasmic reticulum and on the cell surface, and loss of LLG1 function induces cytoplasmic retention of FER, consistent with transport of FER from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane in a complex with LLG1. We further demonstrate that LLG1 is a component of the FER-regulated RHO GTPase signaling complex and that <i>fer</i> and <i>llg1</i> mutants display indistinguishable growth, developmental and signaling phenotypes, analogous to how <i>lre</i> and <i>fer</i> share similar reproductive defects. Together our results support LLG1/LRE acting as a chaperone and co-receptor for FER and elucidate a mechanism by which GPI-APs enable the signaling capacity of a cell surface receptor."

FER was initially identified as an essential regulator for female fertility (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huck et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rotman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Escobar-Restrepo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kessler and Grossniklaus, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Duan et al., 2014</a>); its expression in the female gametophyte is responsible for inducing rupture of an invading pollen tube to release sperm for fertilization. It is also required to prevent supernumerary pollen tube entrance to individual ovules, precluding polyspermy and maximizing seed yield. Thus <i>fer</i> mutant plants are severely female-deficient, producing few seeds. FER is, however, broadly expressed and absent only in pollen (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zimmermann et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Duan et al., 2010</a>); its functions intersect several major plant hormone signaling pathways, including auxin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Duan et al., 2010</a>), abscisic acid (ABA) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yu et al., 2012</a>), brassinosteroid, and ethylene (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Deslauriers and Larsen, 2010</a>). FER has also been shown to interact with the peptide hormone rapid alkalinization factor 1 (RALF1) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Haruta et al., 2014</a>). Therefore <i>fer</i> knock-out mutants are pleiotropic, with vegetative phenotypes attributable to defects in growth processes regulated by these hormones. FER also mediates susceptibility to the fungal pathogen powdery mildew (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kessler et al., 2010</a>) and has been implicated in mechano-sensing (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shih et al., 2014</a>). Thus it is likely that FER mediates distinct signals under different cellular and developmental conditions and environmental challenges."

We demonstrated that FER acts as a cell surface regulator for RAC/ROP-mediated NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to support polarized root hair growth in seedlings (<a href=\"#bib17\">Duan et al., 2010</a>), and induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pollen tube rupture and sperm release in the female gametophyte (<a href=\"#bib16\">Duan et al., 2014</a>). RAC/ROPs are known to mediate multiple signaling pathways that underlie normal plant growth and development, as well as stress-related responses (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nibau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wu et al., 2011</a>). ROS are ubiquitous and regulate a broad spectrum of cellular processes as diverse as cell growth and cell death (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carol and Dolan, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jaspers and Kangasjarvi, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Swanson and Gilroy, 2010</a>).

That FER might interact with carbohydrate moieties suggests the potential of mediating cell wall perturbations elicited by a battery of endogenous and environmental conditions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hematy and Hofte, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boisson-Dernier et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cheung and Wu, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lindner et al., 2012</a>) such as hormonal changes impacting cell growth and pathogen attacks eliciting cell wall restructuring. RALF1 is one of \u223c40 related secreted peptides in Arabidopsis that collectively are ubiquitously present, albeit individually they are all expressed at low levels and their functional roles in plant growth and development remain largely unexplored (<a href=\"#bib40\">Morato do Canto et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Srivastava et al., 2009</a>).

They localize to sphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched domains in the cell membrane where they are believed to play key roles in regulating cell surface signaling dynamics, although much remains to be learned about their precise functional mechanisms. In plants, GPI-APs play indispensable roles throughout development, required for cell wall biosynthesis, embryo viability, organogenesis, reproductive development, and male\u2013female interactive processes crucial for fertilization (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2014</a>). LORELEI (LRE) and LRE-like GPI-APs 1, 2, 3 (LLG1, 2, 3) are closely related but differentially expressed (<a href=\"#bib6\">Capron et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tsukamoto et al., 2010</a>). LRE is expressed exclusively in the ovule and loss of LRE function suppresses female fertility. <i>lre</i> mutants display reproductive phenotypes almost identical to those in <i>fer</i> mutants: a majority of <i>lre</i> and <i>fer</i> female gametophytes fail to induce rupture of the invading pollen tubes and their ovules are penetrated by multiple pollen tubes, yet fail to be fertilized because of the lack of sperm release. Here we show that LRE and LLG1 interact physically with FER and that they are crucial for its cell surface signaling capacity. Our results show partnering with related but differentially expressed proteins as a strategy for FER to execute its diverse biological roles; they also elucidate a novel mechanism for how GPI-APs might control cell surface signaling."

Furthermore, unlike wild type root hairs whose elongation was stimulated by auxin, <i>llg1</i> root hair defects were not mitigated by auxin and emerged root hairs in <i>llg1</i> remained shorter and substantially less sensitive to auxin stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), similar to <i>fer-4</i>.

While wild type seedling growth during RALF1 treatment was significantly retarded relative to the control seedlings, RALF1-treated <i>fer-4</i> and <i>llg1-2</i> seedlings grew comparably with their mock-treated counterparts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>).

Using the same protein pull-down strategy with ROP2, an Arabidopsis RAC/ROP, as bait, we observed that LLG1 was also pulled-down by ROP2 and in a guanine nucleotide-dependent manner, favored by GDP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), as was LRE (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Distinct families of effectors are targeted by activated RAC/ROPs to mediate downstream pathways (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lavy et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wu et al., 2011</a>). We observed that GTP-saturated ROP2 preferentially pulled-down the N-terminal fragment of the Arabidopsis RbohD-encoded NADPH oxidase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), indicating that it is also a RAC/ROP effector, as previously demonstrated for rice RAC1 and RbohB (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wong et al., 2007</a>). FER was identified as a ROPGEF interacting protein (<a href=\"#bib17\">Duan et al., 2010</a>) and GEF-RHO GTPase interaction is well established as has been demonstrated for ROPGEFs and RAC/ROPs in plants (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berken et al., 2005</a>). Results reported here therefore imply a tetrameric FER-LLG1/LRE-ROPGEF-RAC/ROP signaling complex mediated by preferential ROPGEF binding to GDP-bound inactive RAC/ROPs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Duan et al., 2010</a>), and once activated, the GTP-bound activated RAC/ROPs recruit NADPH oxidases to mediate downstream ROS-dependent processes. Emerging root hairs in <i>fer-4</i> and <i>llg1</i> seedlings began to extrude cytoplasm prior to their collapse (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), consistent with a weakening cell wall as a result of reduced ROS production (<a href=\"#bib19\">Foreman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Carol and Dolan, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Swanson and Gilroy, 2010</a>) that ultimately led to their collapse."

When transformed using the same amount of input FER-GFP DNA, <i>llg1-2</i>-derived protoplasts showed considerably stronger intracellular signals than their counterpart wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), consistent with intracellular FER-GFP signal being prominent in <i>llg1</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

Cell surface localization of FER-GFP was not obliterated from <i>llg1</i> protoplasts, but could clearly be resolved from its ER locations in cells where cortical ER was prominent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Co-transfection of <i>llg1</i> protoplasts by LLG1, epitope- or fluorescent protein-tagged LLG1 all restored cell membrane localization of FER-GFP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A,D</a>). On the other hand, expression of LLG1\u0394C, deleted of its C-terminal signature sequence for GPI-anchor modification (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kinoshita, 2014</a>), was considerably less effective in restoring FER-GFP to the plasma membrane of <i>llg1</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

An Arabidopsis ARF1 mutation, ARF1(Q71L), has been shown to block ER to Golgi trafficking and trap secretory proteins in the ER (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cai et al., 2011</a>). When co-expressed with the split Venus pair of FER\u0394K and LLG1, ARF1(Q71L) dramatically increased the number of BiFC-positive cells (to &gt;90%) showing intracellular yellow fluorescence. The reconstituted Venus signal often appeared perinuclear and in highly dynamic reticulate structures, typical of the ER (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1, 2</a>).

We observed that FER\u0394exJM, FER deleted of the extracellular juxtamembrane region (exJM, amino acid residues 365\u2013447) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) was less efficiently pulled-down by LLG1 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>), while the 83 amino acid exJM fragment was adequate to pull-down LLG1 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Yeast two-hybrid assays also indicated that exJM interacted with LLG1 and LRE (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>; <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, when <i>pFER::FER\u0394exJM-GFP</i> was transformed into Arabidopsis, FER\u0394exJM-GFP showed prominent intracellular localization in structures reminiscent of the ER (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D,E</a>; <a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). These intracellular FER\u0394exJM-GFP signals also colocalized with the ER-tracker dye (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>) and with RFP-ER when co-expressed in protoplasts (<a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). These observations together indicate that LLG1 and LRE target the exJM in FER for binding and that FER depends on these interactions for proper delivery to the cell membrane. They also imply that the phenotypes in <i>llg1</i> and <i>lre</i>, together spanning the developmental spectrum of <i>fer</i> phenotypes, could have largely resulted from diminished FER localization to its proper functional location in the cell membrane, thus mimicking loss of FER."

Partnering with and relying on this differentially expressed protein pair clearly would provide versatility for the almost constitutively expressed FER to control when and where signaling can be deployed. Moreover, modulation of LLG1 and LRE expression and their post-translational modifications, which involve numerous GPI-anchor biosynthetic and restructuring steps (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fujita and Kinoshita, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kinoshita et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2014</a>), would provide many opportunities for FER signaling activity to be fine-tuned to meet a broad range of developmental needs and environmental challenges. Given the spectrum of phenomena already known to be regulated by FER (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wolf and Hofte, 2014</a>), LLG1 and LRE could be of core importance to how FER treads among several signaling pathways to mediate growth and developmental processes regulated by multiple hormones, reproduction, and defense, each potentially controlled by distinct signals. FER is a member of a family of 17 related Arabidopsis receptor kinases, which are also conserved in other plant species (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hematy and Hofte, 2008</a>); LRE-like proteins are also present in other plants (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tsukamoto et al., 2010</a>). It is conceivable that pairing with their cognate LRE-like proteins also underlies the signaling functions of other FER-related receptor kinases. GPI-APs, including, for example, the COBRA family proteins (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schindelman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2013</a>) and arabinogalactan proteins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Demesa-Arevalo and Vielle-Calzada, 2013</a>), play crucial roles in plant growth and reproduction. Demonstrating that FER depends on LLG1 and LRE for efficient localization to the cell membrane (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6, 7</a>) elucidates not only a strategy whereby FER acquires its cell surface signaling capacity but also a mechanism with which GPI-APs might enable the signaling capacity of a broader set of cell surface receptors."

GPI-APs are secreted to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. LLG1 and LRE binding to the exJM domain of FER (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) is consistent with their being tethered to the cell membrane via the GPI anchor, thus facilitating interactions with FER immediately along the outer cell surface. GPI anchors are assembled and transferred to proteins destined for lipid modification in the ER. GPI-APs are known to undergo structural remodeling in the ER for efficient trafficking to the Golgi in vesicles that are distinct from those for other secretory proteins, already marking them for delivery to specialized sphingolipids- and cholesterols-enriched cell membrane microdomains (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fujita and Kinoshita, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kinoshita et al., 2013</a>). With its signal peptide, FER could be secreted by default to the cell membrane. That FER and LLG1 already interact in the ER (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) and this interaction underlies efficient FER localization to the cell membrane (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6, 7 and 10</a>) are consistent with at least a fraction of FER exiting the ER as a FER-LLG1/LRE complex (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). That FER and LLG1/LRE remain associated with the RAC/ROP signaling complex along the cell membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5, 9</a>) also provides additional support for FER-LLG1/LRE being transported from the ER to the cell membrane as a complex. In complexing with FER in the ER and \u2018chaperoning\u2019 its delivery to the cell membrane, LLG1 and LRE ensure delivery of FER to GPI-AP-destined micro membrane environments for its proper functional location and assembly of the RAC/ROP signaling apparatus (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). In the remaining part of the FER-ROPGEF-RAC/ROP signaling complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and being required for several RAC/ROP regulated processes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Duan et al., 2014</a>), LLG1 and LRE apparently also function as an integral component of the FER signal reception apparatus. They might directly participate in signal perception by FER and/or regulate how FER interacts with various possible binding targets, such as RALF1 or other hormones and cell wall carbohydrates. They also conceivably provide a landmark for the assembly of the FER signaling apparatus and regulation of its activity such as by maintaining its stability or inducing its recycling from the cell membrane, roles known to be played by GPI-APs (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fujita and Kinoshita, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yu et al., 2013</a>). To what extent the LRE family protein controls the delivery of receptor kinases as a class or more specifically those closely related to FER remains to be determined."

                                "text": "Results presented here also provide evidence for the notion that LLG1/LRE acts as a co-receptor to mediate at least those FER-regulated processes examined here. On the phenotypic level, growth and developmental defects in <i>llg1</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 2</a>) and reproductive defects in <i>lre</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Capron et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tsukamoto et al., 2010</a>) together span the spectrum of vegetative and reproductive phenotypes in <i>fer</i> mutants. The non-additive phenotype of <i>fer-4 llg1-2</i> double mutant relative to each of its parent single mutants (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) provides further support that FER and LLG1 function in and both are required for the same pathways. Biochemically, both LLG1 and LRE physically interact with FER on the cell membrane (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) and exist as components of the FER-ROPGEF-RAC/ROP-NADPH oxidase signaling pathway (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), consistent with their serving with FER as signal mediators on the cell surface to RAC/ROPs. This is further supported biologically by loss of LLG1 or LRE inducing the same signaling defects as in <i>fer</i> null mutants, including processes regulated by auxin, ABA, RALF1, and ROS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3, 4</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Duan et al., 2014</a>). Besides LLG1/LRE, RALF1 is thus far the only other molecule reported to interact with the FER extracellular domain, although the precise RALF1 target site on FER remains unknown (<a href=\"#bib23\">Haruta et al., 2014</a>). That RALF1 interacts with co-expressed FER and LLG1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>) and that both FER and LLG1 are needed to mediate RALF1 signaled responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>) indicate that the FER-LLG1 complex indeed has the capacity to serve as a co-receptor for this first known ligand of FER. Given the already known participation of FER in multiple hormone and defense signaling pathways, the FER-LLG1/LRE complex could equally be a surface co-regulator for multiple signals. Moreover, FER is also broadly speculated to interact with cell wall carbohydrates by virtue of its extracellular homology with the disaccharide-binding malectin (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kessler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cheung and Wu, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lindner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wolf and Hofte, 2014</a>). Therefore, the extracellular interactions engaged by FER are likely to be complex and influenced by multiple factors whose presence fluctuates depending on cellular and environmental conditions. The FER-LLG1/LRE partnership discovered here laid the ground work towards a more comprehensive understanding of how FER attains its multiple biological role; this will however require first deciphering other biochemical interactions maintained by FER."

The findings provide new insights into the mechanism of signaling by FER, and into the molecular functions of the LRE-related GPI-anchored proteins, which are poorly understood in plants. Overall the study appears be well-executed and the data are solid. Evidence for LLG1 functioning as a chaperone for FER delivery to the cell membrane is robust, but evidence for it functioning as a co-receptor for signal perception is weaker. Additionally, we think the manuscript can be improved (e.g., sentence structure, better explanation of the logic behind each experiment), as in many places it was difficult to follow or information was missing."

The proposed model is that LRE/LLG1 forms a tetrameric signaling complex with FER and inactive RAC/ROP proteins. The FER- LRE/LLG interactions are supported by yeast 2-hybrid as well as BIFC studies and are convincing that LLG1 is a chaperone for localization of FER to the PM. However, several experiments are needed to strengthen the conclusion about LLG1's role as a co-receptor: (A) FER-mediated molecular responses to RALF1, such as gene expression, should be analyzed in <i>fer</i> and <i>llg1</i> mutants (e.g. the TCH and BR6ox genes reported in Shih et al., and <a href=\"#bib23\">Haruta et al. 2014</a>). (B) Does RALF1 alter FER-LLG1 interaction, e.g. in the co-IP assays shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>? (C) Is RALF1 binding to FER affected in the <i>llg1</i> mutant (as assayed in <a href=\"#bib23\">Haruta et al., 2014</a>)? In other words, if LLG1 + FER bind RALF, but LRE + FER do not (based on the phenotypes of <i>llg1</i> and <i>lre</i>), that would be strong support of the model that FER selectivity is due to association with LRE-like proteins. As we understand it, the ROP2 pulldown was performed with LLG1 and LRE expressed in protoplasts (not <i>E. coli</i>), which should have the endogenous FER. Therefore, the likely explanation is that FER mediated the pulldown. But then this should be tested using the <i>fer</i> mutant and FER co-overexpression, and also in the presence and absence of RALF1 peptide. That is, <i>fer</i> mutant protoplasts transformed with (1) LLG1-HA, (2) LLG1-HA + 35S-FER, and (3) LLG1-HA+35S-FER + RALF1 treatment. These three samples can potentially answer several key questions raised by their model. Furthermore, whether LLG1 function is required for the FER-ROP2 interaction can be tested by doing the ROP2-pulldown-FER assay in <i>llg1</i> mutant protoplasts. Their model (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>) proposes the \u201csignal\u201d (somehow) causes RACROP disassociation from the receptor complex and could be tested by including RALF1 in their ROP pulldown assays.

Furthermore, the ratios of FER in the FA vs. outside the FA in the synergids are estimated based on integrating the GFP signal over a ROI. It is not clear how the ROIs were selected, because the outline of the synergids is not clear. The ROIs for the mutants seem larger, especially in the case of the <i>lre llg1</i> double mutant. This might result in an artificially high value for the signal outside the FA in the mutant gametophytes.

If one examines Haruta et al. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, mock-treated <i>fer-4</i> roots were shorter than wild type ones (compare first and second data sets in the plot). The seedling image in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, one of the <i>fer-4</i> seedlings was longer, the other was shorter or at most comparable to wild type, suggesting that the illustrated images were likely among the longer population of <i>fer-4,</i> which are routinely the better survivors. As for the Shih et al. study, the main text and SI together showed two partial <i>fer-4</i> root images (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, and S2E). The more severely growth-retarded seedlings also have strong cell wall defects, including rips between cells (D. Kita, Ph.D. dissertation, and manuscript under preparation) and, in our opinion, would not have been good candidates for assessment of mechanical sensing. Judging from the notable root hairs still observable in <i>fer-4</i> in Shih et al. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, plants used in the mechanical sensing studies would indeed have been the larger-sized seedlings, possibly approximating wild type. However, the overall plant sizes in Shih et al. could not be evaluated from the results shown in the paper."
