Although these protein gradients are now emerging as significant general motifs to spatially organize cells, little is known about how protein patterns are established by local unmixing, and maintained on a molecular level.

To systematically investigate the mutual dependence between biochemical networks and three-dimensional cellular organization several techniques to confine proteins in micro compartments have recently been devised. One approach to achieve three-dimensional confinement of proteins and cytoplasmic extracts is by their encapsulation in water-oil droplets or vesicles. (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pinot et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Good et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hazel et al., 2013</a>) These systems add tremendously to our understanding of how a constrained reaction space, and varying surface-to-volume ratios affect (bio) chemical reactions. Applying subtle mechanical forces to these systems, they may be also deformed into non-spherical shapes. However, if more complex geometries need to be realized, or if the compartments need to be mechanically stabilized, biochemical systems may also be reconstituted on and in spatially tailored microfabricated environments (<a href=\"#bib13\">Garner et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Laan et al., 2012</a>). In particular, combinations of two- and three-dimensionally engineered substrates with lipid membranes have been applied to study the role of simple membrane geometries on membrane interacting protein networks in vitro (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schweizer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zieske and Schwille, 2013</a>). However, although such in vitro experiments are now being successfully applied to identify the minimal components and interactions of protein networks, we are still far from understanding the mutual interdependence of protein functionalities and physical parameters in generating nonhomogeneous protein distributions for providing positional information within the cellular compartment. Therefore, further development of bottom-up approaches are required to tackle the minimal requirements for nonhomogeneous protein localization. Studying gradient formation in a simplified and controlled environment, detached from the complexity of living cells, should shed light on the role of individual biochemical and physical parameters for regulated protein localization in space and time."

In many bacteria, and also in eukaryotes that undergo symmetric division, protein gradients with the lowest concentration in the middle of the cell and the highest concentration at the cell poles have been identified. These gradients target the division site through polar inhibition of the division machinery assembly. For instance, in fission yeast, a Pom1 gradient regulates the onset of mitosis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Celton-Morizur et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Padte et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Moseley et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, in many bacteria, the assembly of the conserved ring-forming cell division protein FtsZ is inhibited at the cell poles by protein gradients of FtsZ inhibitors. In <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>, a gradient of the cytokinesis inhibiting protein MipZ is established, (<a href=\"#bib46\">Thanbichler and Shapiro, 2006</a>) whereas in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, an inhibitory complex of MinC and MinD is attached to the cell poles by MinJ and DivIVA.

(<a href=\"#bib26\">Lutkenhaus, 2007</a>) Interestingly however, MinC and MinD in <i>E.coli</i> do not form a static gradient, but the Min protein patterns oscillate from pole to pole. (<a href=\"#bib39\">Raskin and de Boer, 1999b</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Raskin and de Boer, 1999a</a>) These dynamic oscillations require ATP as an energy source for the ATPase MinD and MinE, which accelerates hydrolysis of ATP by MinD. (<a href=\"#bib8\">de Boer et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hu and Lutkenhaus, 2001</a>) On time-average, the oscillations result in an effective concentration gradient of the MinC/MinD complex."

Labeling MinE and co-reconstituting MinE with MinD in cell-shaped compartments, we demonstrated that pole-to-pole oscillations of the Min system can be reconstituted in vitro (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zieske and Schwille, 2013</a>).

On the other hand, protein gradients should be robust against morphological changes during cell development and growth. Living bacteria typically double their length during one live cycle and gradually constrict during cell division. Thus, they undergo significant changes in cell geometry, which should not disturb the establishment and functional role of Min protein gradients. Whether cell shape affects pattern formation only if the geometry of a cell is artificially perturbed, or whether a cell might use its own geometry as a readout and control parameter to shape protein gradients, still has to be determined. Thus, the identification of principal cues for gradient establishment, and their modification by spatial parameters, such as the three-dimensional geometry of a cell, remains an outstanding challenge."

In particular, FtsZ, which marks the cell division site and represents the cytoskeletal backbone for the divisome machinery in many bacteria, can be targeted to the middle of a cell-like compartment by a gradient of Min proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that orientation and partitioning of Min protein gradients is controlled by compartment geometry. Notably, our synthetic system opens a new way to study complex organization principles in a simplified environment and provides novel insights into the basic biophysical and biochemical requirements for gradient formation."

Supported lipid membranes, which adapt to the topography of the underlying PDMS support, were produced using a vesicle fusion technique. Then proteins, ATP and/or GTP (depending on experiment) of defined concentration were added to a buffer volume of 200 \u00b5l on top of the supported lipid membranes. At this step of the protocol dynamic Min patterns formed on top of the membrane. These patterns did not oscillate but formed travelling waves. A Confocal image of Min waves on the upper level of the membrane support is shown in (<b>C</b>). Yellow: eGFP-MinD, red: MinE.Atto655. (<b>D</b>) Subsequently the buffer reservoir was manually reduced using a pipette, such that the buffer remained only in the micro fabricated chambers. Due to the confinement in small sample volumes with cell shaped geometry, the Min protein patterns oscillated within these chambers. The top of the chambers was open with a buffer/air interface. To limit evaporation of the buffer a lid was placed on top of the plastic ring. The upper level of the PDMS supports (outside of the compartments) was dry and residual biomolecules, such as remaining lipids and Min proteins were immobile, as determined by FRAP experiments."

However, both the compartments and the spatial scales of the protein waves are about ten times bigger as compared to living cells. Why the Min patterns in vivo are about ten times larger than in vitro is quantitatively not fully understood. Different protein ratios, ionic strength of the buffer and membrane composition have been shown to affect the spatial scales (<a href=\"#bib25\">Loose et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore the membrane potential (<a href=\"#bib45\">Strahl and Hamoen, 2010</a>) and molecular crowding in a living cell could influence Min protein patterns. An advantage of the larger spatial scales in vitro is the possibility to study with much greater detail how the concentration profiles of MinD and MinE, which result in the formation of MinD gradients, are modulated during an oscillation period. Following the MinD and MinE concentration profiles along the compartment length over time, we found that the dynamic profiles are characterized by the following succession of events: First, attachment and increase in concentration of MinD at one site of the compartment, then delayed attachment of MinE to MinD and increase in MinE intensity at the trail of MinD (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Although the size of bacterial cells and photo bleaching is limiting for characterizing the Min profiles in vivo in such detail as it is possible in vitro, the intensity peak of MinE at the trail of the Min pattern was also observed in <i>E. coli</i> and is generally referred to as \u2018MinE ring\u2019. (<a href=\"#bib40\">Raskin and de Boer, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fu et al., 2001</a>) After formation of the MinE peak MinD/E were disassembled from the membrane at the trail of the MinD zone, which was accompanied by assembly of a new MinD/E zone at the other pole of the compartment (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This disassembly of Min protein patterns at the trailing zone during each oscillation is comparable to the disassembly at the trailing edge of travelling Min patterns on flat membranes. The main difference of Min proteins profiles on flat membranes and in microcompartments is that the concentration profiles on flat membranes only change their localization while traveling across the membrane. In contrast, during oscillations in compartments new membrane attached Min protein patterns need to be repeatedly established and disassembled every half oscillation period, which results in a remarkable remodelling of the concentration profiles during the oscillation cycle and an asymmetry in their rise and decay phases at the poles."

Remarkably, MinD formed indeed a clear nonhomogeneous concentration profile, with the lowest concentration in the middle of the compartment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Thus, we conclude that using the Min system, the establishment of an effective protein gradient indeed requires only a lipid membrane, an appropriate reaction space, and two proteins that self-organize under the consumption of energy, in the form of ATP."

Although MinD has been shown to interact with membranes in vitro and MinE interacts with MinD (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hu et al., 2002</a>), MinE also harbours a short membrane targeting sequence at its N-terminus (<a href=\"#bib33\">Park et al., 2011</a>). Mutations in the membrane targeting domain of MinE result in defects in cell division and in distinct phenotypes, such as filamentous cells or a minicelling phenotype, respectively (<a href=\"#bib33\">Park et al., 2011</a>). However how the membrane targeting of MinE contributes to a normally functioning Min system is not fully understood. To gain a deeper insight in how the membrane targeting sequence of MinE contributes to gradient formation of the Min system we purified and labelled a MinE mutant without its membrane targeting sequence (MinE without amino acids three to eight, herein referred to as MinE(\u03943\u20138)) and reconstituted it with MinD in microcompartments. Interestingly, MinE(\u03943\u20138) resulted in a severe phenotype in the bottom-up system. The Min system was still able to self-organize into dynamic pattern, but instead of a stable pole-to-pole oscillation, the Min system formed dynamic patches with irregular shape and without a constant axis of movement (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Thus, although MinE(\u03943\u20138) still counteracted MinD, no stable MinD gradients were generated. Depending on the degree of affecting the membrane targeting sequence of MinE, the effective generation of a gradient and its localization along the long axis of the cell might therefore be altered to different degrees, which might account for the distinct phenotypes in vivo, such as filamentous cells or mini cells."

To investigate the spatial distribution of eGFP-MinC in our minimal system, we co-reconstituted MinD and MinE oscillations with MinC in micro compartments. We found that eGFP-MinC oscillated from pole-to-pole by coupling to MinD/E patterns, which strongly resembles the dynamics of MinC in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Based on time-lapse movies, we then analyzed the time-averaged distribution of eGFP-MinC and found the concentration profile of MinC also exhibit a pronounced minimum in the middle of the compartment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This experiment revealed that the effective non-equilibrium distribution of the complete Min system, with the highest concentration of MinC at the cell poles, is fully recapitulated,in our simple cell-free setting."

Recently it has been shown that a minimal lipid bilayer for pattern Min formation on flat supports only requires two different lipids. Moreover, cardiolipin, which has previously been proposed as a structural polar cue, which might help in triggering the pole to-pole oscillations of Min proteins, was not required for Min pattern formation on planar supports. Instead, the negative charge has been suggested to play a primary role in formation of surface waves on planar membranes. (<a href=\"#bib48\">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</a>) To address whether membrane charge and not the chemical membrane composition is also sufficient for gradient forming pole-to-pole oscillations, we established the minimal membrane composition for Min protein oscillations in our synthetic system. First, we confirmed the aforementioned results that membrane charge is a strong determinant for Min pattern formation on flat supported membranes (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013D</a>). Then we reconstituted the Min proteins in compartments with two different minimal membrane mixtures: First, with 70% neutrally charged DOPC and 30% negatively charged cardiolipin, and then with 70% DOPC and 30% negatively charged PG. In both cases, the proteins retained their ability of pattern formation and pole-to-pole oscillations (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4E</a>). Thus, we conclude that Min gradients can be established without any structural cues in the membrane. In contrast, simple physical parameters, such as electrostatic interactions between the membrane and the proteins, are strong determinants for gradient formation. For high amounts of negatively charged lipids, the length scales of the protein patterns decrease (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a> and [<a href=\"#bib48\">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</a>]). Thus, the spatial scales of the Min proteins on highly negatively charged membranes would be too small to form stable pole-to-pole oscillations in compartments, which were engineered for protein length scales on <i>E.coli</i> membranes. The implication that Min protein oscillations are perturbed if the membrane charge increases is in agreement with live cell studies of GFP-MinD in PE-lacking <i>E.coli</i> cells, which demonstrate that Min protein pattern are affected if the membrane charge is increased (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mileykovskaya et al., 2003</a>) and provides further evidence that a balanced ratio of charged and non-charged lipids is of critical importance for the live cycle of <i>E.coli</i>."

However, although protein gradients are now emerging as general motives to organize cells, tools to study gradient-mediated organization of three-dimensional space are limited. To directly investigate whether the established Min gradient indeed provides an efficient cue to position downstream targets, we attempted the assembly and positioning of FtsZ to the middle of a synthetic compartment in a co-reconstitution assay. To keep the system as minimal as possible, we avoided the native membrane adaptors of FtsZ, FtsA and ZipA, and used a FtsZ hybrid protein, fused to YFP and a membrane targeting sequence (FtsZ-mts) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Osawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arumugam et al., 2014</a>). In spite of this simplification, we found that highly FtsZ-mts enriched regions were clearly visible in the center of the compartments, while FtsZ-mts localization was strongly reduced at the polar regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Negative controls with FtsZ-mts bundles on flat supported bilayers confirmed that all thee Min proteins are required to deplete FtsZ-mts from the membrane (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arumugam et al., 2014</a>). This unequivocally demonstrates that an effective time-averaged protein gradient can indeed regulate the localization of down-stream targets to predefined localizations, such as the middle of a compartment."

MinC has a C-terminal and an N-terminal domain, (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hu and Lutkenhaus, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cordell et al., 2001</a>) which are both involved in FtsZ inhibition. The C-terminal domain of MinC is responsible for binding to MinD and dimerization of MinC. Furthermore, it binds to the conserved C-terminus of FtsZ and was suggested to compete with FtsA and ZipA to inhibit FtsZ ring formation. (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hu and Lutkenhaus, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Shen and Lutkenhaus, 2009</a>). Note, that FtsZ-mts comprises amino acids 1\u2013366 of <i>E. coli</i> FtsZ, but instead of the C-terminally conserved tail, it comprises YFP and a membrane targeting sequence. The proposed interference of the C-terminal domain with FtsZ is therefore not involved in the system described above, which suggest that the inhibitory activity of the C-terminal domain is not required in a minimal system to inhibit FtsZ at compartment poles. In the context of a living cell, the inhibitory activity of the C-terminal domain of MinC might provide an additional mechanism for disrupting FtsZ, rendering the Min system more robust."

Since the FtsZ-binding region for the C-terminal domain of MinC is not present in FtsZ-mts, the major inhibitory activity contributing to FtsZ-inhibition in our synthetic system should originate from the N-terminal domain of MinC. To test this hypothesis, we used a MinC mutant (MinC-G10D) with lower inhibitory activity of its N-terminal domain (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hu et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Shen and Lutkenhaus, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2010</a>). The MinC-G10D mutant has reduced ability to inhibit FtsZ in vivo and in vitro, but interacts with MinD (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hu et al., 1999</a>). We first characterized MinC-G10D by co-reconstituting it at different concentrations with FtsZ-mts, MinD and fluorescently labeled MinE on flat supported membranes. Consistent with the behavior of wild type MinC, we found that the self-organizing Min protein patterns were unperturbed at low concentrations of MinC-G10D, and that the Min patterns were weakened by high concentrations of MinC-G10D (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The weakening of Min patterns for high concentrations of MinC is likely due to an overlap of the binding sites for MinC and MinE on MinD (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ma et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wu et al., 2011</a>), which might result in a competition of MinC with MinE for binding sites on MinD at large MinC concentrations. The weakening of Min Protein patterns therefore suggests that MinC-G10D binds to MinD. However, in contrast to MinC the MinC-G10D mutant was inefficient in depolymerizing FtsZ-mts on flat membranes, as well as at the poles, when co-reconstituted in microcompartments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These observations confirm that the inhibitory activity in the synthetic system originates from the N-terminal domain of MinC and that the inhibitory activity of the N-terminal domain is sufficient to inhibit FtsZ-polymerization at compartment poles in the context of a minimal system."

However, the mode of pole-to-pole oscillations should be stable over a substantial variation in length. As cells grow and double their length before division, stable pole-to-pole oscillations of the Min proteins need to be established over a spatial range of at least two times the length of the daughter cells. We therefore hypothesized that stable pole-to-pole oscillations should be found in microstructures of different length, where the range should vary at least by a factor of two, if this length-dependent robustness is intrinsic to the Min system. To test this hypothesis, we reconstituted the oscillations of MinD and MinE in micro-compartments of systematically varying length from 12 \u00b5m to 245 \u00b5m and investigated the stability of Min patterns at different compartment lengths. In compartments with a constant width of 10 \u00b5m, the Min system oscillated along the long axis of the compartments (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zieske and Schwille, 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). We observed oscillations with multiple minima and maxima in long compartments, and found that every oscillation mode occurred at a defined range of the compartment length (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In most of the short compartments with an aspect ratio (length to width) below 4.5, we observed pole-to-pole oscillations, in rare cases they prevailed up to aspect ratios of 5.5."

Thus, oscillation periods between less than a minute and 4 min were measured.

To overcome these problems and to better characterize the dependence on compartment length, we acquired time-lapse movies, capturing numerous compartments simultaneously. Then, we compared Min oscillations in micro compartments with different aspect ratios up to 5.5, which were acquired at the same time on the same chip. Imaging multiple compartments on the same chip allowed us to analyse Min oscillations in about 200 compartments under the same experimental conditions at the same time. We found that the oscillation period between aspect ratios of 1.5 and 5.5 increased from 79 s to about 165 s. For higher aspect ratios we only observed higher oscillation modes.

Tools to answer this question for the chosen system in vivo are limited, because in living <i>E.coli</i> bacteria it is challenging to systematically modify the width of a cell. Thus, it is unknown whether the constant diameter of cells plays a significant role as a geometric cue for septum positioning. Compared to living cells, our in vitro system is much more flexible in pre-setting a defined geometry and reaction volume, enabling us to address for the first time the role of cell width for Min gradient formation and thus, as a geometrical cue for cell organization. In compartments with a small width of 10 \u00b5m, only oscillations along the long axis were supported (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Interestingly however, larger widths also resulted in oscillations along the short axis of a compartment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>).

In live cells it is challenging to directly observe the partitioning of proteins, because the constricting septum of <i>E. coli</i> becomes smaller than the optical resolution limit during the proposed process. At the same time, the Min protein system is a highly dynamic system, rendering time-lapse imaging with current superresolution techniques difficult. To experimentally test the proposed partitioning of Min proteins during septum constriction, compartments that mimicked morphologically different stages of bacterial cell division were designed. Using cell-shaped compartments with a systematically varying width of the artificial septum, we analyzed whether different patterns occurred in more \u2018constricted\u2019 compartments, as compared to \u2018non-constricted\u2019 compartments."

We demonstrated that a switch from asymmetric pole-to-pole oscillations to symmetric double oscillations occurred at a certain cell length. However, in longer compartments, double oscillations occurred already in unconstricted cells und thus, a constriction in the middle of the cell had no additional effect on pattern formation. In very short cells, on the other hand, a constriction in the middle of the compartment resulted in a new length axis of the two compartments perpendicular to the length axis of the unconstricted \u2018mother\u2019 compartment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Thus, a re-orientation of the pattern occurred during constriction, from oscillations along the long axis in the unconstricted compartment, to perpendicular new length axes.

In addition, the Min partitioning to both daughter cells can be controlled by changing the local compartment width during septum closure in the middle of the cell."

Applying this system, we particularly tackled three major questions. First, what are the minimal requirements for protein gradient formation?

This cell-free bottom-up system recapitulated remarkably cell-like properties, such as coordinated spatial coordinated localization of FtsZ-mts to the middle of a cell-like compartment. Interestingly, although it is proposed that MinC has two inhibitory domains which act on FtsZ\u2013FtsZ interactions and on the ternary system FtsZ-FtsA/ZipA, respectively (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shen and Lutkenhaus, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2010</a>), our data suggest that MinC can already inhibit FtsZ-localization at compartment poles by only disrupting FtsZ\u2013FtsZ interactions. While we do not exclude that the interaction of MinC with the conserved C-terminal domain, which interacts with FtsA and ZipA, is a parallel mechanism to inhibit FtsZ polymerization at cell poles and possibly make FtsZ structures more sensitive to the action of the Min system, our results show that the minimal biochemical requirements to displace FtsZ from compartment poles by the Min system do not involve the disruption of FtsZ-membrane binding sites."

The chrome mask was purchased from Compugraphics Jena GmbH. To better mimic the curvature of the cellular membrane, we left a small gap between photoresist and mask during exposure of the mask to UV light, resulting in more tilted walls as compared to the contact mode. For reconstitution of Min protein oscillations along the length axis of a compartment, the mask patterns had a width of 10 \u00b5m. The Si wafers were coated with chlorotrimethylsilane (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to prevent sticking of PDMS to the wafer. PDMS (Sylgard184, Dow Corning, Midland, MI) was mixed at a ratio (monomer to cross-linker) of 10:1 and degased under vacuum. The PDMS mixture was then poured on top of the wafer. Standard glass coverslides where then manually pressed into the liquid PDMS on top of the wafer, leaving a PDMS layer of about 30 \u00b5m between the wafer and the glass coverslide. After curing the PDMS at 80\u00b0C overnight, the bulk PDMS layer was peeled off. With the help of a razor blade, the glass coverslide with the about 30 \u00b5m thin, micro structured PDMS layer was carefully separated from the wafer and used as sample support (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The microstructured PDMS/glass devices were stored at room temperature until further use. Before the microstructured PDMS was used as a membrane support, it was sonicated for 5 min in ethanol, washed with water, air dried, and treated with air plasma."

The profiles of the micro compartments can be designed with a flat bottom or a tapered bottom (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The Min protein oscillations and Min gradient formation were supported by both profiles. However, the image quality was better when the bottom of the compartments was flat. The advantage of a tapered bottom was that these structures allowed FtsZ-mts to align perpendicularly to the length axis of the compartments (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Thus, all compartments containing FtsZ-mts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2,3,5</a>) had a tapered bottom. To keep the boundary conditions comparable, the MinCDE oscillations and gradients in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> were reconstituted in tapered compartments as well."

The width at the unconstricted region was about 12 \u00b5m at the top and 10 \u00b5m at the bottom of the compartments. The septal region of compartments, in which the switch of the oscillation modes occurred, had a width of about 2 \u00b5m at the top. The resolution limit in z-direction and the tilted PDMS-surface through which the laser beam had to pass, render an exact description of the profile at the septum challenging, However a confocal x/z-scan of the septum is depicted in <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>. Also note that a meniscus due to the surface tension of the buffer might render the actual cross-sectional area of the buffer smaller than the profile of the structure suggests."

Afterwards the buffer above the microstructures was removed by pipetting. Restricted to a small buffer compartments within the micro structures the Min protein patterns start to oscillate in cell-shaped geometries. To limit evaporation a lid was placed on top of the plastic ring surrounding numerous microstructures.

Their proposed reaction-diffusion model has provided insight into the mechanism, and they have explored the system in several subsequent papers. In 2013 Zieske and Schwille described creation of cylindrical PDMS chambers coated with lipid, in which the also reconstituted the MinD/E.

This is an important advance, which I think merits publication. I do have a couple of general issues that I think need to be addressed. Also, I found the paper to be lacking a surprising number of essential experimental details, which marred the presentation and made understanding difficult.

Yet in the 10 \u00b5m chambers here they appear nicely aligned. Also, from the Schweizer study one can conclude that the direction of oscillation was established by width and length of flat lipid patches, so the curvature of the present chambers is probably not playing a role in the present oscillations. These two points should be addressed briefly."

My confusion is what goes on top? Is there a cover slip? In this case the profile is a half circle with a flat top. The Methods have a somewhat obscure statement \u201cthe cured bulk PDMS was carefully peeled off and then the glass cover slide with an about 30 \u03bcm high microstructured PDMS layer were peeled off with the help of a razor blade.\u201d (The two peeled are confusing.) That sounds like the PDMS is separated, but I would imagine it has to be sealed again with a cover slip. Is the cover slip separately coated with lipid? And then finally sealed? In the caption to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> the statement means nothing to me: \u201cThe buffer was not yet reduced to a level below the upper level of the chip. Therefore membrane and FtsZ-mts network are still intact on the upper level of the chip.\u201d The Zieske ref provides a clue. It suggests that the PDMS chambers are simply open on top, no cover slip. A liquid-air interface. This needs more detailed description, including when and how the liquid was lowered (this for each figure). If the setup is like Zieske, I think a diagram like that 1b should be added, and perhaps also a cross section of the chamber (indicating its hemicircular shape, if that is reasonably established."

In this follow up paper the authors exploit the system developed in the 2013 paper to show that the Min proteins can position FtsZ within micro compartments that have the shape of a cell. This positioning of FtsZ in these micro compartments is another step in the bottom up approach to reconstitute bacterial cell division. It is a nice demonstration although it is predictable based upon there prior two publications. It would be improved if the authors characterized the MinC contribution to FtsZ localization in more detail to confirm the effect of MinC."
