The heterodimer structure was divided into domains to obtain a good fit to the cryoEM density. Differences in the T = 4 quasi-equivalent heterodimer components show their adaptation to different environments. The spikes on the icosahedral 3-fold axes and those in general positions are significantly different, possibly representing different phases during initial generation of fusogenic E1 trimers. CryoEM maps of neutralizing Fab fragments complexed with VLPs have been interpreted using the crystal structures of the Fab fragments and the VLP structure. Based on these analyses the CHK-152 antibody was shown to stabilize the viral surface, hindering the exposure of the fusion-loop, likely neutralizing infection by blocking fusion. The CHK-9, m10 and m242 antibodies surround the receptor-attachment site, probably inhibiting infection by blocking cell attachment."

The heterodimer structure was divided into domains to obtain a good fit to the cryoEM density. Differences in the T = 4 quasi-equivalent heterodimer components show their adaptation to different environments. The spikes on the icosahedral 3-fold axes and those in general positions are significantly different, possibly representing different phases during initial generation of fusogenic E1 trimers. CryoEM maps of neutralizing Fab fragments complexed with VLPs have been interpreted using the crystal structures of the Fab fragments and the VLP structure. Based on these analyses the CHK-152 antibody was shown to stabilize the viral surface, hindering the exposure of the fusion-loop, likely neutralizing infection by blocking fusion. The CHK-9, m10 and m242 antibodies surround the receptor-attachment site, probably inhibiting infection by blocking cell attachment."

The first reported human CHIKV infections occurred in East Africa in 1952 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Robinson, 1955</a>). Prior to the 2005 epidemic on R\u00e9union Island, CHIKV was not regarded as a highly prevalent virus. An adaptive mutation in the E1 protein (E1-A226V) that allowed CHIKV to replicate more efficiently in <i>Aedes albopictus</i> is considered to be the primary reason for its recent extensive spread, infecting millions of individuals in Africa and Asia (<a href=\"#bib76\">Tsetsarkin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kumar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Santhosh et al., 2008</a>). In some CHIKV-infected patients, severe damage in joint tissues can cause debilitating chronic arthritis. In the recent outbreaks, a change in pathogenesis was observed, with some cases progressing to fatal encephalitis. An autochthonous CHIKV outbreak in Italy in 2007 and the presence of the <i>Aedes albopictus</i> vector in many areas of Europe and the Americas have raised concern of further spread of the virus. Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral agent approved for use in humans."

Alphaviruses are a group of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, enveloped viruses transmitted by arthropods (<a href=\"#bib19\">Griffin, 2007</a>). The alphavirus genome encodes four non-structural and five structural proteins. The non-structural proteins are required for virus replication, protein modification, and immune antagonism. The structural proteins (capsid-E3-E2-6K-E1) are synthesized as a polyprotein from a subgenomic promoter, and are cleaved post-translationally into separate proteins by an autoproteinase and signalase. The E1 glycoprotein participates in cell fusion (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lescar et al., 2001</a>), whereas the E2 glycoprotein binds to cellular receptors (<a href=\"#bib66\">Smith et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>) and initiates clathrin-dependent endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib67\">Solignat et al., 2009</a>). Virus core assembly is initiated by interactions between the genomic RNA and the nuclear capsid protein (NCP) (<a href=\"#bib71\">Tellinghuisen et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Tellinghuisen and Kuhn, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Linger et al., 2004</a>) in the cytoplasm. The E3 protein is essential for the proper folding of p62, the precursor to E2, and the formation of the p62-E1 heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mulvey and Brown, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Carleton et al., 1997</a>). Although E3 remains part of mature Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), apparently, it is not a component of mature CHIKV (<a href=\"#bib63\">Simizu et al., 1984</a>). The small 6 kDa protein, 6K, associates with the p62-E1 heterodimer and is transported to the plasma membrane prior to assembly. The 6K protein facilitates particle morphogenesis but is not stoichiometrically incorporated into virions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gaedigk-Nitschko and Schlesinger, 1990</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">1991</a>)."

The ectodomain forms 80 spikes, each consisting of three copies of E1-E2 heterodimers. There are 20 icosahedral \u201ci3\u201d spikes, situated on icosahedral 3-fold axes, and 60 quasi-3-fold \u201cq3\u201d spikes in general positions containing a quasi-3-fold axis consistent with T = 4 symmetry (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Thus, each icosahedral asymmetric unit contains one complete q3 spike and one-third of an i3 spike. E1 of CHIKV is a 439 amino acid protein with an N-linked glycosylation site at residue Asn141. The ectodomain is formed by the 404 N-terminal residues, followed by a 30 residue transmembrane (TM) helix and a five amino acid cytoplasmic domain. The E1 ectodomain consists of three \u03b2-barrel domains (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lescar et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gibbons et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Voss et al., 2010</a>). Domain I is spatially located between domains II and III with the fusion peptide lying at the distal end of domain II. E2 of CHIKV is 423 amino acids in length and has two N-linked glycans at positions Asn263 and Asn345. The E2 364 residue ectodomain is followed by a 26-residue TM helix and a 33-residue cytoplasmic domain. The E2 ectodomain consists of three distinct immunoglobulin-fold domains with domain A, the putative receptor-binding domain, lying between domains B and C (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Voss et al., 2010</a>). In the mature virus, domain B covers the fusion loop in domain II of E1. The virus becomes fusogenic in acid pH (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wahlberg and Garoff, 1992</a>) when sets of three E1 molecules combine to make a fusogenic trimer after expelling the three E2 proteins from the center of the spike. The three fusion loops are then exposed outwards for insertion into the host cell membrane (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gibbons et al., 2004</a>). Similar large conformational changes occur in other enveloped viruses (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kielian and Rey, 2006</a>) although little is known of the structural intermediates through which these changes take place."

The N-terminal 118 amino acids of Sindbis (SINV) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Choi et al., 1991</a>) and SFV (<a href=\"#bib8\">Choi et al., 1997</a>) nuclear capsid contain positively charged residues that associate with the genomic RNA (<a href=\"#bib87\">Zhang et al., 2002</a>). A similar positively charged N-terminal region exists in CHIKV NCP and functions to recognize the viral genome for packaging during NCP assembly (<a href=\"#bib50\">Perera et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hong et al., 2006</a>). The carboxy-terminal region of the NCP has a chymotrypsin-like fold and acts as an auto-catalytic proteinase during processing of the structural polyprotein (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hahn and Strauss, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Choi et al., 1991</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">1997</a>).

Non-human primates immunized with these VLPs developed high-titer neutralizing antibodies that protected against viremia after high-dose challenges. Moreover, immunodeficient mice that were passively administered purified IgG from immunized non-human primates were protected against CHIKV challenge (<a href=\"#bib11\">Couderc et al., 2009</a>). Previously, we published the structure of the CHIK VLPs at a resolution of 18 \u00c5 using cryoEM reconstruction of single particles (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akahata et al., 2010</a>). Here, we report a 5.3 \u00c5 three-dimensional high-resolution reconstruction of the CHIK VLP. We also describe pseudo-atomic resolution structures of CHIK VLPs complexed with Fab fragments from four different neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAb CHK-9, CHK-152, m10 and m242). These studies are the first structural investigations of CHIKV complexed with neutralizing MAbs, based on 15 \u00c5 resolution cryoEM reconstructions of the complexes, the 5.3 \u00c5 resolution structure of the VLPs and 3 \u00c5 resolution crystallographic studies of the Fab fragments. These structures suggest that MAb CHK-152 neutralizes infectivity by inhibiting fusion whereas the other MAbs probably neutralize by blocking attachment."

Subsequently, the number of refinable parameters was increased by breaking the structure into domains, based on the assumption that the domains likely are more rigid than the hinges in the polypeptide chain that hold the domains together. In addition, constraints imposed by the assumption of strict T = 4 symmetry were abandoned, thus further multiplying the number of refinable parameters by four. Verification came from the improved correlation of the domain-fitted structure with the amino acid sequences, the improved correlation between density heights of quasi-equivalent parts of the structure with each other, and from the emergence of features such as the position of the N-linked carbohydrate moieties."

The crystal structure of CHIKV E1-E2 (<a href=\"#bib80\">Voss et al., 2010</a>) was fitted into the 5.3 \u00c5 cryoEM map using the program EMfit to maximize the average value of the density (sumf) at all atomic positions (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1A</a>), to minimize the steric clash between symmetry related structures, and to minimize the percentage of atoms in low density (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rossmann et al., 2001</a>). Initially, the E1-E2 heterodimer crystal structure was fitted as a rigid body generating the four quasi-equivalent structures at positions #1, #2, #3, and #4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) while refining the best positions of the quasi-symmetry axes (see Materials and Methods), and using the icosahedral symmetry to generate the structure in neighboring icosahedral asymmetric units. The resultant locations of the four quasi-equivalent CHIKV heterodimers were used as starting positions for refinement of individual domains. The average height of the density at all fitted atoms (sumf) improved by \u223c12% for the independently fitted domains. The value of sumf was at least 38% lower for the B domains than for any of the other domains. This is consistent with the disorder of the B domain in the crystal structure of the SINV spike (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2010</a>) and the large temperature factors for the atoms in the B domain in the crystal structure of the CHIKV heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib80\">Voss et al., 2010</a>). The height of the average value of the cryoEM density taken over all atomic positions within a molecular domain was higher at the quasi-equivalent position #4 than at the other three quasi-equivalent positions (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1A</a>)<b>.</b> This might be due to crowding around the 5-fold symmetry axes, which reduces the variability in the heterodimer position."

This showed that the structures of the four quasi-equivalent parts of the model were more alike to each other than to the crystal structure of the CHIKV heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib80\">Voss et al., 2010</a>). As such similarity is unlikely to occur by accident, this observation helped to confirm the validity of the process used to interpret the cryoEM map. The systematic change of the E1-E2 heterodimers in the VLPs compared to the crystal structure is the result of accommodating the different quasi-equivalent environments. In contrast to the results for the related alphavirus, VEEV (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>), the presence of differences larger than the standard deviation between equivalenced C\u03b1 atoms between the four quasi-equivalent structural components of the CHIKV VLPs explains why averaging of the quasi equivalent density did not improve the map."

The remaining densities should correspond to the sugar moieties on E1 and E2 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pletnev et al., 2001</a>). The shape and size of the carbohydrate moiety for each of the three N-linked glycosylation sites is consistent in each of the four quasi-equivalent positions. The average volume of the carbohydrates at the four E1 (Asn141) sites in DI of E1 is 258 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> with an average height of 2.2 \u03c3, with most of the noise density not being greater than 1.0 \u03c3. This would correspond to about one sugar moiety. The densities corresponding to the four quasi-equivalent E2 (Asn263) sites in the E2 connecting ribbon were somewhat fragmented, making it difficult to determine their volumes. However, at lower (15 and 10 \u00c5) resolution, the densities were well defined. The volume of the density and average height associated with the four quasi-equivalent sites at E2 (Asn345) in domain C of E2 were as large as the sites at E1 (Asn141), but because of their proximity to the viral membrane, their boundaries were uncertain. The centers of the carbohydrate moieties were \u223c6 \u00c5 from the N atom of the glycosylated Asn residues."

Nevertheless, the q3 spike had apparent, although not exact, 3-fold symmetry within itself and with its surroundings. A comparison of the i3 and q3 structures showed that the E1 molecules wrap around the central E2 molecules more tightly in the i3 spike as indicated by the increased number of interactions between the E2 molecules in the i3 spike compared to the q3 spike. Thus, the i3 trimers in the VLPs were more compact with a greater number of interactions between its component molecules than the q3 trimer. The greater compactness of the i3 spike was confirmed by determining the radius of gyration of the i3 and the q3 spikes as a function of the radial distance from the viral center (Materials and Methods). At the base of the spike, where the E1 molecules make contacts between spikes, the radius of gyration was up to 5.8 \u00c5 less for the i3 spike than for the q3 spike (<a href=\"#tbl7\">Table 7</a>). At the top of the spike, the i3 and q3 spikes showed less difference. In addition, the whole of the q3 spike was translated away from the center of the VLPs by \u223c1.8 \u00c5. Thus, in comparison with the 20 i3 spikes, the 60 q3 spikes may be poised to release the E2 molecules from the center of the spikes in preparation for the formation of the E1 fusogenic homotrimers early in the infection (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2010</a>)."

Of these, the amino acid sequence of the NCP of SFV has greater similarity to CHIKV. Therefore, a homology model for CHIKV NCP (residues 119 to 267) was generated based on the crystal structure of the SFV NCP (Protein Data Bank accession number 1VCP). This homology structure was fitted into the CHIK VLP cryoEM density map by assuming T = 4 symmetry, using the EMfit program (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1B</a>). The positions of the quasi-symmetry axes were refined to optimize the fit to the density and to minimize clashes between symmetry related NCP structures. The refinement found that the placement of the quasi-symmetry axes did not change significantly from those optimized while fitting the glycoproteins. The orientation and placement of the homology NCP in the cryoEM density was essentially the same as described for other alphaviruses (<a href=\"#bib87\">Zhang et al., 2002</a>). Furthermore, the slight asymmetric twist of the pentameric and hexameric rings about the 5 and 2-fold axes, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A,2B</a>) was the same as that observed for Ross River virus (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng et al., 1995</a>)."

Consequently, the NCP structure was split into two domains (amino acid residues 119 to 183 and 184 to 267) representing the two lobes on either side of the substrate-binding cleft. These domains were then fitted independently at each of the four quasi-equivalent positions. The sumf values (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1B</a>) for fitting the NCP into the pentameric capsomer density (position #4, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) were slightly greater than for the NCPs in the hexameric capsomer (positions #1, #2, and #3), as was the case for the E1 protein fitting near the 5-fold axes. The correlation of the average residue densities between the four quasi-equivalent NCP positions was roughly the same as for fitting of the glycoproteins (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>), indicating the same level of amino acid recognition for the glycoproteins and the NCPs."

However, the six NCP molecules that form the hexameric capsomers around the icosahedral 2-fold axes made extensive contacts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl6\">Table 6</a>). These interactions were between the loop formed by residues 172 to 183 in one NCP molecule with residues in loops 190 to 206, 239 to 243 and 261 to 262 in a neighboring NCP molecule.

The alignment of the amino acid sequence with the cryoEM density was based on assigning the kink observed in the TM helix of E1 to the likely flexible Thr-Gly-Gly sequence.

It is also much larger than the RMS difference between C\u03b1 atoms on superimposing the equivalent molecular components of VEEV and CHIK VLPs without regard for the position and orientation of the icosahedral symmetry axes (<a href=\"#tbl8\">Table 8</a>). Thus the change in molecular positions and orientation with respect to the icosahedral framework is highly significant. Although the capsid protein amino acids are more conserved than any of the other structural proteins (<a href=\"#tbl8\">Table 8</a>), by far the largest differences in position and orientation of the molecular components occur for the capsid proteins (<a href=\"#tbl8\">Table 8</a>). The greater conservation of the amino acid sequences for the capsid protein is also reflected in a lower RMS differences between C\u03b1 atoms between superimposed capsid structures of VEEV and CHIK VLPs (less than 1.2 \u00c5) as opposed to a comparison of the other molecular components (greater than 2.0 \u00c5, <a href=\"#tbl8\">Table 8</a>)."

All Fab fragments bound the VLPs with one Fab fragment per E2 molecule. Except for CHK-152, the concentration of the Fab molecules required for 50% neutralization was 100 or more times greater than the intact IgG (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This implies a fundamental difference between how CHK-152 binds to the VLPs compared to the other Fabs. Because CHK-152 MAb and Fab fragment neutralize CHIKV at almost the same low concentration, it is unlikely that this MAb requires bivalent binding to inhibit infection."

To determine the modified position of the E2 B domain in these two complexes, the cryoEM density distributions were modified by setting to zero all density that was within 3 \u00c5 of all atoms in E1 and of all atoms in the A, C and D domains of E2.

For the VLP-CHK-152 and VLP-m10 Fab complexes, for which no crystal structures of the corresponding Fab fragments had been determined, both the CHK-9 and m242 Fab crystal structures were tested to determine which Fab yielded the better fit to the cryoEM map of the complex. VLP-CHK-152 and VLP-m10 Fab cryoEM maps were best fitted with the Fab structures of CHK-9 and of m242, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The T = 4 symmetry parameters, determined by fitting the E1-E2 heterodimer into the higher resolution VLP density, were used for fitting the Fab fragments into the cryoEM densities of the appropriate VLP-Fab complexes. The height of the density for the variable domains of the Fab fragments was comparable to that of the CHIKV glycoprotein, suggesting a nearly 100% binding occupancy of the Fab fragments under saturating binding conditions. The density for the constant domains (remote from the VLPs) of the Fab fragments was about 17% lower, consistent with the flexibility of the elbow angle between the constant and variable domains.

Indeed, binding of these fragments to the VLPs had nudged domain B \u223c10 \u00c5 sideways, out of the way of the Fab fragment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In contrast, the footprint of the m10 Fab mapped exclusively on domain B and did not cause any observable movement (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The footprint of CHK-152, however, spanned both domains B and A as well as the linker peptides to domain B represented by domain D. Thus, unlike the other Fabs, CHK-152 has the capacity to cross-link domain B with domain A. Alphaviruses become fusogenic at low pH when domain B, held in place by the flexible \u03b2-ribbons of domain D, becomes mobile and exposes the fusion loop on domain II of E1. As CHK-152 efficiently blocks viral fusion with host membranes (P Pal and M Diamond, unpublished observations), it may do so by cross-linking the flexible domain B to the rest of the virus surface. An analogous mechanism of inhibition was described for neutralization of West Nile virus, in which the viral envelope proteins were cross-linked by the bound FAB fragments (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kaufmann et al., 2010</a>)."

Nevertheless the proximity of these footprints to the possible receptor-binding site could probably allow neutralization by competitively limiting access of the virus to the cell surface receptor. To block formation of a fusogenic E1 trimer it is necessary to bind a Fab molecule to only one of the three E2 molecules in every spike. However, to block receptor attachment it is necessary to block all three receptor-binding sites on every spike. Such a stoichiometry would require substantially higher concentrations of Fabs to inhibit infectivity, as seen with CHK-9, m10 and m242 Fabs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The difference between MAb and Fab neutralization efficiency is presumably the result of bivalent attachment and cross-linking on a single virion or aggregation between virions. In summary our structural studies suggest that the CHK-9, m10, and m242 Fab fragments neutralize CHIKV infectivity by blocking the cellular binding site on the A domain of E2 and that the CHK152 inhibits fusion by stabilizing domain B of E2, preventing exposure of the fusion loop on E1."

The grids were frozen by plunging into liquid ethane. A FEI Titan Krios electron microscope operated at 300 kV was used to collect cryoEM images on Kodak SO-163 films at a magnification of 59,000\u00d7 and an electron dosage of \u223c25 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> at the boiling point of liquid nitrogen.

A total of 1532 films were developed using full strength D19 (Kodak) solution.

The selected micrographs were found to be under-focused by between 1.1 \u03bcm and 2.9 \u03bcm using the EMAN program CTFIT (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ludtke et al., 1999</a>). Initially a \u201cfour-fold binned\u201d map was used in which each set of 4 \u00d7 4 pixels was replaced by one pixel with the average height of the original sixteen pixels. Thus, the pixels in this map were separated by 4.44 \u00c5, limiting the resolution to \u223c13 \u00c5. An initial CHIK VLP model was produced by selecting particles with 5- 3- and 2-fold symmetric projections from which an icosahedral reconstruction was made. This model was iteratively refined using a coarse 5\u00b0 angular step size to improve the orientation and positioning of each particle until convergence was reached, as indicated by the lack of change of the Fourier shell correlation between successive cycles. At this point, the model had the characteristics of an alphavirus (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng et al., 1995</a>). In further iterations, the model was modified progressively by setting to zero both the inner density corresponding to the RNA genome and also the outer noise background density. Orientation and centers for each of the particles were determined by comparing the observed two-dimensional projections with projections of the model generated using a 1\u00b0 angular step size. Each observed projection was allocated to the three best fits in the calculated projection classes. The images associated with each class were averaged and used to generate an improved model for the next cycle. Only those particles whose orientations and centers had changed their orientation and position by less than 2\u00b0 and 2 pixels between successive cycles were retained for the next reconstruction.

Particles were discarded when their three top solutions did not converge. After each cycle, the resolution of the map was estimated and used to modify the model by filtering out the Fourier coefficients beyond the current resolution. Further improvement was hindered because it was assumed that the magnification of each micrograph was the same and that the defocus distance of each particle on a given micrograph was the same. The program Frealign (<a href=\"#bib21\">Grigorieff, 2007</a>) was used to refine orientation, position, defocus distance and relative pixel size for each micrograph using the original scanned data without binning. Particles were rejected that were found after refinement to have changes in any of these parameters by more than 2\u03c3. Overall convergence was established when the plot of the Fourier shell correlation vs resolution did not improve as estimated by visual inspection. The final map was reconstructed using 36,236 particles. The resolution of this map was estimated to be 4.6 \u00c5, based on the spacing at which the Fourier shell correlation fell below 0.5 (<a href=\"#bib77\">Van Heel, 1987</a>). To verify the effective resolution of the map (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chang et al., 2012</a>), the orientation of each image was determined with respect to the final map after having been low passed filtered to 7 \u00c5. The resultant orientations of the images were used to calculate the Fourier shell correlation between two equal random groups of all the images. The map resolution was found to be 5.3 \u00c5 using the 0.5 Fourier shell correlation criterion. A series of maps were calculated using a B factor applied to the Fourier coefficients of the inverted map to estimate the noise level and backbone density continuity. The best value of B was -40 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, which slightly increased the emphasis on the high order terms."

These domains were fitted sequentially (I, II, III, A, C, B, and D). After each domain was fitted independently, the map was modified by zeroing out the density around each fitted atom within a radius of 3.0 \u00c5. Thus, when fitting the next domain, atoms placed into zero density acted as a restraint by reducing the overall fitting criterion, \u201crcrit\u201d (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rossmann et al., 2001</a>). This process substituted for avoiding clashes had all domains been fitted simultaneously. After the individual domains had been fitted, the bond geometry between the carboxy end of one domain and the amino end of the next domain were regularized."

The quality of the independently fitted domain structure was also validated by comparing the fit of the atomic structures at each of the four quasi-equivalent densities. The density of each non-hydrogen atom in the CHIKV model was determined by interpolation using the densities at the eight surrounding grid points. The average density (\u03c1<sub>i</sub>) of residue i was then set to the average densities of all the atoms associated with this residue. The correlation coefficient (CC) was calculated between the densities \u03c1<sub>i</sub>(A) and \u03c1<sub>i</sub>(B) where these are the cryoEM densities of residue i at the quasi-equivalent positions A and B. The sums are taken over i = 1, N where N is the number of residues being matched."

This count is roughly equivalent to measuring the surface contact area between the two molecules<b>.</b> In addition to measuring the total number of contacts, a count was made of that portion of contacts that represented hydrophobic interactions by counting only carbon-carbon atom distances less than Dlim. Also, the number of potential hydrogen bonds was estimated by counting the number of short (Dlim &lt; 3.5 \u00c5) distances between oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Lastly, a count was made of possible formation of salt bridges by counting the number of occasions that an Arg, Lys or His residue approached to within Dlim of an Asp or Glu residue."

Images were recorded at 47,000\u00d7 magnification with a CM300 field emission gun microscope using electron dose levels of approximately 20 electrons per \u00c5<sup>2</sup>. All micrographs were digitized at 6.35 \u03bcm per pixel using a Nikon scanner. Individual particle images were boxed using the program e2boxer in the EMAN2 package. Subsequently, the boxed images were two-fold binned, resulting in a sampling of the specimen images at 2.69 \u00c5 intervals. The CTFIT program from the EMAN package was used to determine the contrast transfer function parameters. A cryoEM reconstruction of CHIK VLP, low pass filtered to 18 \u00c5, was used as an initial model for orientation determination and further refinement. The number of particles incorporated into the final reconstruction was 1728, 1820, and 1599 for Fabs m242, CHK9 and m10, giving final resolutions of 15.6 \u00c5, 14.9 \u00c5 and 16.9 \u00c5 on the basis of a 0.5 Fourier shell correlation threshold, respectively."

The present manuscript offers new insights at much higher resolution (around 5 \u00c5, see below) not only into the virus capsid structure itself, but also (although at considerably lower resolution) into how the capsid interacts with neutralizing antibodies. This is potentially of medical interest, given that there is at present no approved vaccine against the virus, which is a major human pathogen."

This led to the finding that the cryo-EM models of the relative positions of the domains of these proteins are consistent among the 4 quasi-equivalent heterodimers within the asymmetric unit of the icosaheral particle, but different from those of the crystal structures. Consequently, the molecular contacts between the subunits are more extensive in the cryo-EM structure than in the crystal structure. The authors attribute these differences to the crystal packing. A lesson to be drawn from this work is the merit of obtaining a cryo-EM structure even at a lower resolution than the crystal structure to reveal the structure of the virus proteins free of potential crystallization artifacts and close to the solution state conformation."

We re-determined the orientation of each boxed image against a 7 \u00c5 low-pass filtered map of our current model. These new orientations were then used for a Fourier shell coefficient analysis in which the images had been divided into two equal groups. The result gave a resolution of 5.3 \u00c5 using a Fourier correlation of 0.5 as a cut off.
