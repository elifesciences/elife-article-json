                    "text": "Previously, we reported that long-term memory (LTM) in <i>Aplysia</i> can be reinstated by truncated (partial) training following its disruption by reconsolidation blockade and inhibition of PKM (Chen et al., 2014). Here, we report that LTM can be induced by partial training after disruption of original consolidation by protein synthesis inhibition (PSI) begun shortly after training. But when PSI occurs during training, partial training cannot subsequently establish LTM. Furthermore, we find that inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), whether during training or shortly afterwards, blocks consolidation of LTM and prevents its subsequent induction by truncated training; moreover, later inhibition of DNMT eliminates consolidated LTM. Thus, the consolidation of LTM depends on two functionally distinct phases of protein synthesis: an early phase that appears to prime LTM; and a later phase whose successful completion is necessary for the normal expression of LTM. Both the consolidation and maintenance of LTM depend on DNA methylation."

Here, we report that LTM can be induced by partial training after disruption of original consolidation by protein synthesis inhibition (PSI) begun shortly after training. But when PSI occurs during training, partial training cannot subsequently establish LTM. Furthermore, we find that inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), whether during training or shortly afterwards, blocks consolidation of LTM and prevents its subsequent induction by truncated training; moreover, later inhibition of DNMT eliminates consolidated LTM. Thus, the consolidation of LTM depends on two functionally distinct phases of protein synthesis: an early phase that appears to prime LTM; and a later phase whose successful completion is necessary for the normal expression of LTM. Both the consolidation and maintenance of LTM depend on DNA methylation."

Snails that had this priming trace could form a long-term memory after partial training, whereas untrained snails did not form memories after such partial training."

In addition, both the consolidation and maintenance of long-term memory depend on one or more genes that otherwise suppress memory being inhibited via DNA methylation. Future work will now aim to identify the priming trace and the genes that suppress memory. Knowledge of the priming trace could lead to new treatments for memory-related disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Furthermore, identifying genes that can suppress memory might allow us to reduce some of the harmful effects of traumatic experience."

Moreover, the protein synthesis underlying memory consolidation has been observed to exhibit a temporal gradient: inhibition of protein synthesis during or shortly after training appears to be maximally disruptive of memory consolidation; significantly less amnesia is caused by protein synthesis inhibition (PSI) that commences approximately an hour or more after training (<a href=\"#bib23\">Davis and Squire, 1984</a>)."

Consequently, both early and late protein synthesis are commonly regarded as participating in a more-or-less unitary consolidative process. In particular, protein synthesis is believed to mediate critical late events in memory consolidation, including late gene transcription via the synthesis of transcription factors, such as the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), and the consequent synthesis of proteins involved in the construction of new synaptic connections (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bailey et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kandel et al., 2014</a>)."

However, the relationship between protein synthesis and DNA methylation in memory consolidation is unclear. Mechanistically, is protein synthesis upstream or downstream of DNA methylation during consolidation? DNA methylation is usually associated with gene silencing. If DNA methylation is required for the synthesis of necessary consolidative proteins, this would imply that a prerequisite for this synthesis is the silencing of one or more repressor genes. On the other hand, it is possible that activation of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), the family of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to DNA, during memory consolidation itself depends on protein synthesis. Of course, these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive."

By contrast, both early and late inhibition of DNMT block LTM consolidation as indicated by the preclusion of subsequent memory induction by partial training. These results point to a functional distinction between early and late protein synthesis in memory consolidation, and suggest a potential role for early protein synthesis in DNA methylation. Finally, we show that inhibition of DNMT disrupts not only the consolidation, but also the persistence, of LTM; thus, the maintenance of consolidated LTM requires\u00a0ongoing DNA methylation."

Accordingly, some sensorimotor cocultures were treated with anisomycin (10 \u00b5M, 2 h)\u00a0immediately after training with five 5-min pulses of 5HT (100 \u00b5M; 5X5HT training), spaced at 15-min intervals\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Cai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Chen et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).\u00a0To test whether\u00a0LTF could be induced by partial training following its potential disruption by posttraining anisomycin treatment, three spaced pulses of 5HT (3X5HT training) were used.

Notice that the mean EPSP in the 5X5HT-Aniso-3X5HT group was not significantly different from that in the 5X5HT group, which indicates that the supplemental\u00a0partial training\u00a0induced normal LTF.

We performed an experiment like that shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, except that animals given RG108 at 24 h\u00a0received 5 bouts of training (that is, full LTS training) at 48 h\u00a0rather than 3 bouts of training (partial training) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>).

There were four experimental groups: Control-Veh group (<i>n</i> = 6), 5XTrained-Veh group (<i>n</i> = 6), 5XTrained-RG group (<i>n</i> = 4), and 5XTrained-RG-5XTrained group (<i>n</i> = 6). A repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that the group x time interaction was significant (F<sub>[9,54]</sub> = 61.4, p &lt; 0.0001).

                        "text": "We have shown that protein synthesis during and shortly after sensitization training is essential for the normal consolidation of LTM in <i>Aplysia</i>. Our results therefore confirm previous results obtained in <i>Aplysia</i> by <a href=\"#bib50\">Montarolo et al. (1986)</a> and <a href=\"#bib19\">Castellucci et al. (1989)</a>, as well in vertebrates by many groups (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib23\">Davis and Squire, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hernandez and Abel, 2008</a>). In addition, however, we have significantly extended\u00a0prior findings regarding protein synthesis and memory consolidation through our demonstration that LTM can be induced by supplemental partial training following its disruption by PSI shortly after the original (full) LTS training, but not following PSI during the original\u00a0LTS training. Thus, the present results reveal a novel functional distinction between the mnemonic role of protein synthesis during training and that of protein synthesis shortly after training.\u00a0An early study in <i>Aplysia</i> indicated that bath-applied anisomycin (18 \u00b5M) produces rapid (\u226415 min), nearly complete (95\u201399%) inhibition of protein synthesis, as measured by the incorporation of leucine into proteins in identified central neurons (<a href=\"#bib57\">Schwartz et al., 1971</a>). Because the pretraining\u00a0injections of anisomycin in our study were made 10\u201320 min prior to the onset of training, and because the duration of the 5X\u00a0training in our study was\u00a0~80 min, the\u00a0pretraining anisomycin treatment would be expected to produce\u00a0&gt;90% disruption of protein synthesis in the animals throughout much, if not all, of the training period. The posttraining injections of anisomycin in our study were made 10\u201320 min after the end of 5X training; if one assumes a maximum post-injection time of 15 min for the onset of significant PSI within the central nervous system (CNS) of the animals (<a href=\"#bib57\">Schwartz et al., 1971</a>)\u2014drugs injected into the hemocoel of <i>Aplysia</i> have ready access to the CNS due to the open circulatory system and lack of a blood-brain barrier in gastropod mollusks (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott et al., 1986</a>)\u2014then the posttraining injections of anisomycin should have begun to inhibit protein synthesis by\u00a0&gt;90% within 30 min after the end of 5X training.\u00a0Our results indicate that proteins synthesized during training (early protein synthesis)\u00a0play a special\u00a0role in the consolidation of LTM. Specifically, early protein synthesis causes the generation of\u00a0a priming component that allows LTM to be later established by partial training if it is disrupted by\u00a0posttraining PSI (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>).\u00a0<a href=\"#bib10\">Barzilai et al. (1989)</a> reported that a 1.5-h treatment with 5HT produces the rapid onset (&lt;30 min) of the synthesis of several (unidentified) proteins; in addition, the synthesis of some of these proteins depends on gene transcription, suggesting that they represent immediate-early proteins.\u00a0Thus, the priming component induced by early protein synthesis in our study may be the product of immediate-early gene transcription. In support of this idea, <a href=\"#bib54\">Rajasethupathy et al. (2012)</a>\u00a0found that exposure to five spaced pulses of 5HT down\u00a0regulated the expression of the transcriptional repressor CREB2 in <i>Aplysia</i> sensory neurons; moreover, this downregulation depended on methylation of the <i>CREB2</i> gene, because it was blocked by the DNMT inhibitor RG108. CREB2 is regarded as a memory suppressor in <i>Aplysia\u00a0</i>(<a href=\"#bib2\">Abel et al., 1998</a>)\u00a0(although see <a href=\"#bib33\">Hu et al., 2015</a>); blockade of CREB2 activity (by means of a function-blocking antiserum) in <i>Aplysia</i> sensory neurons\u00a0has been shown to facilitate the induction of LTF\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Bartsch et al., 1995</a>). The memory suppressive effect of CREB2 is due, at least in part, to the repression of CREB1 activation and the downstream expression of immediate-early genes, including\u00a0the <i>C/EBP</i>\u00a0gene\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Alberini et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Alberini and Kandel, 2014</a>). Thus, the expression of CREB1-dependent immediate-early genes, enabled through 5HT-induced DNA methylation of <i>CREB2</i>, could form the priming memory component revealed by the present experiments. According to this idea, DNA methylation would be upstream from the early protein synthesis required for memory consolidation in <i>Aplysia</i>."

(Note that our results appear to partly contradict those of <a href=\"#bib50\">Montarolo et al. (1986</a>) who observed that anisomycin applied to sensorimotor cocultures starting at 30 min after 5X5HT training did not block LTF; however, the onset of the anisomycin application in our experiments was\u00a0~15 min earlier than in the Montarolo et al. study, which may explain the apparent discrepancy in results.) In support of the present findings, <a href=\"#bib60\">Shobe et al. (2016)</a> have recently reported that consolidation of the LTM for sensitization is disrupted by posttraining application of the protein synthesis inhibitor emetine to a reduced preparation of <i>Aplysia</i>. Therefore, PSI after training does not disrupt the memory primer, which is induced by early protein synthesis\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). It seems likely, moreover, that it is the persistence of this primer that underlies the ability of truncated training to reinstate LTM following its disruption by reconsolidation blockade or inhibition of PKM (<a href=\"#bib20\">Chen et al., 2014</a>)."

In support of this idea,\u00a0sensitization training that is sufficient to induce LTM has recently been found to cause prolonged (1 h) posttraining activation of MAPK\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib60\">Shobe et al., 2016</a>). But posttraining PSI disrupts this persistent MAPK\u00a0activity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib60\">Shobe et al., 2016</a>), and we have shown that the memory priming signal is maintained despite posttraining blockade of translation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). Although the priming signal cannot therefore be MAPK itself, it could be a signal downstream from activated MAPK.\u00a0<a href=\"#bib44\">Martin et al. (1997)</a> showed that during 5HT-induced LTF MAPK translocates to the nucleus of sensory neurons; this nuclear translocation is required for LTF. Possibly, the priming signal is a nuclear change downstream\u00a0of MAPK. Epigenetic modifications are attractive candidates for the priming signal. Indeed, MAPK-dependent increases in the phosphorylation of histone H3 have been implicated in LTM in rats (<a href=\"#bib21\">Chwang et al., 2006</a>)\u00a0and snails (<a href=\"#bib22\">Danilova et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore,\u00a0we previously showed that inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) permitted 3X sensitization training to induce LTM in na\u00efve, untrained animals\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). Thus, persistent histone modifications induced by 5X training may provide the scaffolding necessary for later reconstruction of LTM by partial training during memory reinstatement. Besides MAPK-dependent\u00a0epigenetic modifications, other candidates for the priming signal include small, non-coding RNAs, the expression of which is induced by 5HT training during LTF (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rajasethupathy et al., 2012</a>).\u00a0In future research\u00a0we will seek to identify the memory priming signal."

Similar to our finding that LTF\u00a0was absent at 24 h\u00a0in sensorimotor cocultures after 5X5HT training followed by exposure to anisomycin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), Ryan et al. observed an absence of learning-induced long-term potentiation (LTP)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib31\">Herring and Nicoll, 2016</a>)\u00a0in hippocampal slices from anisomycin-treated animals; this synaptic disruption correlated with retrograde amnesia.\u00a0Despite the lack of persistent synaptic changes widely regarded as hallmarks of consolidated memory (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bailey et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Dudai et al., 2015</a>), some aspect of LTM nonetheless endured\u00a0in the two studies."

(2015)</a> did not test whether LTM could be induced by optogenetic stimulation subsequent to PSI during fear conditioning, nor did they propose a specific storage mechanism for LTM. Our data point to DNA methylation as being essential for the consolidation of LTM. Prior work in mammals also supports a critical role for DNA methylation in memory consolidation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Halder et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Levenson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Miller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Miller and Sweatt, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Monsey et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Oliveira, 2016</a>). More relevantly, Kandel and colleagues reported that RG108 blocks the establishment of LTF in <i>Aplysia</i> sensorimotor cocultures, and that this effect is due, at least in part, to blockade of 5HT-induced methylation of the gene for the transcriptional repressor CREB2 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rajasethupathy et al., 2012</a>). The present results elaborate upon this idea; besides showing that the consolidation of LTM in <i>Aplysia</i> requires epigenetic suppression of one or more memory repressor processes, our results suggest the intriguing possibility that this suppression may depend on early protein synthesis. Although little is known at present regarding the potential role of protein synthesis in DNA modification, a report that activity-dependent induction of a specific gene, <i>Gadd45b</i>, is essential for DNA demethylation in the mammalian hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ma et al., 2009</a>) is consistent with this idea. Furthermore, in their study of the epigenetic regulation of memory consolidation in <i>Aplysia</i>, <a href=\"#bib54\">Rajasethupathy et al. (2012)</a> found that DNA methylation of <i>CREB2</i> was regulated by a neuronally expressed Piwi protein. Perhaps the early protein synthesis mediating the consolidation of LTM involves the expression of Piwi in <i>Aplysia</i>. In the absence of direct evidence that protein synthesis triggers DNA methylation in <i>Aplysia</i>, however, it is\u00a0at least as plausible\u00a0that the process of DNA methylation is upstream, rather than downstream, of early protein synthesis in the consolidation of LTM, as discussed above."

An obvious candidate, of course, is <i>CREB2</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bartsch et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rajasethupathy et al., 2012</a>), but there are others. For example, phosphatases have been proposed to subserve memory repression in mammals. <a href=\"#bib45\">Miller and Sweatt (2007)</a> found that infusion\u00a0of a DNMT inhibitor into the hippocampus of rats immediately after contextual fear conditioning blocked the consolidation of fear memory as assessed 24 h\u00a0later, and that this effect was due, in part, to DNA methylation of the gene for protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Another phosphatase that may subserve memory repression, and whose gene may become silenced by DNA methylation during learning, is calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Baumg\u00e4rtel and Mansuy, 2012</a>). Calcineurin activity suppresses the induction of hippocampal LTP (<a href=\"#bib61\">Winder et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Winder and Sweatt, 2001</a>). Moreover, genetically overexpressing calcineurin in the brains of mice disrupts the consolidation of LTM\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib43\">Mansuy et al., 1998</a>), whereas genetically inhibiting calcineurin enhances hippocampal LTP and LTM in mice (<a href=\"#bib42\">Malleret et al., 2001</a>). In addition, <a href=\"#bib11\">Baumg\u00e4rtel et al.

However, both phosphatases modulate the CREB-mediated response to extracellular stimuli in <i>Aplysia\u00a0</i>signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hawkins et al., 2006</a>).

Previously, we showed\u00a0that although inhibition of PKM Apl III, the <i>Aplysia</i> homolog of PKM\u03b6\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Bougie et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2009</a>), and reconsolidation blockade both disrupt the consolidated LTM for behavioral sensitization in <i>Aplysia\u00a0</i>(<a href=\"#bib17\">Cai et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2012</a>), the memory can nonetheless be fully reinstated using truncated sensitization training (<a href=\"#bib20\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). By contrast, as shown in the present study, the LTM for sensitization cannot be reinstated after its disruption by inhibition of DNMT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig9\">9</a>). This finding indicates that the ongoing DNA methylation of one or more genes\u00a0is a precondition for memory maintenance, and, moreover, that\u00a0some essential priming component of LTM, one whose persistence enables LTM reinstatement, must be impervious to the disruptive effects of PKM inhibition and of reconsolidation blockade, but eliminable by inhibition of DNMT."

                        "text": "In summary, we have found that\u00a0two functionally distinct periods of protein synthesis regulate the consolidation of LTM in <i>Aplysia</i>. The earlier period occurs during training (and, possibly,\u00a0extends into the immediate posttraining period as well); it involves the production of a memory priming element. The later period starts within 30 min after training; proteins synthesized during this posttraining period are required for the normal expression of LTM. Nonetheless, inhibition of the synthesis of these late proteins, albeit disruptive of LTM, does not impair the priming element, whose occult presence permits LTM to be established by supplemental partial training following its disruption by posttraining PSI. Finally, we have shown that both the consolidation and maintenance of LTM in <i>Aplysia\u00a0</i>depend, in part, on gene silencing via DNA methylation. Future work will be required to determine the identity of the gene/s whose DNA methylation is required for the induction and persistence of LTM, and whether this methylation is triggered by early protein synthesis."

If the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin selectively affected expression, this effect should require the presence of anisomycin at the time of the posttest. In <i>Aplysia</i>, the effects of anisomycin disappear within approximately 3 hours, as demonstrated by Montarolo et al. (1986). Because posttests were conducted at 24 hours and anisomycin effects should have ended at least 20 hours earlier, there should be no remaining effects on retrieval at the time of the posttest. Furthermore, the efficacy of post training anisomycin in blocking memory tested at 24 hours is highly dependent on the precise time of anisomycin administration. Montarolo et al. transiently applied anisomycin only shortly after the time point chosen in the present experiments; they found that memory retention was largely protein synthesis independent 30 min after a series of 5-HT exposures, and completely protein synthesis independent 4 hours after the end of the 5-HT. If protein synthesis inhibition impaired retrieval, the effect should be the same for applications at these several time points shortly after training. (The Montarolo et al. paper should be cited when the post training anisomycin experiment is first introduced.) Even blocking protein synthesis for 22 hours but beginning 30 min after a series of 5-HT exposures, did not dramatically block long-term facilitation measured at 24 hours. Thus, these earlier published data from <i>Aplysia</i> would strongly suggest that inhibition of protein synthesis 15 minutes after the end of 1.5 hour training protocol does not selectively impair expression of memory without affecting consolidation. Interestingly, although the authors cite Montarolo et al., they don't consider this earlier evidence that consolidation is still progressing at the post training time point that they apply anisomycin."

Does this suggest memory maintenance requires persistent DNMT activity, as found by Miller, Sweatt and colleagues, 2010? Or is DNA methylation the signal that persists after protein synthesis inhibition (and blockade of reconsolidation) and that primes memory formation when there is additional abbreviated training? (These possibilities are not mutually exclusive.) Rajasethupathy et al. found that piRNAs are upregulated by 5-HT application during long-term facilitation, and these piRNAs promote methylation of the promoter for the inhibitor CREB, CREB2, suppressing its expression. The authors' data suggest that maintenance of DNA methylation does not require protein synthesis, but rather is perhaps upstream from protein synthesis, which is consistent with the Rajasethupathy results. Nevertheless, the authors suggest that perhaps \"PSI during training obstructs DNA methylation required for memory consolidation,\" citing Rajasethupathy et al. This proposal should be revised, as it contradicts the authors' data and also the Rajasethupathy et al. findings. Importantly, the Rajasethupathy et al. results are consistent with the understanding that memory formation is regulated by a balance between repressors and activators of memory consolidation; the \"priming effect\" on memory formation by subsequent abbreviated training protocol observed here could involve suppression of expression of CREB2 due to DNA methylation, a possibility that the authors should discuss."

In this manuscript, the authors show that protein synthesis block 15 minutes after LTF training blocks memory consolidation but also similarly leaves a trace that primes subsequent memory restoration. They explore whether and now this persistent component of memory that survives the retraction of newly formed synapses is localized to the nucleus. The originally submitted Research Advance manuscript was quite strong, but with the addition of new experiments that test the effect of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors applied after memory has been fully consolidated, this manuscript now is greatly improved and enhanced and should much higher impact. The intriguing conclusion is that ongoing DNA methylation is essential for memory maintenance even days after training. One particularly compelling experiment tested the efficacy of late, 5x training after earlier exposure to the DNMT inhibitor to confirm that learning is still possible."

The early phase of protein synthesis has long been understood to be essential for memory consolidation. Certainly, Barzilai et al. (1989) suggested that the early wave of protein synthesis reflected expression of immediate early genes, including transcription factors that would initiate expression of genes critical for synaptic plasticity and learning. C/EBP is one such immediate early gene transcription factor in both <i>Aplysia</i> and mammals. It is important to put the priming mechanism that the authors identify into the context of immediate early gene expression. One mechanism suggested by Rajasethupathy et al. 2012 is that DNA methylation inhibits expression of CREB2, a suppressor of memory formation. With CREB2 expression reduced, initiation of the CREB-dependent transcription of immediate early genes, including transcription factors, can be enhanced. It is likely that the expression of these transcription factors represents the first wave of protein synthesis, which is sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors during the training protocol. Rajasethupathy should be cited and this section of the manuscript clarified."

If the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin selectively affected expression, this effect should require the presence of anisomycin at the time of the posttest. In Aplysia, the effects of anisomycin disappear within approximately 3 hours, as demonstrated by Montarolo et al. (1986). Because posttests were conducted at 24 hours and anisomycin effects should have ended at least 20 hours earlier, there should be no remaining effects on retrieval at the time of the posttest. Furthermore, the efficacy of post training anisomycin in blocking memory tested at 24 hours is highly dependent on the precise time of anisomycin administration. Montarolo et al. transiently applied anisomycin only shortly after the time point chosen in the present experiments; they found that memory retention was largely protein synthesis independent 30 min after a series of 5-HT exposures, and completely protein synthesis independent 4 hours after the end of the 5-HT. If protein synthesis inhibition impaired retrieval, the effect should be the same for applications at these several time points shortly after training. (The Montarolo et al. paper should be cited when the post training anisomycin experiment is first introduced.) Even blocking protein synthesis for 22 hours but beginning 30 min after a series of 5-HT exposures, did not dramatically block long-term facilitation measured at 24 hours. Thus, these earlier published data from Aplysia would strongly suggest that inhibition of protein synthesis 15 minutes after the end of 1.5 hour training protocol does not selectively impair expression of memory without affecting consolidation. Interestingly, although the authors cite Montarolo et al., they don't consider this earlier evidence that consolidation is still progressing at the post training time point that they apply anisomycin.</i> "

Does this suggest memory maintenance requires persistent DNMT activity, as found by Miller, Sweatt and colleagues, 2010? Or is DNA methylation the signal that persists after protein synthesis inhibition (and blockade of reconsolidation) and that primes memory formation when there is additional abbreviated training? (These possibilities are not mutually exclusive.) Rajasethupathy et al. found that piRNAs are upregulated by 5-HT application during long-term facilitation, and these piRNAs promote methylation of the promoter for the inhibitor CREB, CREB2, suppressing its expression. The authors' data suggest that maintenance of DNA methylation does not require protein synthesis, but rather is perhaps upstream from protein synthesis, which is consistent with the Rajasethupathy results. Nevertheless, the authors suggest that perhaps \"PSI during training obstructs DNA methylation required for memory consolidation,\" citing Rajasethupathy et al. This proposal should be revised, as it contradicts the authors' data and also the Rajasethupathy et al. findings. Importantly, the Rajasethupathy et al. results are consistent with the understanding that memory formation is regulated by a balance between repressors and activators of memory consolidation; the \"priming effect\" on memory formation by subsequent abbreviated training protocol observed here could involve suppression of expression of CREB2 due to DNA methylation, a possibility that the authors should discuss.</i> "

The revised manuscript also includes experiments to control for nonspecific effects of the DNMT inhibitor (RG108) used (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); to ensure that the disruptive effect of DNA methylation cannot be attributed to reconsolidation blockade (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>); and to show that the disruptive effect of DNMT inhibition on LTM does not preclude the reestablishment of LTM by the full (5X) training (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). The new results demonstrate that inhibition of DNA methylation abolishes LTM\u2014as indicated by the inability of truncated training to instate/reinstate LTM\u2014regardless of when it is carried out. These results demonstrate a striking, unambiguous dependence of both the consolidation and maintenance of LTM on DNA methylation. As we conclude, our results imply that the consolidation of LTM requires the initial silencing of one or more genes that encode memory repressors; moreover, the maintenance of LTM also depends on the persistent silencing of this gene/these genes."

We show that of the three forms of mnemonic impairment, only inhibition of DNA methylation results in the inability to reinstate memory by truncated (3X) training (see Chen et al., 2014). In light of the present results, this implies that the priming signal (see our response to point 1 above) persists after reconsolidation blockade and inhibition of PKM, but is eliminated by inhibition of DNA methylation.

The early phase of protein synthesis has long been understood to be essential for memory consolidation. Certainly, Barzilai et al. (1989) suggested that the early wave of protein synthesis reflected expression of immediate early genes, including transcription factors that would initiate expression of genes critical for synaptic plasticity and learning. C/EBP is one such immediate early gene transcription factor in both Aplysia and mammals. It is important to put the priming mechanism that the authors identify into the context of immediate early gene expression. One mechanism suggested by Rajasethupathy et al. 2012 is that DNA methylation inhibits expression of CREB2, a suppressor of memory formation. With CREB2 expression reduced, initiation of the CREB-dependent transcription of immediate early genes, including transcription factors, can be enhanced. It is likely that the expression of these transcription factors represents the first wave of protein synthesis, which is sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors during the training protocol. Rajasethupathy should be cited and this section of the manuscript clarified.</i> "
