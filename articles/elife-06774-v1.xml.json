While no structures of a voltage-sensor toxin bound to a channel have been solved, a structural homolog, psalmotoxin (PcTx1), was recently crystalized in complex with the extracellular domain of an acid sensing ion channel (ASIC). In the present study we use spectroscopic, biophysical and computational approaches to compare membrane interaction properties and channel binding surfaces of PcTx1 with the voltage-sensor toxin guangxitoxin (GxTx-1E). Our results show that both types of tarantula toxins interact with membranes, but that voltage-sensor toxins partition deeper into the bilayer. In addition, our results suggest that tarantula toxins have evolved a similar concave surface for clamping onto \u03b1-helices that is effective in aqueous or lipidic physical environments."

While no structures of a voltage-sensor toxin bound to a channel have been solved, a structural homolog, psalmotoxin (PcTx1), was recently crystalized in complex with the extracellular domain of an acid sensing ion channel (ASIC). In the present study we use spectroscopic, biophysical and computational approaches to compare membrane interaction properties and channel binding surfaces of PcTx1 with the voltage-sensor toxin guangxitoxin (GxTx-1E). Our results show that both types of tarantula toxins interact with membranes, but that voltage-sensor toxins partition deeper into the bilayer. In addition, our results suggest that tarantula toxins have evolved a similar concave surface for clamping onto \u03b1-helices that is effective in aqueous or lipidic physical environments."

For example, scorpion toxins that physically block the pore of K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib46\">MacKinnon and Miller, 1988</a>) were initially used to identify pore-forming regions of the channel (<a href=\"#bib47\">MacKinnon and Miller, 1989</a>), and to determine the stoichiometry of subunits (<a href=\"#bib44\">MacKinnon, 1991</a>), inactivation gates (<a href=\"#bib45\">MacKinnon et al., 1993</a>), as well as accessory subunits (<a href=\"#bib53\">Morin and Kobertz, 2008</a>). Protein toxins can also interact with ion channels and allosterically modify the process by which the channel opens in response to the stimulus that activates the channel. For example, both tarantula and scorpion toxins can bind to voltage-sensing domains in voltage-activated ion channels and either retard or facilitate activation in response to changes in voltage (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rogers et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Swartz and MacKinnon, 1997a</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">1997b</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cest\u00e8le et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Milescu et al., 2013</a>). This second class of toxins have been valuable tools to explore the mechanism of voltage sensing (<a href=\"#bib56\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alabi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Campos et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2008</a>) and the roles of individual voltage sensors in the mechanisms of activation and inactivation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Campos et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bosmans et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Campos et al., 2008</a>). Tarantula toxins have also been discovered that activate transient receptor potential (TRP) channels (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bohlen et al., 2010</a>), and both tarantula toxin and snake toxins have been identified that activate acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Salinas et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bohlen et al., 2011</a>).

The strong interaction of these tarantula toxins with lipid membranes is mediated by a prominent amphipathic surface on the toxins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Takahashi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2010</a>), which facilitates their entry into the membrane (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lee and MacKinnon, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Milescu et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jung et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mihailescu et al., 2014</a>). Although many aspects of this inhibitory mechanism have been well-studied (<a href=\"#bib67\">Swartz and MacKinnon, 1997a</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">1997b</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Li-Smerin and Swartz, 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alabi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Milescu et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bosmans et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Milescu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mihailescu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tilley et al., 2014</a>), no structures of complexes between tarantula toxins and Kv channels have been solved, limiting our understanding of how tarantula toxins dock onto voltage sensors and influence their conformational dynamics. However, a structurally related tarantula toxin named PcTx1 was recently crystalized in complex with ASIC1a (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dawson et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, left), revealing that the toxin clamps onto the thumb helix-5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) and inserts an Arginine finger into the subunit interface to interact with residues involved in proton activation of the channel. PcTx1 modulates the gating properties of ASIC1 channels by enhancing the apparent affinity of these channels for protons, thereby promoting open and desensitized states of the channel (<a href=\"#bib21\">Escoubas et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Salinas et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dawson et al., 2012</a>), an allosteric mechanism related to that employed by tarantula toxins targeting Kv channels. However, in contrast to the present model for tarantula toxins binding to Kv channels within the membrane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right), the structures of PcTx1 bound to ASIC show that the toxin binds to the protein in aqueous solution far from the transmembrane domains of the channel (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> left). Interestingly, the overall fold of PcTx1 and voltage sensor toxins are quite similar (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) and PcTx1 has significant amphipathic character (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), similar to that seen in the structure of voltage-sensor toxins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

Does the amphipathic surface of PcTx1 enable the toxin to interact with membranes even though it binds to ASIC in solution? If so, how does the interaction of PcTx1 with membranes compare with that observed for toxins targeting voltage sensors? Do the two classes of structurally related toxins use distinct surfaces for binding to Kv channels within the membrane and to ASIC channels in solution? Our results demonstrate that both classes of tarantula toxins interact with membranes, but that PcTx1 interacts more superficially when compare to toxins targeting voltage sensors. In addition, our results suggest that PcTx1 and the voltage-sensor toxins use related surfaces for binding to helices within their target channels even though these events occur in very different physical environments."

Both toxins have a similar spacing of six Cys residues that participate in forming disulfide bonds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), and NMR solution structures reveal they adopt similar folds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D,H</a>), with backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) over 20\u201322 core residues of 1.0\u20131.2 \u00c5 and over all residues of 2.9 \u00c5.

We conducted experiments to assess whether PcTx1 partitions into membranes similar to voltage sensor toxins. One common approach to measuring membrane partitioning is Trp fluorescence, where the emission spectra of Trp residues on the toxins are shifted to lower wavelengths (blue shifted) when the toxin moves from an aqueous environment to a more constraining and hydrophobic environment of the lipid membrane (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ladokhin et al., 2000</a>). Pronounced blue shifts in Trp fluorescence are observed with GxTx-1E when lipid vesicles containing a 1:1 mix of POPC and POPG are added to aqueous solutions of the toxin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), consistent with a previous study (<a href=\"#bib49\">Milescu et al., 2009</a>). Plotting of fluorescence intensity of GxTx-1E in the blue shifted region (320 nm) of the emission spectra as a function of lipid concentration and fitting of a partition function (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) yields a mole fraction K<sub>x</sub> of 4.6 \u00b1 0.8 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>, indicating favorable interactions of the toxin with membranes. To investigate whether PcTx1 can interact with membranes, we performed similar experiments and observed detectable blue shifts in the emission spectra of the toxin upon the addition of lipid vesicles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The blue shifts in the case of PcTx1 were very small (maximal shift of \u223c 2 nm), however, they varied as a function of lipid concentration and saturated at high lipid concentrations, suggestive of an interaction between PcTx1 and lipid membranes."

                                "text": "The results thus far reveal that both classes of tarantula toxins interact quite favorably with lipid membranes. Although the structure of PcTx1 shows the presence of a clear hydrophobic cluster of residues on one face of the toxin, it is smaller than seen in structures of voltage-sensor toxins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). For example, the solvent accessible surface area for the hydrophobic surface of PcTx1 is 380 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, which compares with a value of 703 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> for GxTx-1E. In addition, the hydrophobic surfaces on the two toxins are situated on distinct surfaces (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). These differences between PcTx1 and GxTx-1E raise the possibility that the two classes of toxin might exhibit distinct depths of penetration into membranes. To estimate the depth to which these toxins penetrate lipid membranes, we compared the extent of quenching of Trp fluorescence by bromine atoms attached at different positions along lipid acyl chains (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ladokhin, 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2014</a>). In previous studies, the analysis of quenching profiles for lipids brominated at three positions along the acyl chain of POPC (from most superficial to deepest; 6,7-diBr, 9,10-diBr or 11,12-diBr) have shown the strongest quenching for bromines attached near the middle of the lipid tail (9,10-diBr), and analysis of these profiles suggested that Trp residues in hanatoxin, SGTx (a close relative of hanatoxin) and VSTx are positioned 8\u20139 \u00c5 from the center of the bilayer (<a href=\"#bib56\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Swartz, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jung et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mihailescu et al., 2014</a>). When we performed quenching experiments with these three brominated lipids and GxTx-1E, we observed strong quenching that is similar to what has been reported previously for other voltage-sensor toxins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Swartz, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jung et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mihailescu et al., 2014</a>), confirming an intimate interaction of the toxin with the hydrophobic core of the membrane. However, we observed only relatively small differences between the three brominated lipids, precluding further quantitative analysis of the profiles to obtain a specific depth of penetration. We suspect that this unique pattern of quenching by brominated lipids for GxTx-1E might be caused by the presence of three Trp residues in the toxin, each of which will likely be in distinct positions when the toxin interacts with membranes (see below). Interestingly, when we undertook similar experiments with PcTx1, we observed only very weak quenching by brominated lipids, again with only relatively small differences between the three lipids (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The measurable quenching observed for PcTx1 confirms that this toxin interacts with membranes, however, the much weaker quenching when compared to voltage-sensor toxins indicates that this toxin interacts considerably more superficially with membranes."

PcTx1 also contains an Arg finger motif composed of R26, R27 and R28 that is required for activation of ASIC through interactions with channel residues situated in a crevice between subunits. In the case of voltage-sensor toxins such as hanatoxin and GxTx-1E, the S3b helix within the voltage-sensing domains of Kv channels contains the most influential determinants of toxin binding, and these also involve a combination of hydrophobic and polar residue interactions (<a href=\"#bib68\">Swartz and MacKinnon, 1997b</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Li-Smerin and Swartz, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alabi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Milescu et al., 2009</a>). Given the common helical targets of PcTx1 and voltage-sensor toxins, and the finding that PcTx1 can interact with membranes, we wondered whether it might be possible to transfer sensitivity to PcTx1 into a Kv channel by exchanging the S3b helix with helix-5 from ASIC. We did not attempt to transfer channel residues interacting with the arginine finger motif because these residues and helix-5 are noncontiguous in the ASIC sequence. PcTx1 has nM affinity for ASIC1a (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dawson et al., 2012</a>), but even at very high concentrations (5 \u00b5M) has no effect on the Kv2.1 channel (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

We generated a total of five chimeras where nine residues of helix-5 replaced nine residues in the S3b helix in five different frames starting at the N-terminal end of the S3b helix (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). All five chimeras gave rise to robust voltage-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents and displayed voltage-activation relations that were shifted to more depolarized voltages when compared to the wild-type Kv2.1 channel (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013G</a>), consistent with disruption of the interactions between S3b and S4 helices that have been shown to stabilize voltage sensors in an activated state (<a href=\"#bib74\">Xu et al., 2013</a>). Although these relatively radical chimeras were all functional, extracellular application of high concentrations of PcTx1 had no discernible effect on the activity of any of them (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013G</a>). We also constructed models of PcTx1 bound to the five chimeras by transplanting PcTx1 bound to helix-5 from the complex structure (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</a>) into the X-ray structure of the Kv1.2/2.1 paddle chimera (<a href=\"#bib43\">Long et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1H\u2013Q</a>). As expected, several of the models predict steric clashes between PcTx1 and neighboring helices within the S1\u2013S4 domain, whereas in others the toxin could be readily accommodated when bound to helix-5. Even in this latter category of models, however, PcTx1 would need to partition relatively deeply into the membrane in order to bind to helix-5 in the chimeras, a possibility that seems unlikely given the relatively superficial interaction of the toxin we inferred with brominated lipids."

We generated Ala mutants for 29 out of 36 residues of GxTx-1E (excluding one native Ala and 6 Cys residues) using solid phase chemical synthesis, and successfully folded all but one in mg quantities (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). To determine the apparent affinity of toxin mutants for the resting state of Kv2.1, we obtained conductance (G)-voltage (V) relationships from negative holding voltages in the absence and presence of different concentrations of each mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>) and estimated fractional occupancy of the channel from the fractional inhibition for relatively weak depolarizations (\u221220 to 0 mV) where toxin bound channels do not open, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib67\">Swartz and MacKinnon, 1997a</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">1997b</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Li-Smerin and Swartz, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Milescu et al., 2009</a>). We obtained estimates of the apparent affinity for each mutant, and observed a wide range of different phenotypes, from small changes in affinity to almost 400-fold weakening of toxin affinity for Kv2.1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). When perturbation energies (\u2206\u2206G values) for each mutant were mapped onto the NMR structure of GxTx-1E, a well-defined surface of the toxin was identified where mutations having dramatic effects on the apparent affinity of the toxin cluster together (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This surface contains many aromatic residues (F7, W8, W9, Y22 and W28), one aliphatic hydrophobic residue (L30) and several polar residues (K10, K15, S25, K27 and N32). The mutations producing the most dramatic perturbations on this surface were for mutations of aromatic residues, whereas those for the polar residues were relatively modest (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

To verify that the surface we identified is involved in binding to Kv2.1, we investigated membrane interactions for each of the three Trp residues (W8, W9 and W28), positions where mutations have some of the largest perturbation energies. Even though the apparent affinities of these mutants for Kv2.1 ranged from 26 to almost 200-fold lower (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), we obtained K<sub>x</sub> values that were within a factor of two for the wild-type toxin (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also measured quenching of the three Trp mutants by brominated lipids and found that each exhibited robust quenching (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). It is notable that the blue-shifts observed with membrane partitioning vary for the three Trp mutants, as does the extent of quenching by brominated lipids (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that the three Trp residues reside in non-equivalent environments within the membrane. Taken together, these collective data with GxTx-1E mutants strongly support the notion that the active surface identified by mutagenesis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) is involved in binding to the voltage-sensing domain. To compare this surface of GxTx-1E with the binding surface of PcTx1, we calculated the change in <span class=\"underline\">s</span>olvent <span class=\"underline\">a</span>ccessible <span class=\"underline\">s</span>urface <span class=\"underline\">a</span>rea (\u0394SASA) of PcTx1 upon binding to ASIC1a, and compared it to the binding surface identified in GxTx-1E (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). The comparison reveals an extensive overlap between the active surfaces of the two toxins responsible for binding to ASIC1a and Kv2.1 channels, indicating that the two classes of toxins use related surfaces for interacting with helices within structurally unrelated ion channel proteins."

The recent X-ray structures of complexes between PcTx1 and ASIC1a indicates that the tarantula toxin binds to the channel in aqueous solution (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dawson et al., 2012</a>), whereas a growing body of work supports that idea that voltage-sensor toxins bind to voltage sensors within the lipid bilayer (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lee and MacKinnon, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alabi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Milescu et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Schmidt and MacKinnon, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bosmans et al., 2011a</a>). The results of our experiments demonstrate that both classes of toxins interact with membranes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 3</a>), a finding that is consistent with the amphipathic character evident in the solution structures of these toxins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). However, our results also show that the interaction of PcTx1 with membranes is different than what has been observed for voltage-sensor toxins. Fluorescence spectroscopy results show that Trp residues on PcTx1 exhibit only very small blue shifts when interacting with membranes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), and that the Trp fluorescence of the toxin is only weakly quenched by bromine atoms on the acyl chains of lipids (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In contrast, voltage-sensor toxins typically exhibit strong blue shifts in Trp fluorescence and this is robustly quenched by brominated lipids (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 3</a>). Although these properties have been consistently observed for other voltage-sensor toxins (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jung et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Milescu et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Swartz, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jung et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mihailescu et al., 2014</a>), the stark differences observed here for PcTx1 demonstrate that tarantula toxins of similar structure do not necessarily have similar membrane interacting properties. The membrane interactions of voltage-sensor toxins are unique in how far they can penetrate the lipid bilayer, further supporting the idea that this class of toxins interacts with voltage sensors within the lipid bilayer."

Although a complex structure of PcTx1 and ASIC shows that the PcTx1 binding site is located about 45 \u00c5 above from the lipid bilayer, superficial adsorption of the toxin to the membrane would be predicted to enhance the rate of complex formation due to a reduction in dimensionality of diffusion (<a href=\"#bib2\">Axelrod and Wang, 1994</a>). Interestingly, membrane interactions have also been reported for charybdotoxin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ben-Tal et al., 1997</a>), a strongly cationic scorpion toxin that blocks the external pore of some potassium channels (<a href=\"#bib52\">Miller, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Banerjee et al., 2013</a>). The interaction of charybdotoxin with membranes is heavily influenced by electrostatic interactions, suggesting that the toxin interacts relatively superficially, similar to what we observed with PcTx1. The superficial nature of the interaction between either PcTx1 or charybdotoxin and lipid membranes could be important because it would allow these toxins to departition rapidly so that it can bind to its receptor above the membrane, or possibly to explore the protein surface as an extension of the membrane surface. The voltage-sensor toxins, in contrast, must bind to helices embedded within the membrane, and thus must venture deeper into the lipid bilayer."

However, our results show that GxTx-1E uses a surface to bind to the S3b helix within voltage sensors that is similar to that which PcTx1 uses to bind to helix-5 in ASIC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), even though the former binds within a membrane environment and the latter in aqueous solution. The underlying rationale for using common surfaces is likely related to the fact that both GxTx-1E and PcTx1 bind directly to \u03b1-helices. The X-ray structure of PcTx1 in complex with ASIC shows that the toxin clamps onto a solvent-exposed lateral surface of helix-5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dawson et al., 2012</a>), using a somewhat concave surface of the toxin formed by residues in loop 1 and loop 3, including both hydrophobic (W7, W24, F30, and P35) and polar residues (K8, K25, R26, S29 and T37). The equivalent surface of GxTx-1E is also formed by residues in loop 1 and loop 3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), which contain a similar variety of hydrophobic (F7, W8, W9, Y22, W28 and L30) and polar residues (K10, K15, S25, K27 and N32) where mutations weaken the apparent affinity of the toxin. This surface is also similar to that identified on SGTx1 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Milescu et al., 2007</a>), a tarantula toxin related to hanatoxin and GxTx-1E that inhibits the Kv2.1 channel. Although the apparent affinity of the most critical mutants on SGTx1 could not be accurately determined because the affinity of the toxin is quite low (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2004</a>), residues having disproportionately large effects on the apparent affinity of the toxin compared to the strength of membrane partitioning cluster together on a surface that is similar to what we identified here for GxTx-1E (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Milescu et al., 2007</a>). Given the similar binding faces for \u03b1-helices on 3 peptide toxins that share little commonality besides an tri-cystine scaffold, we suggest that this face of the ICK fold forms a shape complement (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jones, 2012</a>) for \u03b1-helices that may be exploited by many other peptide ligands."

We constructed five models where the toxin-helix interaction occurs in different registers in the S3b helix, similar to what we did in making the helix-5/paddle chimera models, and identified three models where the toxin could be accommodated without steric clashes with the channel (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). Although all three models position critical residues on GxTx-1E where they can interact with the S3b helix, our preferred model (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1E, 2E</a>) positions the largest number of critical residues in GxTx-1E where they can interact with residues in the S3b helix. In addition, in this model the toxin interacts with many of the most critical residues within the S3b helix that have been identified using mutagenesis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Swartz and MacKinnon, 1997b</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Li-Smerin and Swartz, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Milescu et al., 2009</a>), with a placement of the toxin within the membrane that is compatible with the depth of partitioning inferred using spectroscopic and neutron diffraction approaches (<a href=\"#bib56\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jung et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mihailescu et al., 2014</a>). Voltage-sensor toxins like GxTx-1E bind tighter to and stabilize the resting/closed state of Kv channels, however, they can remain bound when the voltage sensors activate and the channel opens (<a href=\"#bib56\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tilley et al., 2014</a>). Thus, although our preferred model of GxTx-1E bound to the activated/open Kv1.2/Kv2.1 paddle chimera represents the toxin bound to a lower affinity activated state of the Kv channel, it nicely illustrates how GxTx-1E could interact with the S3b helix in ways that closely resemble what is seen in the X-ray structure of PcTx1 bound to ASIC. In the future it will be interesting to refine models of the complex by attempting to form bridges between toxin and channel, and ultimately solving structures of these fascinating complexes."

The linear precursor was synthesized using solid-phase methodology with Fmoc chemistry, starting from Fmoc-Pro-Wang resin (Fmoc-Thr-Wang resin for PcTx1) using a variety of blocking groups for the protection of the amino acids. All the GxTx1E peptides were synthesized with norleucine (Nle) in place of Met35 to avoid oxidation of the toxin. A 4 mol excess of Fmoc amino acid, DIC, and Cl-HOBt were used for amino acid activation. After trifluoroacetic acid cleavage, the crude linear peptide was extracted with 2 M acetic acid and diluted to a final concentration of 25 \u00b5M in a solution containing 0.1 M ammonium acetate, 1 M guanidine-HCl and 2.5 mM reduced/0.25 mM oxidized glutathione (pH 8.0 with aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>OH) and stirred slowly at 4\u00b0C for 3 days. The folding reaction was monitored with RP-HPLC and the crude oxidized product was purified by preparative RP-HPLC with a C18 silica column. The purity of the synthetic PcTx1, GxTx1E and the Ala mutants was confirmed by analytical RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF-MS measurements. The concentration of the toxin was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using calculated extinction coefficients (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gill and von Hippel, 1989</a>)."

All experiments were performed at room temperature (\u223c22\u00b0C). Voltage-activations relationships in the absence and presence of different concentrations of the synthesized toxin were recorded. The inhibitory activity of the synthetic toxins were examined against the Kv2.1 channel by taking steady-state current measurements following weak depolarizations at 10-s intervals before, during and after addition of toxin to the recording chamber until the effect of the toxin on the channel reached equilibrium. At weak depolarizations, leak and endogenous current contributions to steady-state current levels were accounted for by using clampfit to subtract current before activation of the channels at those voltages.

The authors conclude that voltage-sensor toxins (GxTx-1E) partition deeper into the bilayer than PcTx1 which does not target voltage-sensors. Moreover, the authors suggest that both toxins have evolved a concave surface for interacting with alpha-helices whether this happens in aqueous or lipid environments. All investigators involved in this study are experts in their respective fields, which is reflected in the meticulous execution of the reported experiments. Altogether, this manuscript does a good job at convincing the reader of the author's conclusions. The manuscript is well written and well-referenced. The strongest and most important contribution to the field is that tarantula toxins of similar structure do not necessarily have similar membrane interacting properties which may reflect on their channel selectivity/potency properties."

The weak nature of the interaction of SGTx1 with more mammalian-like membranes led us to conclude that membrane partitioning will not lead to large increases in the toxin concentration within the membrane, but would certainly be sufficient for the toxin to access its receptor (the voltage-sensing domains) within the membrane."

In response to the final point above, we examined the interaction between membrane vesicles and charybdotoxin, a pore-blocking scorpion toxin that contains one Trp residue surrounded by basic residues, which we suspected might not interact with membranes. However, we observed measurable (but small) blue shifts in Trp fluorescence, suggesting that charybdotoxin does interact with membranes. Moreover, a previous study investigated the interaction of radiolabeled charybdotoxin with membrane vesicles and the toxin was found to interact with membranes through an electrostatic mechanism (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ben-Tal et al., 1997</a>, Biophysical J. 73, 1717-1727.)
