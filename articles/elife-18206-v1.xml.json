However, a role for the CNS in the regulation of metabolism in the context of the exercise remains less clear. Here, using genetically engineered mice we assessed the requirement of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) expression in neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) in mediating the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism. We found that VMH-specific deletion of SF-1 blunts (a) the reductions in fat mass, (b) improvements in glycemia, and (c) increases in energy expenditure that are associated with exercise training. Unexpectedly, we found that SF-1 deletion in the VMH attenuates metabolic responses of skeletal muscle to exercise, including induction of PGC-1\u03b1 expression. Collectively, this evidence suggests that SF-1 expression in VMH neurons is required for the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism."

However, a role for the CNS in the regulation of metabolism in the context of the exercise remains less clear. Here, using genetically engineered mice we assessed the requirement of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) expression in neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) in mediating the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism. We found that VMH-specific deletion of SF-1 blunts (a) the reductions in fat mass, (b) improvements in glycemia, and (c) increases in energy expenditure that are associated with exercise training. Unexpectedly, we found that SF-1 deletion in the VMH attenuates metabolic responses of skeletal muscle to exercise, including induction of PGC-1\u03b1 expression. Collectively, this evidence suggests that SF-1 expression in VMH neurons is required for the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism."

Exercise can be an effective lifestyle intervention to combat obesity and metabolic diseases (<a href=\"#bib20\">Handschin and Spiegelman, 2008</a>). Moreover, the combined efficacy of exercise and dietary regimens on type two diabetes can surpass that of pharmacological interventions alone (<a href=\"#bib31\">Knowler et al., 2002</a>). Previous efforts aimed at identifying molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptive responses to exercise have mainly focused on the effects of exercise training in an organ or cell autonomous manner (<a href=\"#bib16\">Egan and Zierath, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hawley et al., 2014</a>). Despite the increased understanding of the importance of the CNS underlying metabolic homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gautron et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Morton et al., 2014</a>), the specific neuronal groups and pathways that contribute to the metabolic responses during and following exercise remain largely unclear."

In particular, the ventral medial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) and the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1; official gene name <i>Nr5a1</i>) are critical for the regulation of metabolism (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheung et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Parker et al., 2002</a>). Within the brain, SF-1 is expressed within the VMH and several studies have demonstrated that SF-1-expressing neurons (SF-1 neurons), and SF-1 itself, are required for adaptive responses to metabolic challenges that occur with high-fat diet (HFD) feeding (<a href=\"#bib9\">Choi et al., 2013</a>). VMH-specific deletions of SF-1 and other genes such as <i>Sirt1</i>, <i>Slc17a6</i>, and <i>Esr1</i> blunt the adaptive thermogenic response to HFD (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ramadori et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Xu et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, these deletions had modest effects in chow-fed mice (<a href=\"#bib9\">Choi et al., 2013</a>). These data suggest that SF-1 in the VMH may regulate a transcriptional program required for responding to metabolic challenges such as HFD-feeding. Exercise is a robust metabolic challenge. We therefore postulated that SF-1 expression in the VMH may also be essential for mediating the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism. To test our hypothesis, we produced mice with VMH-specific deletions of SF-1 and assessed several metabolic parameters following exercise training."

Echocardiography revealed normal cardiac function, and function of isolated mitochondria from skeletal muscle were not impaired in VMH<sup>\u2206SF-1</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013E</a>). Previous studies have shown that blockade of VMH neuronal activity reduces circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) during and after exercise (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miyaki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Scheurink et al., 1988</a>), and FFA utilization during exercise (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miyaki et al., 2011</a>). FFAs are a critical energy resource for endurance exercise (<a href=\"#bib24\">Horowitz, 2003</a>), and disruption of FFA mobilization can impede endurance capacity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dub\u00e9 et al., 2015</a>). FFAs between control and VMH<sup>\u2206SF-1</sup> mice were comparable in sedentary mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). In contrast, several species of circulating FFAs in VMH<sup>\u2206SF-1</sup> mice were significantly lower (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) following a single exercise bout (15 m/min for 60 min, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). These data suggest that VMH<sup>\u2206SF-1</sup> mice have an impaired mobilization of FFAs in response to exercise, which may contribute to their reduced endurance capacity."

To directly test this, we assessed the metabolic rate in chow-fed mice after prolonged exercise training (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>).

While lean mass was significantly correlated with oxygen consumption in all genotypes (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we unexpectedly found that exercised-VMH<sup>\u2206SF-1</sup> mice had significantly less lean mass compared to exercised-control mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013H</a>). These results suggest that the reduction in lean mass may underlie the failure of VMH<sup>\u2206SF-1</sup> mice to increase energy expenditure in response to exercise. Moreover, this reduction may also blunt other beneficial effects of exercise. Predictably, we found that exercise-induced increases in relative skeletal muscle mass (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>) in control mice. The improvements in relative skeletal muscle mass (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>),\u00a0body composition, and circulating glucose levels were impaired in VMH<sup>\u2206SF-1</sup> mice compared to control mice (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To assess whether deletion of SF-1 in the VMH alters sympathetic nervous system activity in response to exercise, we measured circulating catecholamines immediately after a single bout of exercise. Circulating levels of norepinephrine, glucagon and insulin were not significantly different between groups (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>).

For example, PGC-1\u03b1-4 has been predicted to contribute to skeletal muscle adaptations following exercise (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ruas et al., 2012</a>). We found that exercise-induced expression of total <i>Ppargc1a</i> and <i>Ppargc1a</i>-2 in muscle was blunted in VMH<sup>\u2206SF-1</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). PGC-1\u03b1-2 was impaired in exercised-VMH<sup>\u2206SF-1</sup> mice, suggesting that the reduction in total <i>Ppargc1a</i> expression levels is due to changes in <i>Ppargc1a</i>-2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). We also examined mRNA expression levels of <i>Myog, Myod1, Fbxo32,</i> and <i>Ctsl</i>, all of which regulate protein synthesis and degradation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sandri et al., 2006</a>).

In particular, our date supports a model predicting that SF-1 in the VMH is required for the metabolic adaptations to exercise training, including increasing metabolic rate, skeletal muscle mass, and decreased adiposity. Previous lines of evidence also support a role for the VMH in regulating the metabolic responses to exercise. For example, stimulation of the VMH enhances lipolysis in white adipose tissues and facilitates fatty acid oxidation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ruffin and Nicolaidis, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Takahashi and Shimazu, 1981</a>). Blockade of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2AdRs) in the VMH impedes the increase in circulating fatty acids during exercise (<a href=\"#bib52\">Scheurink et al., 1988</a>). Moreover, microinjections of the anesthetic lidocaine or \u03b2AdR antagonists into the VMH inhibits fatty acid oxidation during exercise (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miyaki et al., 2011</a>). Of note, suppression of neuronal activity in the VMH apparently does not affect metabolism under sedentary conditions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miyaki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Takahashi and Shimazu, 1981</a>). Collectively, our findings indicate that SF-1 in the VMH is required for the full adaptive response to exercise training."

For instance, microinjection of leptin or orexin into the VMH increases glucose uptake in skeletal muscle via the SNS (<a href=\"#bib21\">Haque et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shiuchi et al., 2009</a>). Although the precise circuitry downstream of the VMH remains to be determined, genetic tracing has revealed that SF-1 neurons project to regions of the brain that control activity of the autonomic nervous system including the parabrachial nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract and the rostral ventrolateral medulla (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lindberg et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that optogenetic photostimulation of SF-1 neurons rapidly alters heart rate (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>), further suggesting that SF-1 may regulate autonomic function. Collectively, these studies suggest that SF-1 neurons act on the SNS to regulate metabolism in the skeletal muscle and other peripheral tissues, and impaired SNS activity may underlie the blunted response in adiposity, skeletal muscle and metabolic rate to exercise training in VMH<sup>\u2206SF-1</sup> mice."

Our data indicate that deletion of SF-1 in the VMH specifically attenuates the activation of CREB, a downstream signaling target of PKA, in skeletal muscle following exercise (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Intriguingly, CREB can regulate the expression levels of PGC-1\u03b1, a major regulator of skeletal muscle oxidative function and a potential regulator of muscle growth (<a href=\"#bib20\">Handschin and Spiegelman, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ruas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sandri et al., 2006</a>).

Forkhead box protein O1 (Foxo1) is a terminal downstream molecule of the PI3K signaling pathway, and is translocated from the nucleus to cytosol upon PI3K activation (<a href=\"#bib61\">Van Der Heide et al., 2004</a>). Interestingly, we previously found that deletion of Foxo1 in the VMH increases SF-1 mRNA levels in the hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that PI3K signaling regulates SF-1 expression levels in the VMH in vivo. While studies suggest that exercise can activate PI3K signaling in the hypothalamus after exercise training (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chiarreotto-Ropelle et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>), it remains unclear whether this occurs specifically in SF-1 neurons. Exercise training also increases several neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus, including BDNF, which activate the PI3K signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cotman et al., 2007</a>). Exercise has been shown to induce BDNF levels in the mediobasal hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib56\">Takimoto and Hamada, 2014</a>). In addition, we demonstrated that exercise training can increase mRNA expression of SF-1 and putative SF-1 target genes in the mediobasal hypothalamus (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These studies support a model predicting exercise increases the\u00a0activity of PI3K signaling pathways in the hypothalamus (including VMH neurons), which modulates the\u00a0SF-1 activity and increases expression of SF-1 target genes.

To isolate mitochondria, TA skeletal muscle tissues were homogenized using a motorized Dounce homogenizer in ice-cold MSHE buffer (70 mM sucrose, 210 mM mannitol, 5 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA) containing 0.5% FA-free BSA. Homogenates then underwent low centrifugation (800 g for 10 min) to remove nuclei and cell debris, followed by high centrifugation (8000 g for 10 min) to obtain the mitochondrial pellet, which was washed once in ice-cold MSHE buffer and was resuspended in a minimal amount of MSHE buffer prior to determination of protein concentrations using a BCA assay (Life technology). Oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) were determined using the XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, MA) following the manufacturers\u2019 protocols. For the electron-flow (EF) experiments, isolated TA skeletal muscle mitochondria were seeded at 10 \u03bcg of protein per well in XF24 V7 cell-culture microplates (Seahorse Bioscience), then pelleted by centrifugation (2000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C) in 1X MAS buffer (70 mM sucrose, 220 mM mannitol, 10 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA in 0.2% FA-free BSA; pH 7.2) supplemented with 10 mM pyruvate, 10 mM malate and 4 \u03bcM carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (for EF experiments), with a final volume of 500 \u03bcl per well. For electron-coupling (EC) experiments, 1X MAS buffer was supplemented with 10 mM succinate and 2 \u03bcM rotenone. The XF24 plate was then transferred to a temperature-controlled (37\u00b0C) Seahorse analyzer and subjected to a 10 min equilibration period and two assay cycles to measure the basal rate, comprising a 30 s mix, and a 3 min measure period each; and compounds were added by automatic pneumatic injection followed by a single assay cycle after each; comprising a 30 s mix and 3 min measure period. For EF experiments, OCR measurements were obtained following sequential additions of rotenone (2 \u03bcM final concentration), succinate (10 mM), antimycin A (4 \u03bcM) and ascorbate (10 mM) (the latter containing 1 mM N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine [TMPD]). For EC experiments, OCR measurements were obtained post sequential additions of ADP (4 mM), oligomycin (2 \u03bcM), FCCP (4 \u03bcM) and antimycin-A (2 \u03bcM). OCR measurements were recorded at set interval time-points."

They find that many of the beneficial effects are blunted in mice with genetic disruption of the Nr5a1 gene (that encodes Sf-1) in CamKII-expressing neurons. The authors find that the increases in mass of various muscles after chronic exercise is blunted in the mice lacking SF-1 and suggest that defects in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) outflow to muscle is likely responsible. Although the authors do not directly examine SNS activity in this study, there is a large body of data implicating the VMH and SF-1-expressing neurons in particular in control of SNS. The design of the experiments is sound, but there are some aspects of the study that are inconsistent and other aspects that require some explanation."

This is certainly the case in human studies. However, as outlined below rodent studies are difficult to interpret in this regard. The type of exercise adaptation is dependent on a number of factors such as mode, duration, intensity, and frequency of exercise. Treadmill training in mice is a weight bearing exercise. Therefore, obese-exercised mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) have ~25% lower body weight compared to obese-sedentary mice, and thus require less muscle mass to support normal cage activity and exercise. Furthermore, the exercised mice have improved body composition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

This degree of intensity on a treadmill apparatus is not expected to result in significant gain of lean mass. Indeed, we found that this training protocol improved body composition in chow-fed mice by maintaining lean mass while reducing fat mass (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B, C</a>). We chose to express skeletal muscle weight relative to total body weight (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) to account for differences in body weight, as increased body mass can increase lean mass.

Accordingly, we have performed additional studies in this regard. <i>Nr4a2, Crem, Foxo1</i>, and <i>Smad3</i>, are regulated by epinephrine, \u03b22AdR-agonist administration, or exercise (Catoire et al., 2012; Egan et al., 2013; Pearen et al., 2009; Viguerie et al., 2004). mRNA levels of these genes were measured after a single exercise session as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4F-J</a>. Although no statistical differences in gene expression were found between genotypes, exercised-KO mice did have higher mRNA levels of <i>Crem</i> compared to exercised-control mice. <i>Crem</i> is reported to reciprocally regulate CREB target genes in the skeletal muscle (Viguerie et al., 2004) (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5A-D</a>). This result, along with our data showing that phosphorylation of CREB in skeletal muscle of KO mice is blunted in response to exercise (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), suggests that deletion of SF-1 in the VMH affects the CREB signaling pathway."

Compared to sedentary-KO mice, exercised-KO mice had significantly higher levels of <i>Myog</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5E</a>), and higher, but not significant, levels of <i>Fbxo32</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5G</a>). Gene expression remained unchanged in control mice. We speculate that deletion of SF-1 in the hypothalamus may disrupt protein turnover, ultimately causing a maladaptation of skeletal muscle in response to exercise as seen in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>."

                    "text": "The reviewer raises an excellent point, and we have now addressed this concern. We found no statistical differences in circulating glucagon and insulin immediately after a single bout of exercise (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C and D</a>). In line with other studies (Galbo et al., 1975; Rowell et al., 1987; Soya et al., 2007), our exercise paradigm (15m/min for 60 minutes) did not dramatically increase circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine levels (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). However, epinephrine levels of KO mice were significantly lower after exercise compared to control mice. As the reviewers know, obtaining unstressed levels of plasma catecholamines in mice is inherently difficult. Thus, as an additional measure of sympathetic nervous system activity, we assessed the transcriptional activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the adrenal medulla of exercised mice. In particular, we quantified pre-mRNA (intronic) TH mRNA levels in the adrenal grand as a surrogate marker of sympathetic nervous activity (Yamamoto et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2002). Interestingly, exercise increased pre-mRNA levels of TH in the adrenal gland of control mice, but not in KO mice (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). Collectively, we think our data suggest support the model that deletion of SF-1 in the VMH hampers the ability of VMH-adrenal gland-axis of the sympathetic nervous system to respond to exercise."
