In this study, we present an intriguing counter-example by demonstrating that in the center of the human ocular lens, there is no lipid turnover in fiber cells during the entire human lifespan. This discovery, combined with prior demonstration of pronounced changes in the lens lipid composition over a lifetime (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hughes et al., 2012</a>), suggests that some lipid classes break down in the body over several decades, whereas others are stable. Such substantial changes in lens cell membranes may play a role in the genesis of age-related eye disorders. Whether long-lived lipids are present in other tissues is not yet known, but this may prove to be important in understanding the development of age-related diseases."

In this study, we present an intriguing counter-example by demonstrating that in the center of the human ocular lens, there is no lipid turnover in fiber cells during the entire human lifespan. This discovery, combined with prior demonstration of pronounced changes in the lens lipid composition over a lifetime (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hughes et al., 2012</a>), suggests that some lipid classes break down in the body over several decades, whereas others are stable. Such substantial changes in lens cell membranes may play a role in the genesis of age-related eye disorders. Whether long-lived lipids are present in other tissues is not yet known, but this may prove to be important in understanding the development of age-related diseases."

The lens grows throughout life by adding new cells to the outside of the lens, but the center of the lens\u2014also known as the lens nucleus\u2014contains the same cells that were present at birth.

This doesn't affect the molecules, as carbon-14 works just like normal carbon.

This revealed that the proportion of carbon-14 in the total carbon content of the lipids in the nucleus could be used to accurately predict the year of birth of the donor. Therefore, the lipids in your lenses when you are born remain with you for your entire life. This finding could help us to understand age-related sight disorders, such as cataracts. Further research could also investigate whether there are any similarly long-lasting lipids in other body tissues, and whether these affect how other age-related diseases develop."

However, in tissues where access to the metabolic machinery for membrane renewal is restricted, it is possible that some lipids are longer lived but this has never been shown. If long-lived lipids are present, the properties of the tissues in which they are incorporated may be influenced by the decomposition or modification of the lipidome over time. One tissue that can be used to examine this hypothesis is the ocular lens. There is no cellular turnover in the human lens (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lynnerup et al., 2008</a>) and its center\u2014a region known as the nucleus\u2014is devoid of cellular organelles (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bassnett and Beebe, 1992</a>)."

This approach exploits the global pulse of artificial atmospheric <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> resulting from above-ground testing of nuclear weapons that occurred from 1955 until 1963 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Libby et al., 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Harkness and Walton, 1972</a>). The concentration of <sup>14</sup>C has decreased exponentially from 1963 until the present day due to the exchange of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in the oceans and biosphere. The lens grows continuously throughout life by the addition of fiber cells to a pre-existing lens that was present at birth (the nucleus) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lynnerup et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, in the absence of turnover of cellular components, the <sup>14</sup>C level of an individual's lens nucleus reflects the <sup>14</sup>C abundance of the year in which they were born. If turnover occurs rapidly, <sup>14</sup>C abundance reflects current levels present in the atmosphere, while an intermediate value would suggest a slower rate of exchange. Given this information, measurement of the amount of <sup>14</sup>C present in a class of biomolecules allows the determination of the date of biosynthesis and the time the system ceased exchanging carbon with its surroundings, or the rate of exchange with its surroundings."

In human lenses, sphingomyelins are more abundant than glycerophospholipids (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borchman et al., 1994</a>). The chemical stability of sphingomyelins is illustrated by the fact that they have been discovered, intact in a 40,000-year-old woolly mammoth (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kreps et al., 1979</a>). Furthermore, the higher degree of saturation found in sphingomyelins present in the human lens (i.e., predominantly dihydrosphingomyelins), may confer unique chemical and physical stability to the membranes of lens fiber cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Yappert and Borchman, 2004</a>)."

Nevertheless, we did collect some preliminary data from a single human lens cortex and found that the f<sup>14</sup>C levels corresponded to an approximate average of the individual\u2019s lifespan.
