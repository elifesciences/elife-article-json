                    "text": "HIV-1 infection cannot be cured because the virus persists as integrated proviral DNA in long-lived cells despite years of suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). In a previous paper (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zanini et al, 2015</a>) we documented HIV-1 evolution in 10 untreated patients. Here we characterize establishment, turnover, and evolution of viral DNA reservoirs in the same patients after 3\u201318 years of suppressive ART. A median of 14% (range 0\u201342%) of the DNA sequences were defective due to G-to-A hypermutation. Remaining DNA sequences showed no evidence of evolution over years of suppressive ART. Most sequences from the DNA reservoirs were very similar to viruses actively replicating in plasma (RNA sequences) shortly before start of ART. The results do not support persistent HIV-1 replication as a mechanism to maintain the HIV-1 reservoir during suppressive therapy. Rather, the data indicate that DNA variants are turning over as long as patients are untreated and that suppressive ART halts this turnover."

In a previous paper (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zanini et al, 2015</a>) we documented HIV-1 evolution in 10 untreated patients. Here we characterize establishment, turnover, and evolution of viral DNA reservoirs in the same patients after 3\u201318 years of suppressive ART. A median of 14% (range 0\u201342%) of the DNA sequences were defective due to G-to-A hypermutation. Remaining DNA sequences showed no evidence of evolution over years of suppressive ART. Most sequences from the DNA reservoirs were very similar to viruses actively replicating in plasma (RNA sequences) shortly before start of ART. The results do not support persistent HIV-1 replication as a mechanism to maintain the HIV-1 reservoir during suppressive therapy. Rather, the data indicate that DNA variants are turning over as long as patients are untreated and that suppressive ART halts this turnover."

ART very effectively suppresses active virus replication, but it cannot eradicate the infection because HIV-1 persists as integrated proviral DNA in long-lived cells that constitute a virus reservoir. Latently infected resting memory CD4+ T-lymphocytes (memory CD4 cells) represent the most solidly documented HIV-1 reservoir (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eriksson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chun et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">1995</a>). Fully functional integrated HIV-1 proviruses are present in a small fraction of memory CD4 cells. These cells do not produce virus when they are in a resting state, but can be induced to produce virus upon activation in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eriksson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chun et al., 1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Massanella and Richman, 2016</a>). The activation state of the infected cell and the viral encoded Tat feedback loop jointly determine latency and virus production (<a href=\"#bib31\">Razooky et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rouzine et al., 2015</a>)."

The quantitative virus outgrowth assay (QVOA) has been the \u2018gold standard\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib40\">von Stockenstrom et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Massanella and Richman, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bruner et al., 2015</a>), but recent studies have revealed that this assay greatly underestimates the true size of the functional reservoir (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ho et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bruner et al., 2016</a>). In contrast, PCR-based assays overestimate the size of the functional reservoir because they cannot distinguish between replication-competent and defective viral genomes (<a href=\"#bib40\">von Stockenstrom et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Massanella and Richman, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bruner et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2016</a>). Many defective proviruses contain large internal deletions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ho et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sanchez et al., 1997</a>). Defective proviruses also result from APOBEC editing, which induces G-to-A hypermutation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Yu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kieffer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Stopak et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bruner et al., 2016</a>)."

Similarly, HIV-1 DNA levels and genetic compositions are very stable in patients receiving long-term suppressive ART (<a href=\"#bib40\">von Stockenstrom et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Besson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Josefsson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kearney et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">G\u00fcnthard et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Evering et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kieffer et al., 2004</a>).

This excess of late variants in the DNA reservoirs indicated that proviral HIV-1 variants continued to turn over with a half-life of approximately one year until the patients began therapy.

We defined viral DNA reservoirs as HIV-1 p17gag sequences that were still present in PBMCs after at least 2 years of suppressive ART.

Identical p17gag sequences were merged into haplotypes while preserving their abundance. Minor haplotypes were merged with major haplotypes if they differed by one mutation (see Materials and methods section). Processed sequence data are available at hiv.tuebingen.mpg.de.

The short-lived cells will die within a few months of therapy, and the HIV-1 DNA will be dominated by infected cells with longer life spans (red). The HIV-1 DNA in these cells will contain a larger fraction of sequences corresponding to virus that replicated earlier during the course of the infection. This shift in the cell populations can result in a false signal of evolution (Panel B). This illustration assumes that 90% of the infected cells were short-lived (half-life of 21 days). The remaining 10% of the cells were assigned a half-life of 350 days. To mimic the HIV-1 DNA samples obtained from the cells sampled at 0, 3, and 6 months after initiation of ART (the sampling times used by\u00a0<a href=\"#bib24\">Lorenzo-Redondo et al.

From these sequences, we calculated the <i>apparent</i> divergence of the pseudo-samples at 3 and 6 months from the pseudo-sample taken when the ART was started. There was large variation in this <i>backward evolution</i> signal among patients. Averaged over patients, the observed shift corresponded to a rate of evolution of 0.0025 substitutions per year."

It is possible that the reported temporal signal arises from changes in DNA reservoir composition during the first 6 months of therapy when short-lived cells infected with recently replicating virus variants gradually disappear. Death of short-lived cells increases the proportions of longer-lived cells that sample further back into the history of the infection. This scenario (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) would result in sequence changes that do not indicate (forward) evolution.

The absence of provirus evolution or turnover does not fully exclude the possibility that there was replication and evolution of replication-competent viruses present in the reservoirs. However, if such replication occurred, it involved a minority of infected cells and occurred below the detection limit of the deep-sequencing method. To enrich for replication-competent and putatively evolving virus, QVOA followed by sequencing of virus released into the supernatant should be performed, not sequencing the total HIV-1 DNA (as done by <a href=\"#bib24\">Lorenzo-Redondo et al.

In contrast, <a href=\"#bib13\">Frenkel et al. (2003)</a> reported the persistence of greater numbers of earlier versus more recent virus variants in a few children receiving suppressive ART. We found a similar, but much less prominent, presence of variants replicating during the first 6 months post-infection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, panel B). These early variants were overrepresented relative to the expected level if deposition had been uniform over time. This overrepresentation could be due to the high viral load present during primary HIV-1 infection and is consistent with results by <a href=\"#bib3\">Bruner et al.

Similar to the sequencing of T-cell receptors, these labels can be used to track the fates of the memory CD4 cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Robins, 2013</a>). This strategy was used by <a href=\"#bib18\">Imamichi et al. (2014)</a>, who found that a T-cell clone carrying a defective HIV-1 provirus can persist for &gt;17 years. Similarly, prenatally formed T-cell receptors shared by twins have lifetimes that are &gt;30 years (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pogorelyy et al., 2016</a>). Our results are consistent with such long T-cell life times once HIV replication is suppressed by ART. In untreated infection, however, we estimate much faster turnover of infected cells with a half-life of approximately one year. This conclusion is based on the observation that most HIV-1 DNA sequences derive from replicating virus shortly before the start of ART. The results of earlier studies, which were based on different types of CD4 cell labelling, have indicated that CD4 cell die at a 3- to 4-fold increased rate in untreated HIV-1-infected patients, compared with uninfected individuals and with patients receiving suppressive ART (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hellerstein et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">McCune et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ribeiro et al., 2002</a>).

We did not sort cells and therefore could not investigate whether there were differences in HIV-1 turnover rates between different types and subsets of cells (e.g., memory CD4 cells and their subsets). However, it is reasonable to assume that most of our HIV-1 DNA sequences were from memory CD4+ T-lymphocytes because others have found that these cells are the main HIV-1 reservoir (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eriksson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chun et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">1995</a>). Because we sequenced a relatively short region of the HIV-1 genome, we could not reliably distinguish between replication-competent and defective viruses. We did not find evidence of evolution in proviral DNA sequences, but we cannot rule out the possibility that a small subset of viruses was replicating and remained undetected among the many defective viruses. However, our analyses of the composition and turnover of the virus reservoir were aided by the fact that most of the viruses were defective because these proviruses acted as inert in vivo labels of CD4 cell clones. We observed large variations in the abundance of sequence haplotypes that likely indicate the presence of clonal expansions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Josefsson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">von Stockenstrom et al., 2015</a>), independent integrations of identical sequences, and resampling of the same original DNA templates during sequencing. Given our sequencing method, we could not determine the relative contributions of these mechanisms. We are using Primer ID sequencing (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jabara et al., 2011</a>) to better understand the in vivo dynamics of different viral haplotypes. Analysis of HIV integration sites represents an alternative method of clonal expansion identification (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maldarelli et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cohn et al., 2015</a>). However, such analysis was not possible for us because we did not sequence the extreme ends of the LTRs. We analyzed p17gag because it was part of our plasma HIV RNA dataset and because it has sufficient genetic diversity to allow for accurate and valid comparisons between plasma RNA and PBMC DNA HIV populations. Results from several analyses suggested that clonal expansion did not affect our results in a qualitative manner. Clonal expansion would have resulted in artefactual over-representation of some sequences. To control for this, we repeated the analyses in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a> and counted each haplotype only once. We obtained very similar results (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Consistent with our results and interpretation, <a href=\"#bib10\">Cohn et al.

For each sample, the number of HIV-1 DNA templates used for sequencing was roughly quantified in triplicate by limiting dilution using the same PCR conditions, three dilutions (usually 0.5 \u00b5g, 0.1 \u00b5g, 0.02 \u00b5g DNA), and Poisson statistics. The plasmids NL4-3 and SF162 were used for control experiments, which were performed to evaluate PCR-induced recombination. Equal proportions of the plasmids were spiked into human DNA and were amplified using the same PCR conditions as previously described. The results revealed that there was minimal PCR-induced recombination in this short amplicon."

To construct sequencing libraries, indices and sequencing primers were added in 12\u201315 cycles of additional PCR. The amplicons were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq instrument and 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0250 cycle kits. A total of 6500 to 190,000 (median 35,000) paired-end reads were generated per sample. The overlapping paired-end sequencing reads were merged to create synthetic reads spanning the entire p17gag amplicon. The nucleotide on the read with the higher quality score was used for the cases of disagreement between paired reads. We counted the numbers of times a particular p17gag sequence was observed, and performed subsequent analysis using read-abundance pairs. To reduce the effects of sequencing and PCR errors, we combined rare sequences (below frequency 0.002) with common sequences if they differed at no more than one position. Specifically, starting with the rarest sequences, we merged rare sequences with the most common sequence that was one base away. The cutoff value of 0.002 is the typical error frequency of the pipeline (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zanini et al., 2015</a>). Less than 1 in 1000 reads that began with the HIV specific primer sequence could not be assigned with confidence to the previously determined RNA sequences. Most of these reads mapped to the human genome. All analyses were performed using Python and the libraries NumPy, BioPython, and Matplotlib (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cock et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">van der Walt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hunter, 2007</a>).

You show that the virus continues to evolve until ART is started. During ART, there is no further evolution. This conclusion is consistent with many previous studies. Although most studies of HIV evolution during ART have concluded that ART stops viral replication and thus halts evolution, a recent Nature paper by Wolinsky and colleagues provided some evidence for continuing evolution. Thus, the current paper is timely. The issue is of particular importance with regard to finding a cure for HIV investigation. Most investigators believe that the real barrier to cure is a stable latent reservoir. However, the finding that evolution is still occurring during ART would suggest that an additional problem is inadequate suppression of viral replication. The demonstration that evolution is halted strongly favors the idea that reservoirs are the barrier to cure, not inadequate ART. For these reasons, we think that the paper is likely to be accepted, provided the following comments are addressed."

In our analyses we identified hypermutated sequences and performed analyses with and without these sequences, with very similar overall results (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and elsewhere). You correctly state that with our sequencing method with we cannot identify sequences with deletions outside of the p17gag target region. This is a limitation of our study that we address in the Discussion: \u201cBecause we sequenced a relatively short region of the HIV-1 genome, we could not reliably distinguish between replication-competent and defective viruses. We did not find evidence of evolution in proviral DNA sequences, but we cannot rule out the possibility that a small subset of viruses was replicating and remained undetected among the many defective viruses.\u201d However, apart from this caveat, the phylogenetic analyses actually are aided by defective proviruses because these sequences do not further evolve after integration. A sentence has been added to the Discussion to point this out: \u201cHowever, our analyses of the composition and turnover of the virus reservoir were aided by the fact that most of the viruses were defective because these proviruses acted as inert in vivo labels of CD4 cell clones.\u201d"

Recent estimates suggest rates that are 3 to 10-fold lower (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> in Alizon and Fraser, Retrovirology 2013 or Zanini et al. 2016) than those estimated for C2V5."

The authors should have done this analysis (see Maldarelli et al., 2014 or Cohn et al., 2015) to estimate the extent of expansion rather than leave that to speculation (even for a single patient where they assumed this was the top contribution). This would have taken out a major source of possible confusion. What if the sample prep or methodology are somehow dominated by clonal expansion which is why they don't capture any variation?</i> "

Clonal expansion would result in undue over-representation of a some sequences. To control against such expansion, we repeated the analysis in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a> counting every haplotype only once, regardless of how many reads with that sequence were recovered (see supplements to these figures). By ignoring the number of times a sequence was sampled, effects of clonal expansion and PCR biases are removed. The results on the root-to-tip distances and the likely origin of the sequences are largely unchanged. Furthermore, data by Cohn et al. show only a limited decrease of single integrations following the start of ART (from about 70% to 50%, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."
