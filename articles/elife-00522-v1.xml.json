Understanding quantitatively how regulatory systems convert input signals to appropriate outputs remains a challenge. For the first time, we successfully model <i>even skipped</i> (<i>eve</i>) stripes 2 and 3+7 across the entire fly embryo at cellular resolution. A straightforward statistical relationship explains how transcription factor (TF) concentrations define <i>eve</i>\u2019s complex spatial expression, without the need for pairwise interactions or cross-regulatory dynamics. Simulating thousands of TF combinations, we recover known regulators and suggest new candidates. Finally, we accurately predict the intricate effects of perturbations including TF mutations and misexpression. Our approach imposes minimal assumptions about regulatory function; instead we infer underlying mechanisms from models that best fit the data, like the lack of TF-specific thresholds and the positional value of homotypic interactions. Our study provides a general and quantitative method for elucidating the regulation of diverse biological systems."

Understanding quantitatively how regulatory systems convert input signals to appropriate outputs remains a challenge. For the first time, we successfully model <i>even skipped</i> (<i>eve</i>) stripes 2 and 3+7 across the entire fly embryo at cellular resolution. A straightforward statistical relationship explains how transcription factor (TF) concentrations define <i>eve</i>\u2019s complex spatial expression, without the need for pairwise interactions or cross-regulatory dynamics. Simulating thousands of TF combinations, we recover known regulators and suggest new candidates. Finally, we accurately predict the intricate effects of perturbations including TF mutations and misexpression. Our approach imposes minimal assumptions about regulatory function; instead we infer underlying mechanisms from models that best fit the data, like the lack of TF-specific thresholds and the positional value of homotypic interactions. Our study provides a general and quantitative method for elucidating the regulation of diverse biological systems."

However, given the cellular concentrations of transcription factors in a developing organism, it is not known if it is possible to accurately predict their effects on transcription.

To this end, through a combination of genomic, genetic, and molecular experiments, the field continues to accumulate considerable information documenting components of regulatory systems and regulator-target interactions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gerstein et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">The modENCODE Consortium, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</a>). At present however, many of these descriptions are qualitative. A major goal going forward is to interpret these data in a quantitative manner (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wilczynski and Furlong, 2010</a>): how do regulators and regulatory interactions convert input signals to the appropriate output expression pattern? In general, answering these questions remains a significant challenge. The experiments needed to probe regulatory functions in detail are technically demanding; moreover, many systems involve multiple layers of control that cannot be investigated within a single experimental set-up. Theoretical models can help advance experimental investigations by providing a framework for deriving general principles and developing testable hypotheses (<a href=\"#bib60\">Reeves et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Tomlin and Axelrod, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lewis, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Oates et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Davidson, 2010</a>). An effective model should be able to define and predict expression accurately by describing how and by how much regulators influence target gene expression (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hasty et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Segal and Widom, 2009</a>)."

It is thought that core promoter elements and chromatin structure provide general competence for transcription at transcription start sites (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lenhard et al., 2012</a>), whereas more distant enhancers up-regulate expression of genes under specific conditions (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bulger and Groudine, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ong and Corces, 2011</a>). A single gene can be regulated by multiple enhancers, each directing a portion of the overall gene expression pattern in space and time. Enhancers operate by binding TFs, which in turn recruit regulatory co-factors and/or interact directly with the core promoter where RNA polymerase acts (<a href=\"#bib73\">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</a>). A comprehensive model of transcriptional regulation would therefore include many factors, such as regulatory DNA sequence, DNA conformation, TF concentrations and nucleosome position among others (<a href=\"#bib67\">Segal and Widom, 2009</a>). However, many of the parameters in such a model are currently impossible to measure. In the absence of such measurements, a partial yet predictive model based on available data is still valuable."

Our goal is to make few assumptions about the underlying molecular mechanism. Instead, by generating models that predict experimental measurements as accurately as possible, we infer probable biological mechanisms and insights suggested by the parameters of the models. To achieve this, we focus on modeling the functional link between TF inputs and the resulting output (i.e., the \u2018regulatory input function\u2018). These models are specific to individual enhancers: they capture how genomic loci interpret TF concentrations to control the output expression level of their target genes. Though multiple previous modeling studies have explicitly included protein\u2013DNA interactions (e.g., in <i>Drosophila</i>, see <a href=\"#bib24\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Janssens et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Junion et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kazemian et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Segal et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Zinzen et al., 2009</a>), here, we choose to model the relationship between inputs and outputs directly as this offers several advantages. First and most importantly, this type of model encapsulates numerous relevant levels of biophysical interactions (i.e., TF-DNA, TF-TF, enhancer-promoter etc). Second, it enables us evaluate the utility of higher-order interactions between TFs, propose potential regulators and consider alternative hypotheses of experimental results. Third, in the context of developmental biology, it allows us to explore the minimal information required to define positional information in the early embryo. Finally, focusing on input and output measurements means that the approach is applicable to relatively uncharacterized systems, for instance where enhancer regions have not yet been identified, or in assessing the conservation of regulatory input functions between species (<a href=\"#bib84\">Wunderlich et al., 2012</a>)."

Each stripe is only a few nuclei wide and any regulatory input function of an enhancer must define at least two borders at a high level of precision. A number of well-characterized enhancers direct expression of the seven <i>eve</i> stripes individually or in pairs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goto et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Harding et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fujioka et al., 1999</a>). Here, we focus on the enhancers <i>eve 2</i> and <i>eve 3+7</i>, which have been shown to control stripe 2 and stripes 3 and 7 respectively (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goto et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Harding et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Stanojevic et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Small et al., 1992</a>, <a href=\"#bib71\">1996</a>). Many of the input TFs and their roles in regulating <i>eve</i> expression have been defined; however, there remain unexplained properties underlying their regulation. An advantage of modeling <i>eve</i> is that we can use the available information as independent validations of our ability to recover known regulators and predict the outcome of regulatory perturbations, while also producing new insights. It is notable that though there has been some success in simulating the simpler gap gene expression pattern and in predicting <i>eve</i> expression on a portion of the anteroposterior axis, modeling pair-rule expression accurately across the whole embryo has remained a significant challenge (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jaeger et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Janssens et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Papatsenko and Levine, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Segal et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kazemian et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kim et al., 2013</a>)."

We distinguish between protein and mRNA measurements by indicating the regulator name in italics for mRNA (e.g., <i>gt</i>) or normal case for protein (e.g., Gt). In contrast to <i>eve</i>, the expression profiles of these regulators were retained as continuous measurements because many of them are expressed in a graded fashion.

Like linear regression, a logistic model linearly combines the values of the independent variables to produce a prediction; but the linear predictor is further transformed by the logistic function to give the probability, <i>p</i>, of <i>eve</i> being ON (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> for a schematic of \u2018Methods\u2019). As in any regression model, the weight parameters are optimized so that the output shows the greatest agreement with the training data. The weight assigned to each TF indicates its regulatory role, with positive weights indicating activators and negative weights indicating repressors. Importantly, since each regulator in the linear combination has independent weight parameters, the model needs only relative concentration measurements. Models were trained for classification using the nuclei of the stripe(s) under consideration as well as all OFF nuclei in the embryo. It is important to note that although this can be viewed as a training step, the ability of the model to classify at this stage is of direct interest to us: do the regulators contain sufficient positional information to explain <i>eve</i> expression in the given stripe(s)? We then use the model to predict <i>eve</i> expression in every nucleus across the entire embryo using the concentrations of the relevant regulators within them. This step reveals the model\u2019s applicability across the whole embryo, rather than just for the nuclei that were used for training."

We tested a stepwise selection process, but found that it generally includes more regulators than necessary for a good visual fit (e.g., a stepwise selection procedure for <i>eve 2</i> with the Bayesian information criterion finds 11 regulators). The stopping point (i.e., the penalty for adding an extra parameter) is effectively arbitrary in this case, or at least difficult to determine a priori in a justifiable manner.

Our linear models reflect this apparent paradox: Bcd is highlighted as one of the most important TFs during regulator discovery in spite of consistently having a negative coefficient, but a model trained by excluding the anterior region of the embryo assigns Bcd an activating function (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

First, it is simpler: the quadratic requires only three regulators, compared to four in the linear model. Both models have five parameters, which include three shared regulators (Hb, <i>kni</i>, <i>tll</i>) and the intercept. Second, the quadratic model has more clearly defined stripe borders than the linear model. Third, the quadratic model is more robust to the choice of training data (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), indicating that it describes the regulatory relationship uniformly across the embryo: the model performs consistently whether it is trained on either of the two stripes, a restricted region around the lateral midline, or only on the stripes and their immediately neighboring nuclei. Finally, the quadratic model retains accurate expression of the stripes even when all 38 candidate regulators are included; by contrast the prediction from the linear model begins to fragment spatially, which suggests localized over-fitting."

First, we can assume that the Kni protein is ubiquitously expressed in the embryo at low concentrations, but that this is not reflected in the Virtual Embryo dataset; it is possible that in situ hybridization was not sufficiently sensitive for these low-level transcripts or that the protein has a slightly different profile to the <i>kni</i> mRNA. If we increase <i>kni</i> concentrations in the Virtual Embryo dataset by just 0.1 (\u223c10% of the maximum measured value across all time points), the retrained quadratic model predicts full extension between the stripes. The prediction for wild-type expression is not affected and this adjustment is sufficient for explaining both the <i>kni</i> mutant and the <i>eve 3+7</i> binding site mutations. Second, since this adjustment produces a model with identical coefficients (i.e., <i>\u03b2</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>) except for the intercept (i.e., <i>\u03b2</i><sub><i>0</i></sub>)\u2014which increases from \u22128.1 to \u22123.6\u2014we can change the intercept directly in the quadratic model. This adjustment is also sufficient to predict full extension between the stripes, though it alters the wild-type prediction slightly (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This change in the intercept corresponds to potential differences in expression between the endogenous gene and the transgenic reporter. For instance, the reporter might have a lower barrier to activation and be more efficiently transcribed relative to the endogenous enhancer. Alternatively, the mutations in the transgenic enhancer may have abolished Kni repression, but then introduced the binding of another weak, ubiquitous activator."

We simulated this indirect interaction by increasing Hb concentration in proportion to the relative loss of <i>kni</i>. Since Hb is an activator at low concentrations in the quadratic model, this indirect effect can drive <i>eve</i> expression between the stripes. This adjustment is not relevant to binding site mutants, but interestingly it does provide a tentative explanation for the partial retreat of <i>eve</i>\u2019s extension towards a wild-type expression pattern: as Hb concentrations increase over time, the TF eventually switches from an activator to a repressor of <i>eve</i> between the stripes (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Specifically, having as little as 0.15 of Hb (\u223c15% of maximal expression) in this region is sufficient for a good prediction of stripe 7. Next, we simulated the effects of having some residual Hb-binding sites in the enhancer, as a mutagenesis experiment may not abolish all binding (e.g., see <a href=\"#bib11\">Clyde et al., 2003</a> compared to <a href=\"#bib75\">Struffi et al., 2011</a>). A simple way to model this is to have the same low level of Hb activity as in the zygotic mutant, which produces a good prediction as just described. As an alternative, we also considered whether incomplete mutagenesis could affect Hb\u2019s dual-regulatory behavior. <a href=\"#bib56\">Papatsenko and Levine (2008)</a> proposed that the dual role is facilitated by adjacently bound Hb molecules masking each other\u2019s active sites; in this scenario, we would expect dual regulation to be attenuated as binding sites are lost through mutagenesis. We simulated this by dampening the regulatory effect of Hb at higher concentrations and found that the predicted expression patterns agree with experimental results (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

First, our models are highly accurate in fitting the <i>eve</i> expression pattern in the entire embryo. This is in part because we chose to model the regulatory function of each enhancer separately, rather than fitting a single model that applies across many enhancers simultaneously. By defining parameters that are specific for each enhancer, we are able to assign the regulatory roles for TFs in a context-specific manner. Second, our models also perform well because, unlike previous studies, we do not impose any biological mechanisms on our models (e.g., a \u2018thermodynamic score\u2019 for protein\u2013DNA interactions). Instead we worked the other way round: we tested models that fit data as accurately as possible and then inferred the underlying mechanisms. This simple framework nonetheless allows us to propose experimentally testable hypotheses. Third, our modeling framework is quick to apply. This allowed us to search comprehensively for informative regulators, a property that is particularly valuable for studying poorly characterized enhancers."

Early work on positional information in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo was inspired by the idea of a morphogen gradient that is interpreted by the nuclei according to a set threshold (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ashe and Briscoe, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Crick, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wolpert, 1969</a>, <a href=\"#bib82\">1996</a>). More recently, it has been concluded that a lone-acting morphogen is insufficient for providing precise positional information to the embryo, especially since no gradient with this characteristic has been measured in an embryo (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kerszberg and Wolpert, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wolpert, 2011</a>). Our model, however, shows that the combined action of multiple morphogens and a corresponding interpretative threshold is indeed able to read positional information from measured gradients alone. In particular, it succeeds by applying the threshold to the overall balance of activators and repressors rather than to each factor individually."

Since repressors are often crucial in defining the borders of the stripes, it is natural to suppose that the activators are merely permissive, and that precision in positional information is provided by the repressors. Here we show that an alternative view is compatible with the data. In particular, activators and repressors contribute symmetrically to positional information: they work to increase or decrease the probability of transcription, but neither class acts separately according to a threshold that is independent of the concentrations of other factors. Thus, if more activators are present in a nucleus, a higher concentration of repressors will be required to reduce transcription to the same level. This means that positional information cannot be defined by any one factor in isolation, and nor can mutant results be interpreted reliably in the absence of data on other factors."

This has been proposed in the context of transcriptional activators in general (<a href=\"#bib76\">Struhl, 2001</a>) and observed between Hb and Bcd in controlling expression of <i>eve 2</i> (<a href=\"#bib74\">Stanojevic et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Simpson-Brose et al., 1994</a>). Our model shows that this effect is observed with a linear combination of concentrations: that is, without any pairwise interactions between Hb and Bcd or other factors. Thus, our model is compatible with the early findings of <a href=\"#bib4\">Arnosti et al. (1996)</a>, which suggest that <i>eve</i> transcription is controlled by the total balance of activators and repressors rather than through complex and intricate combinatorial interactions between TFs. However, this is not to say that cooperative interactions do not take place, or are not important in other contexts, but rather that it is necessary to distinguish between synergistic interactions that can be explained by independent binding of multiple factors (as in our model), and those that occur as a result of pairwise interactions between TFs. We expect pairwise interactions between TFs on the DNA to require particular arrangements of binding sites. Therefore, the success of our model without pairwise interactions suggests that the ordering and exact spacing of binding sites are not important, except potentially in the case of dual regulation. This agrees well with multiple observations about the flexibility of enhancer sequences, which can tolerate rearrangement over evolutionary time while maintaining their function (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib9\">Borok et al., 2010</a>)."

Our model does not reveal how Hb and Bcd achieve dual-regulatory activity, and it is quite possible that they make use of different mechanisms. One possibility is a change in protein\u2013protein interactions, through formation of homo-oligomers or interactions with co-factors (e.g., <a href=\"#bib31\">Janody et al., 2001</a>). Alternatively as with Sp1, changes in DNA occupancies may alter how regulators interact with adjacent TF molecules. We discuss experimental tests of these possibilities below. Regardless of mechanism, however, we propose that concentration-dependent effects are important, in contrast to the hypothesis that concentrations above a predefined threshold are neutral in effect.

These studies involve either perturbing a candidate regulator by mutation, over-expression or misexpression, or mutagenizing binding sites for a candidate regulator in an enhancer sequence, and then measuring the expression of <i>eve</i>. To confirm our predictions, we made qualitative comparisons between published data (in the form of a single representative image) and our model predictions.

To test which parts of the TFs are involved in mediating protein-protein interactions, the TFs themselves can be mutated, and protein\u2013protein interactions can be assayed by in vitro binding studies. Finally, to test the concentration-dependent effects directly, the concentration of Hb and Bcd can be manipulated in vivo by over-expression, knock-down and misexpression. Our modeling framework is especially useful in this last case, as predictions with and without concentration-dependent effects can be compared. We propose that misexpression studies are likely to be particularly informative, based on the fine-scale differences such as stripe bending and bulging that we were able to predict."

This is possible if we create additional Virtual Embryo data where perturbations, both to input TFs and enhancer sequences, are measured. For knock-down, over-expression or misexpression of TFs, we will need to create a new Virtual Embryo for each perturbation. This will capture all of the direct and indirect consequences of perturbing the TF. We can assess the consequences of mutating enhancer sequences by integrating transgenic reporters into any given Virtual Embryo dataset, as in <a href=\"#bib84\">Wunderlich et al., 2012</a>. Creating these new datasets is not a trivial undertaking technically but it would provide the framework for us to directly compare the output of our model predictions to experimental data at cellular resolution to detect fine-scale differences, and without making assumptions about indirect effects. For example, this would allow us to test our proposed role for <i>tll</i> in repressing the posterior border of <i>eve</i> stripe 7, where classic experiments have been inconclusive and to validate future predictions for other enhancers in the segmentation network. We fully anticipate that analyzing this type of data will lead to further refinements of our models."

To predict spatiotemporal expression patterns, it\u2019s important that the measurements are quantitative and at the resolution of individual cells. One advantage of the blastoderm is that the relevant nuclei are near the surface of the embryo, making it easier to segment the overall fluorescence signal and assign it to individual nuclei. However, microscopy and other techniques such as single-cell transcriptomics are continually improving (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kalisky et al., 2011</a>); we anticipate that many comparable datasets will become available over time, both for other developmental time points in <i>Drosophila</i>, and in other model systems.

Briefly, two reviewers suggest that the conclusions of the study should not be based on how well our model fits the training data (and hence recommend cross-validation or a blind test). Their concern is that this is circular, but whether it is or not depends on the conclusions being drawn. In this matter, it is perhaps best to understand our work as a regression model that describes the relationship observed between variables in a dataset\u2014the Virtual Embryo\u2014rather than as a machine-learning classifier whose expected performance on other data needs to be assessed in an unbiased way. For this reason, the first part of our work draws conclusions based on the fit to the data."

Our most important conclusion is that <i>eve</i> expression in these nuclei can be correctly separated into two classes using the measured concentrations of various transcription factors alone. This is biologically interesting and relevant\u2014for instance, in its implications for positional information in the early embryo. Perhaps what is confusing is that in justifying these conclusions we make use of predictions across the whole embryo, rather than just on the training data. However, the intention here is not to test the generality of the model or its validity as a classifier of independent data, but rather to assess the applicability of the model across the whole embryo; that is, whether the information content in the other stripes is consistent with the current model (or, biologically-speaking, whether a different source of information would be necessary to control activation of the enhancer in these regions e.g. additional signaling, epigenetic state, etc).

Further, although our model up to this point in the manuscript demonstrates that transcription factor concentrations alone provide sufficient positional information, we were interested in whether the ability of our model to fit the data might be constrained in biologically relevant ways. It was for this reason that we also tested whether our model, with the known regulators, could fit any stripe. We presented these findings under the heading of \u201cover-fitting\u201d, but in light of the reviewers\u2019 comments we clarified this in the section renamed \u201cThe model performs consistently across different subsets of the data\u201d."

The stopping point (i.e., the penalty for adding an extra parameter) is effectively arbitrary in this case, or at least difficult to determine <i>a priori</i> in a justifiable manner. Since we are interested in a minimal model that can explain the observed expression and found that four regulators is sufficient, we could put an upper bound on the number of regulators to consider in our models, at least as a starting point."

For <i>eve 3+7</i>, the best scoring linear model with three regulators (Gt, kni and tll) does not include Hb, an important regulator. It is also worth noting that these three regulators are the same as those picked up in our regulatory discovery method (<a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>)."

Instead, we are interested to see which regulators work together to control the spatial pattern observed, such as when two repressors define the borders of a stripe. In this case, it is valuable to consider how a transcription factor performs in the context of other transcription factors. This is not taken into account in stepwise selection. Instead, our approach rigorously compares the contribution of each pair of transcription factors in the context of the most informative two-regulator model from the remaining regulators. This, as we show, clearly highlights informative regulators, which are indeed able to predict expression in the early embryo. Nevertheless, we do not claim to have found all informative regulators, but rather propose a minimal model that works under the conditions analysed."

The purpose in modifying the inputs to these models is to compare their predictions with the results of experimental perturbations. In these experiments the intention is to modify one of the molecular inputs to the enhancer while leaving the others unchanged. For this reason, to compare like with like, it is important that we do not change the other parameters of the models, and hence we do not to re-optimise them."
