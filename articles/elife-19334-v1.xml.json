Here, we simultaneously measured sleep and food intake of individual flies and found a transient rise in sleep following meals. Depending on the amount consumed, the effect ranged from slightly arousing to strongly sleep inducing. Postprandial sleep was positively correlated with ingested volume, protein, and salt\u2014but not sucrose\u2014revealing meal property-specific regulation. Silencing of leucokinin receptor (Lkr) neurons specifically reduced sleep induced by protein consumption. Thermogenetic stimulation of leucokinin (Lk) neurons decreased whereas Lk downregulation by RNAi increased postprandial sleep, suggestive of an inhibitory connection in the Lk-Lkr circuit. We further identified a subset of non-leucokininergic cells proximal to Lkr neurons that rhythmically increased postprandial sleep when silenced, suggesting that these cells are cyclically gated inhibitory inputs to Lkr neurons. Together, these findings reveal the dynamic nature of postprandial sleep."

Here, we simultaneously measured sleep and food intake of individual flies and found a transient rise in sleep following meals. Depending on the amount consumed, the effect ranged from slightly arousing to strongly sleep inducing. Postprandial sleep was positively correlated with ingested volume, protein, and salt\u2014but not sucrose\u2014revealing meal property-specific regulation. Silencing of leucokinin receptor (Lkr) neurons specifically reduced sleep induced by protein consumption. Thermogenetic stimulation of leucokinin (Lk) neurons decreased whereas Lk downregulation by RNAi increased postprandial sleep, suggestive of an inhibitory connection in the Lk-Lkr circuit. We further identified a subset of non-leucokininergic cells proximal to Lkr neurons that rhythmically increased postprandial sleep when silenced, suggesting that these cells are cyclically gated inhibitory inputs to Lkr neurons. Together, these findings reveal the dynamic nature of postprandial sleep."

Some of these respond specifically to the consumption of protein. Others are sensitive to the fruit fly\u2019s internal clock, reducing post-meal sleepiness only around dusk. Thus, post-meal sleepiness can be regulated in a number of different ways."

Results on human postprandial behavior have shown an\u00a0increased sleep propensity following a meal, a lagging response, or no effect at all (<a href=\"#bib34\">Orr et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zammit et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wells et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Harnish et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Stahl et al., 1983</a>). It has been proposed that postprandial sleep is not invariable; it may be absent in particular individuals or heavily dependent on specific food properties (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stahl et al., 1983</a>). While the behavior likely exists, these intrinsic variabilities have limited our ability to study its molecular basis. A thorough examination of this behavior would be facilitated by use of an animal model although, at present, no clear model exists (<a href=\"#bib47\">Watson, 2014</a>)."

Using this standard, we extracted sleep parameters by defining sleep as periods of inactivity\u00a0&gt;5 min. Despite different housing and food consistency, we found sleep architecture to be similar to previous studies using high resolution object tracking, a method which has greater resolution of total sleep and sleep duration than the infrared-beam based alternative (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Donelson et al., 2012</a>). Flies appeared to move less after meals than before<b>\u2014</b>an effect more pronounced with larger meals<b>\u2014</b>suggesting that sleep might also be greater after eating (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

Subsequent to the meal, P<sub>sleep</sub> rose rapidly and exceeded the respective pre-meal P<sub>sleep</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To quantify changes in sleep subsequent to each meal, we calculated the change in P<sub>sleep</sub> of respective time points before and after each event (i.e. t<sup>+1</sup> \u2013 t<sup>\u22121</sup>, t<sup>+2</sup> \u2013 t<sup>\u22122</sup>, \u2026).

To test if arousal threshold is increased after a meal, we adapted methodology from the <i>Drosophila</i> arousal tracking system in which animals are exposed to a series of increasing vibrational stimuli (0.8\u20133.2 <i>g</i>) once every hour in order to measure the intensity at which inactive animals respond (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">van Alphen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Faville et al., 2015</a>). Consistent with previous studies, we found that arousal threshold initially increases with the amount of time that a fly is inactive, with the greatest change occurring in the first 5 min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shaw et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Huber et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">van Alphen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Faville et al., 2015</a>). Since the maximum duration of inactivity is lower following a meal, irrespective of sleep probability (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), we filtered arousal events to compare animals in similar stages of sleep. While animals inactive for more than 5 min are experiencing change in sleep depth, animals inactive for 0\u20135 min are transitioning into sleep. In this transition state animals showed a significantly greater arousal threshold in the 20, 40, and 60 min post-meal compared to animals during the respective pre-meal times (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Interestingly, the correlation between arousal threshold and postprandial sleep grew weaker when comparing animals in deeper stages of sleep (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>). This suggests that food intake transiently influences sleep induction rather than depth, which might be shaped solely by the amount of time that an animal is inactive."

Re-analysis of sleep surrounding a meal, where sleep was defined as periods of immobility and a lack of grooming exceeding 5 min, lowered total sleep but did not alter the rise in postprandial sleep (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>)."

Since average postprandial sleep lasted between 20\u201340 min, and since arousal threshold differences were most apparent in the first 20 min, we re-calculated \u0394P<sub>sleep</sub> for the 20 min surrounding each meal. We found a significant correlation between \u0394P<sub>sleep</sub> and consumption volume when meals were analyzed individually (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) or binned (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Since this analysis used individual meals rather than individual animals, we tested whether animals that consumed meals more frequently could bias the observed effect. We performed a Monte Carlo simulation by iteratively recapitulating the analysis with an equal number of randomly selected meals from each animal and found that equal sampling accurately portrays the full data set (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>). Since sleep is derived from periods of inactivity, we considered whether increased consumption could affect mobility, which might in turn appear to be sleep. The change in movement rate after a meal (\u0394<sub>speed</sub>) showed a much weaker correlation to meal size than \u0394P<sub>sleep</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Since speed is a strong indicator of mobility, we reasoned that immobility is not likely responsible for the sleep effect."

All diets contained a base of 0.25% protein to induce feeding while minimizing effects on baseline sleep that might arise by differences in sucrose consumption. Within each series we compared nutrient consumption within a narrow volume range (0.02\u20130.04 \u00b5l, representing 33\u201338% of recorded meals) to limit the contribution of ingested volume on sleep. We found that \u0394P<sub>sleep</sub> was significantly correlated to both protein and salt ingestion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>).

To test the role of Lkr neurons in the postprandial sleep response mediated by nutrients, we supplemented a sucrose diet with either salt or tryptone. <i>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></i>-silenced animals and their controls showed statistically indistinguishable \u0394P<sub>sleep</sub> responses to salt manipulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In contrast, while protein ingestion increased postprandial sleep in controls, <i>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></i>-silenced animals showed a strong waking response, or a negative shift in postprandial sleep (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Interestingly, this waking response exceeded that of control animals on sucrose alone, indicating that protein can also drive wakefulness in the absence of <i>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></i> neuronal activity. We did not observe changes in meal size, total sleep, or total consumption, indicating that these behaviors are independent of Lkr influence on postprandial sleep (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). To test whether this phenotype was caused by changes in development, we conditionally silenced the cells by co-expressing a temperature sensitive GAL4 suppressant protein, GAL80<sup>ts</sup>,\u00a0throughout development (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Inactivation of GAL80<sup>ts</sup> to silence <i>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></i>-labeled cells in adulthood was sufficient to induce a postprandial sleep defect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>)."

Although we demonstrate the effectiveness of these dietary components in isolation, we note that meals typically incorporate multiple elements. Thus, further work is necessary to identify the mechanisms by which each constituent is sensed and the potential interactions between them.

This suggests that ingested protein promotes both sleep and wakefulness, and that the wakefulness is normally counterbalanced by Lkr neuronal activity. While this study does not specifically identify the waking output for protein, it was previously shown that Translin acts through Lk-expressing cells to drive wakefulness in response to sucrose starvation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Murakami et al., 2016</a>).

Strips of infrared led lights were placed\u00a0~16 cm behind each chamber on a heat sink to provide backlighting for feeding and motion tracking. Each animal was given access to a capillary filled with liquid food. Above the chambers was a 2 mm gap with a small overhang allowed for a sliding gate (5 mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 mm) to seal individual fly cells. The gate contained evenly spaced 2.5 mm vertically oriented holes above the center of each fly cell. This allowed for the insertion of tightly fitting 200 \u00b5l pipette tip sleeves that were cut to hold the food-containing capillaries (5 \u00b5l glass capillaries, VWR). Sleeves were made by cutting the narrow end of 200 \u00b5l pipette tips to fit capillaries tightly. The dye used for liquid meniscus tracking was composed of 75% mineral oil, 25% dodecane, and 1% Copper (II) 1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-octabutoxy-29<i>H</i>,31<i>H</i>-phthalocyanine (Sigma-Aldrich,\u00a0St.\u00a0Louis,\u00a0MO).

The camera was mounted with a custom bracket at equal height to the base of the capillaries. PhenoCapture software was used to capture one image per min using the time-lapse image capture tool (<a href=\"http://www.phenocapture.net\">www.phenocapture.net</a>). Each capillary had an exterior reference mark and was pre-loaded with an oil-based dye band, marking the meniscus of the liquid food. ImageJ was used for image processing\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib37\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>). Images were cropped to include all capillaries and dye bands. The\u00a0images were background subtracted using the built-in subtract background function with a rolling ball radius of five and disabled smoothing. The\u00a0images were then thresholded manually until the dye bands and reference marks were faithfully displayed without background noise. The\u00a0images were split to contain image stacks of individual capillaries and tracked using a custom ImageJ plugin. The relative distance between the food meniscus and the reference mark was calculated at each frame using the custom plugin. We used a meal selection algorithm that estimates noise by an iterative filtration of distal values 4.0 s.d. above the \u0394<sub>pixel</sub> mean (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Meals were then selected as values which were 3.5 s.d. above the estimated noise, based on the one frame/min sampling rate. In a setup tracking 30 capillaries, this method provides 10 nL resolution although greater resolution can be achieved by increasing camera resolution and sampling rate. Though infrequent, temporally adjacent feeding bouts were combined and time stamped with the latter meal time. Thus, feeding bouts followed by at least 1 min of non-feeding were considered meals. Each feeding event was corrected for effects of evaporation and luminance fluctuation on observed meal size by subtracting the average noise value from all non-feeding frames. Meal output contains meal associated time and corrected volume."

                                "text": "Behavioral tracking was carried out with a custom, freeware, cross-platform analysis framework (JavaGrinders Library, available for free download at <a href=\"http://iEthology.com/\">http://iEthology.com/</a>). This library utilizes and extends machine vision functions provided by the OpenCV project for high-resolution analysis of spatial and behavioral data. With an integrated interface for standard USB video device class (UVC) cameras, the software implements multi-stage object detection and analysis for 8-bit grayscale/32-bit color frame sequences in real-time. Following the subtraction of a reference frame, the tracker locates the frame coordinate with the highest remaining pixel value. Provided this value exceeds the object's threshold, the detection algorithm proceeds outwards until it identifies a starting point along the object's thresholded border. By following this edge until it returns to the starting point, the detection algorithm characterizes the object's outline as a polygonal shape. The object's center location is estimated by the polygon's centroid, directional attributes (e.g., long axis) which are obtained via a Singular Value Decomposition of the polygon's outline. The projected size is represented by the shape's area. The size of a fly tracked in the ARC measured approximately 15\u201320 pixels in length. The present study used a Microsoft Lifecam Studio camera with the infrared filter replaced by an infrared pass filter. Although much higher rates are possible within this system, a reduced sampling rate of 1 Hz was chosen as it proved sufficient for identifying the extended periods of inactivity indicative of sleep. The\u00a0maximum frame rate capability depends on a number of factors, including the video's resolution, the object's size, the performances of processor and graphics card, and the specifications of the hardware drivers used to interface with the camera. Distance traveled was obtained from Euclidean measures between object centers in consecutive frames. Motion values less than 50% of the fly body length (FBL) were discarded. Dropped positions were reset to the last known location for motion and sleep calculation purposes. This system has been previously tested for <i>Drosophila</i> tracking sufficiency and demonstrated enhanced motion/sleep characterization compared to alternative methods (<a href=\"#bib8\">Donelson et al., 2012</a>). An animal was considered sleeping during any period of immobility exceeding 5 min, based on previous studies showing that this period of inactivity is highly correlated with hallmarks of sleep (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shaw et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Huber et al., 2004</a>). Speed of each motion event was calculated as the distance traveled during that event divided by its uninterrupted duration. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that sleep has been measured in vertically oriented chambers, and on a liquid diet. However, we found sleep patterning in the ARC to be in line with the more commonly used Drosophila Activity Monitor (TriKinetics, Waltham, MA). Notably, object detection provides a higher resolution for sleep bout duration\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

All reported values are mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine data normality. Data were analyzed using either Wilcoxon matched-pairs sign rank test for comparisons of non-parametric P<sub>sleep</sub> of animals before and after meals, Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons for non-parametric comparisons of \u0394P<sub>sleep</sub>, or the Mann-Whitney test when comparing two non-parametric groups, non-paired observations. Comparisons of meal size to given features were analyzed using Spearman rank correlation, due to non-parametric distribution, while binned data were analyzed using Pearson correlation."

The authors show decreased locomotion post-feeding, increased startle response, and that volume consumed and nutrient affects sleep probability. They further show that silencing a subset of LKR neurons decreased sleep whereas silencing LK neurons increased sleep, and interpreted this to suggest that LK has multiple roles in promoting and inhibiting sleep. Overall, there are intriguing findings in this manuscript; in particular the notion the feeding increases sleep is very exciting. The data, however, seem preliminary and more suitable for publication in a specialty journal. My main reservations are the following:"

However, we agree that experts in the field should be given a relatable scale for comparison with their own data, and so a seconds per minute scale was added to the first sleep probability graphs shown (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) as well as the graph of sleep probability related meal size (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We also recognize the utility in further examining the sleep architecture surrounding a meal. However, since sleep duration in the time leading up to a meal is restricted by the fact that the animal cannot sleep while eating, we had originally excluded any examinations of sleep architecture. Since sleep initiation is not restricted we have included a supplemental figure showing the probability of sleep initiation as well as the sleep frequency before and after meals (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Our data shows a clear opposing phenotype when silencing Lkr versus Lk neurons, shedding new light on their findings.
