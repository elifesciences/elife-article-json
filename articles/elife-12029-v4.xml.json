TANs are found in a basal ganglia structure called the striatum and have a characteristic firing pattern during important outcomes, consisting of a burst of activity followed by a pause lasting several hundred milliseconds. The model suggests that when the outcome of a behavior is uncertain, the length of this pause is increased. This boosts the activity of another group of neurons in the striatum, known as spiny neurons, and this in turn increases the rate of learning."

The next step is to test some of the new predictions about uncertainty experimentally."

A principled way to resolve this uncertainty is to use previous experience to guide behavior towards actions that have led to positive outcomes in the past and away from actions that have led to negative outcomes. Convergent evidence suggests that the basal ganglia can guide behavior by incorporating positive and negative feedback in a reinforcement learning process (<a href=\"#bib62\">O'Doherty et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Barnes et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Frank, 2005</a>). However, learning can be complicated in a changing environment, as the validity of past experiences and the relationship between actions and outcomes become uncertain as well. Mathematical models suggest that it is optimal to take uncertainty into account in learning and decision making (<a href=\"#bib89\">Yu and Dayan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mathys et al., 2011</a>), but it is unclear whether the basal ganglia can directly consider uncertainty in feedback-based learning."

An RPE is the signed difference between the observed and expected outcomes and is often used in RL to generate point-estimates of action-values (<a href=\"#bib79\">Sutton and Barto, 1998</a>). Phasic dopamine\u00a0(DA) is thought to provide an RPE signal to striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and induce learning through changes in corticostriatal plasticity (<a href=\"#bib59\">Montague et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Reynolds and Wickens, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Calabresi et al., 2007</a>), with opponent learning signals in the direct and indirect pathways (<a href=\"#bib34\">Frank, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Collins and Frank, 2014</a>). Within these pathways, separate populations code for the (positive and negative) values of distinct action plans (<a href=\"#bib74\">Samejima et al., 2005</a>). Multiple lines of evidence in humans and animals support this model, including optogenetic manipulations (<a href=\"#bib82\">Tsai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Kravitz et al., 2012</a>), synaptic plasticity studies (<a href=\"#bib75\">Shen et al., 2008</a>), functional imaging (<a href=\"#bib57\">McClure et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">O'Doherty et al., 2003</a>), genetics and pharmacology in combination with imaging (<a href=\"#bib66\">Pessiglione et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Frank et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Jocham et al., 2011</a>) and evidence from medication manipulations in Parkinson\u2019s patients (<a href=\"#bib33\">Frank et al., 2004</a>)."

RL models typically adopt a fixed learning rate, such that every RPE of similar magnitude equally drives learning. However, a more adaptive strategy in a changing environment is to adjust learning rates as a function of uncertainty, so that unexpected outcomes have greater influence when one is more uncertain of which action to take (e.g., initially before contingencies are well known, or following a change-point), but less influence once the contingencies appear stable and the task is well\u00a0known (<a href=\"#bib89\">Yu and Dayan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Nassar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mathys et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Payzan-LeNestour et al., 2011</a>).

With few exceptions (<a href=\"#bib80\">Tan and Bullock, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Ashby and Crossley, 2011</a>), models of the basal ganglia typically do not incorporate striatal acetylcholine. Within the striatum, cholinergic interneurons are the predominant source of acetylcholine (<a href=\"#bib87\">Woolf and Butcher, 1981</a>). These interneurons, also known as tonically active neurons (TANs) due to their intrinsic 2\u201310-Hz firing pattern, are giant, spanning large areas of the striatum with dense axonal arborization and broad synaptic input (<a href=\"#bib38\">Goldberg and Reynolds, 2011</a>). TANs appear to be necessary to learning only when flexibility is required (<a href=\"#bib68\">Ragozzino et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bradfield et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that they might modulate the learning rate as a function of changes in outcome statistics (i.e., uncertainty). Similar to dopaminergic neurons, TANs show sensitivity to rewarding events and develop a learned phasic response to predictive cues (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aosaki et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Morris et al., 2004</a>).

Given that MSN sub-populations code for distinct action values (<a href=\"#bib74\">Samejima et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Frank, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Lau and Glimcher, 2008</a>), co-activation of multiple populations can signal enhanced uncertainty over action selection, which would translate into greater inhibition onto TANs. The synchrony in the TAN response suggests a global signal (<a href=\"#bib41\">Graybiel et al., 1994</a>), which can then be modulated by inhibitory MSN collaterals across a large range of spiny inputs. The TAN pause response is consistent with a signal of uncertainty that adjusts learning. First, it increases with the unpredictability of a stochastic outcome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Apicella et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2011</a>). Second, pharmacological blockade or lesioning excitatory input to TANs impairs learning, specifically after a change in outcome contingencies (<a href=\"#bib67\">Ragozzino et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bradfield et al., 2013</a>).

In the model, cholinergic signals dynamically modulate the efficacy of reinforcement feedback, driving changes in the number of neurons available for synaptic plasticity during reinforcement, hence the effective learning rate of the network as a whole. Thus, TANs allow the basal ganglia to tailor its learning rate to its environment, balancing the tradeoff between learning flexibility and robustness to noise by adjusting learning as a function of policy uncertainty embedded in the MSN population code. We show that this behavior is consistent with a normative account using an approximately Bayesian model and that its main functionality can be simplified in algorithmic form using a modified RL model, thus spanning Marr\u2019s levels of implementation, algorithm, and computation. The model is consistent with several existing lines of evidence and makes falsifiable predictions."

Each of (here, two) motor responses is coded by distinct columns of Go and NoGo units, representing positive and negative evidence for alternative that responses, learned via reinforcement conveyed by DA signals in the SNc. The basal ganglia contribute to action selection by disinhibiting thalamocortical activity for representing thatthe response having the largest Go\u2013NoGo activation differential. Go units inhibit globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) units, which otherwise tonically inhibit the thalamus. NoGo units have the opposite effect by inhibiting the external segment (GPe), which in turn inhibits GPi. TANs are represented as a separate layer of endogenously active units that modulate MSN excitability during the dynamic burst\u2013pause pattern windowing the dopaminergic reward prediction error signals. This pause duration can be fixed, or sensitive to the population uncertainty of MSNs (see below). Dotted black lines correspond to proposed feedback mechanism from MSNs to TANs.

Varying pause duration across networks reveals a behavioral trade-off between learning speed following probabilistic reversal and asymptotic accuracy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, top row). During acquisition, learning speed is similar across a range of TAN pause durations, but networks with long pauses exhibit higher levels of asymptotic accuracy. Long pauses facilitate a disproportionate increase in synaptic efficacy for the most frequently rewarded response despite the occasional spurious outcome (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, bottom right), driving MSNs to focus their activity to a single dominant action (as quantified by MSN entropy; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>,\u00a0bottom). However, this same property makes such networks slow to reverse. Conversely, networks with short TAN pause durations learn more quickly following reversal but at a cost of asymptotic accuracy. Mechanistically, this occurs as short TAN pauses elicit weaker activation of spiny units, and hence elicit less activity-dependent plasticity, leading to a smaller learned divergence in synaptic weights between alternative responses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, bottom right). This stunted divergence allows for continued co-activation of multiple response alternatives during subsequent action selection, and hence more stochastic choice, but this same property supports the network\u2019s ability to quickly reinforce alternative actions following change points. Thus, although in these simulations the TAN pause modulates excitability only during window of the phasic dopaminergic reinforcement signal, it influences which MSNs learn and hence the population activity and action selection entropy thereof during subsequent choices."

In a probabilistic reversal learning task in which the optimal action was rewarded with an 85% reward rate (suboptimal action rewarded 15%), networks with a short TAN pause outperformed networks with a longer TAN pause (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, left). Accuracy (percent choice of the optimal action) across all trials was 78% (SD<i>=</i>7%) for the shortest pause compared with 70% (SD=5%) for the longest TAN pause [t(148) = 7.3, p&lt;3x10<sup>\u201310</sup>, Cohen\u2019s d = 1.2].

In both environments, overall accuracy varies parametrically with pause duration and degrades gracefully. These simulations show that, for each environment, the optimal pause duration is dependent on the cost of sensitivity to noise and the need for flexible behavior. The high MSN entropy generated by a short TAN pause allows for increased flexibility, which is advantageous in a highly deterministic environment with a single reversal, where spurious negative outcomes are less common, lowering the cost of sensitivity to noise. In contrast, the lower entropy MSN representation generated by longer TAN pauses (due to divergent weights) is advantageous when the task is highly stochastic. The ability to ignore spurious negative outcomes allows the network to maintain a stable estimate of an action value, which can be more important than behavioral flexibility. As a result, the performance of a network with fixed pause duration is dependent on the environmental statistics."

For an ideal observer, the proper measure of this uncertainty depends on the parameterization of the generative processes of the task, which may require several levels of hierarchical representations (<a href=\"#bib11\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mathys et al., 2011</a>) that may be unavailable in a local striatal network.

Although we have thus far described this entropy as an observable variable to provide an explanation for how TAN pauses affect the trade-off between flexibility and stability because it can be read out from the distribution of MSN firing rates, we hypothesized that this same measure may be used to reciprocally influence TAN pauses and hence learning. In this way, the system could self-detect its own uncertainty in a way that (unlike any given fixed pause duration) is not dependent on the parameterization of a particular task and is implicitly available in the population response."

Because reversal tasks are, by definition, non-stationary, the Beta distribution does not represent the exact posterior distribution of expected values and is slow to adjust to a reversal: it becomes too certain about reward contingencies. A Bayesian treatment allowing for the possibility that the outcome statistics can change can be approximated using a mixture distribution combining the posterior of expected values with a uniform distribution (<a href=\"#bib61\">Nassar et al., 2010</a>). In this approximation, the mixture component is the probability a change has occurred to some other unknown contingencies. Instead, we use a multiplicative parameter <math id=\"inf5\"><mi>\u03b3</mi></math> to decay the counts of the Beta hyper-parameters towards the prior after each trial, an approximation that has been used previously to model rodent and human behavior (<a href=\"#bib25\">Daw et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Doll et al., 2009</a>). Decaying the counts multiplicatively maintains the mode expected value for each action but increases the variance (uncertainty) of the distribution. This effectively reduces the model\u2019s confidence of the expected value without changing its best estimate.

However, the biophysical details by which spiny neuron modulate TAN activity are not fully understood. Direct transmission of entropy may not be trivial as population entropy is a nonlinear function of the units\u2019 activity. Here we consider a more explicit mechanism by which TANs directly approximate MSN entropy through synaptic integration. First, consider the minimalist case of just two MSNs coding for alternative actions. Here, the entropy is high when both are active or inactive, but low when either of the two units alone is active. In terms of a Boolean function, the entropy of the two MSNs is the logical opposite of an 'exclusive OR', a non-linear problem that typically requires interneurons to detect (<a href=\"#bib73\">Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986</a>). While one potential mechanism for TANs to detect MSN entropy is by including interneurons, this non-linear detection is linearly solvable if the problem is split into two separate detections: the detection of when both neurons are active and the detection of when neither is active (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, top left). Consequently, a potential approximation for MSN entropy would be the detection of coincident activity (or inactivity) of pairs of MSNs. While an active readout of joint inactivity is implausible, this problem is solved by the opponent nature of MSN pathways in the BG (<a href=\"#bib34\">Frank, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Kravitz et al., 2012</a>), where the TANs could detect either coincident activity of two D1 MSNs signaling Go activity or two D2 MSNs signaling NoGo activity."

If synaptic signaling from both MSNs is needed to propagate an action potential to the cell body, then the pair of synapses can be thought of as a coincidence detector. In logical terms, the synapse pairs perform Boolean 'AND' detection (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, top left). Several pair of D1 synapses located on the dendrites of a single TAN could result in the summation of these signals in the cell body of the TAN, approximating half of the entropy function signaling that there is evidence for multiple motor responses. Similarly, multiple pairs of D2 synapses contributes to the other half of the entropy function, signaling that there is evidence against multiple responses. Thus, these two measures could effectively approximate decision uncertainty in the MSN population and are detectable by a single TAN via direct synapses from MSNs. In principle, other mechanisms within the striatum could transmit the population uncertainty (e.g., via further interactions between MSNs and fast-spiking interneurons). Our exercise below thus presents but a single plausible mechanism."

The functional significance of this burst is an open question but one likely function of the post-pause burst is to facilitate synaptic plasticity through the release of dopamine during an important time window. Optogentic stimulation of TAN neurons leads to the release of dopamine through the activity of the nicotinic receptors on striatal dopamine terminals (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cachope et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Threlfell et al., 2012</a>). Dopamine release precipitated by post-pause TAN activity would result in the delivery of dopamine immediately following a period in which striatal spiny neurons were disinhibited. This timing has important plasticity consequences as dopamine release following glutamatergic input promotes spine enlargement (<a href=\"#bib88\">Yagishita et al., 2014</a>). Consequently, we hypothesize the post-pause TAN burst promotes plasticity by releasing dopamine during a sensitive time window following increased spiny neuron activity, while concurrently suppressing potentially interfering activity with muscarinic inhibition. To investigate the consequences of this hypothesis, we modeled the effects of a phasic increase in TAN activity following the feedback pause in the reversal learning task in an 85% reward environment. We found higher post-pause TAN firing rates resulted in higher asymptotic accuracy following reversal as compared to lower firing rates <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>. Interestingly, this effect was selective to reversal: there was no additional effect of of post-pause TAN activity on learning speed, both prior to and following reversal, and no effects on asymptotic performance prior to reversal. Together, the effects of TAN pause and rebound burst act to enhance the BG network\u2019s ability to reverse and stabilize newly learned contingencies."

This problem is general to learning with several proposed solutions (<a href=\"#bib89\">Yu and Dayan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mathys et al., 2011</a>). Here, we proposed how the striatum may incorporate uncertainty to an adaptive process in line with these general principals of learning with a model in which striatal cholinergic signaling promotes encoding uncertainty in the MSN population. Across all simulations, incorporating TANs increased asymptotic performance over the previously published BG model (<a href=\"#bib34\">Frank, 2005</a>). Simulated lesions of M1-AChRs revealed a qualitatively similar pattern of behavior as reported in rodent ablation and optogenetic studies (<a href=\"#bib58\">McCool et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Witten et al., 2010</a>). Parametric manipulations of TAN pauses revealed a trade-off between asymptotic accuracy and flexible learning driven by changes in MSN entropy. As a result, a network with any fixed TAN behavior can perform well in one task but may perform poorly in others. MSN entropy decreased over time in networks with long, fixed duration TAN pauses, making them less sensitive to stochastic noise, and facilitating performance in highly stochastic, sparsely rewarded environments. In contrast, networks with short, fixed duration TAN pauses had relatively constant levels of MSN entropy, resulting in labile representations sensitive to noise. As these networks are sensitive to negative feedback, they were able to learn quickly following a reversal, particularly in more deterministic environments."

These goals are counter-posed, thus any fixed learning rule that treats each observation equally at the time of observation will not be able to achieve both. If a learner is sensitive to recent events, she will be quick to detect changes but sensitive to any noise in the observations. Conversely, if a learner considers a longer time window to determine the best course of action, she will be slower to detect a change but be able to ignore irrelevant outcomes. Computationally, this pattern can be described by decay rate in the approximately Bayesian model as a fast decay rate considers recent events more strongly than a slow decay rate, which considers a longer history of events."

Short TAN pauses are computationally similar to a high learning rate (fast decay in the Bayesian model) and long TAN pauses are similar to a low learning rate (slow decay). These effects are driven by relative differences in disinhibition of MSNs during reinforcement, and are not dependent on temporal dynamics of the pause (the same tradeoff between flexible and stable learning was seen when the magnitude of the pause rather than duration was manipulated). During the TAN pause, the reduction in TAN activity lowers the level of MSN inhibition, increasing the differential of activity between response selection and feedback. The greater disinhibition associated with longer TAN pauses results in a higher differential of activity and stronger reinforcement, driving the MSN population towards a lower entropy representation. Conceptually, embedding uncertainty into the population code of spiny neurons is similar to proposals that probabilistic population codes are used to maintain distributions for Bayesian inference (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ma et al., 2006</a>). In both cases, the entropy of the population code can represent uncertainty, but here we explore the implication of this notion for learning within the basal ganglia, rather than inference in sensory cortex."

This happens because the reduction in entropy reflects a reduction in the number of units active during reinforcement, such that the highly active units representing the dominant (most rewarded) action will persist in the face of spurious outcomes. Highly active units require more reinforcement to unlearn the association while inactive units are not available for reinforcement due to activity-dependent plasticity. As a result, an MSN population with lower entropy learns more slowly. As previously pointed out with the basal ganglia acetylcholine-based entropy (BABE) model, a reduction in MSN entropy will also decrease stochastic exploration as a decrease in MSN entropy lowers noise in the evidence for action (<a href=\"#bib78\">Stocco, 2012</a>). In this work, we provide a single mechanism that affects learning rate and exploration as a function of entropy, but we note that even the exploration effect is learned and is collinear with the change in learning rate: we manipulated TAN pauses only during reinforcement, the window in which pauses overlap with phasic dopamine responses (<a href=\"#bib60\">Morris et al., 2004</a>). Both changes arise as changes in synaptic weights alter the entropic representations in future trials, allowing the network to anneal its learning rate and change its stochastic exploration adaptively with its own uncertainty."

This constitutes a core prediction of the model. We propose that coincident MSN activity is largely involved in regulating the TAN pause that occurs during novel and/or rewarding events (forming a window around phasic dopaminergic signaling) and may be less relevant at other periods of time. However, the\u00a0exact influence of MSNs signaling on TAN activity and the mechanism for its transduction remain open to\u00a0questions."

In this case, we might still expect TAN activity to reflect uncertainty signals relevant to learning, relayed from other brain areas. The source of an uncertainty signal might originate through an explicit system that could signal a change-point in the reward rate (<a href=\"#bib11\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Nassar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Wilson et al., 2010</a>) or infer a change in a latent context or rule-structure (<a href=\"#bib37\">Gershman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Donoso et al., 2014</a>). In principle, MSN entropy could also be influenced by hierarchical inputs from cortical areas that either further constrain action selection or increase noise, based on other factors such as perceived volatility. Human functional\u00a0MRI\u00a0(fMRI) studies have identified correlates of uncertainty processing in multiple areas, notably in the anterior cingulate cortex and striatum (<a href=\"#bib11\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bach et al., 2011</a>), leaving open multiple possible mechanism to consider uncertainty at the whole brain level, including the top-down modulation of MSN entropy or TAN signals. Interestingly, a recent fMRI study have linked abstract prediction errors to the basal-forebrain, a separate source of cholinergic signaling (<a href=\"#bib45\">Iglesias et al., 2013</a>). A final possibility is that uncertainty can be communicated to the TANs via more complex local striatal networks involving both MSNs and GABAergic interneurons, or an external source, such as a derivative of the dopamine learning signal. Nevertheless, while we have proposed that MSN synapses on TANs may directly relay an uncertainty cue, the core model prediction that TANs promote adaptive striatal learning via some representation of uncertainty is not itself sensitive to the source of the uncertainty cue."

A central prediction of the model is that MSN entropy should correlate with decision uncertainty during a task, which interacts with task stochasticity, and should covary with the degree of TAN pause inhibition. Similarly, we predict TAN pause duration (or equivalently, TAN firing rate) should correlate with decision uncertainty. Whereas previous studies have found a link between TAN activity and reversal learning (<a href=\"#bib67\">Ragozzino et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Witten et al., 2010</a>), our model makes the more specific prediction that M2 blockade would correspond with a decrease in overall accuracy during the performance of a probabilistic reversal learning task with multiple reward schedules. Notably, these manipulations were performed in the medial striatum, an area typically thought to be more involved in reversal than acquisition (<a href=\"#bib19\">Clarke et al., 2008</a>). It is an open question whether TAN ablations would affect acquisition performance in other striatal areas, and in fact our model does predict changes in acquisition depending on the probabilities of reinforcement. We also expect M2 blockade would affect the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation by interfering with the striatum\u2019s ability to anneal it\u2019s own exploration policy with uncertainty. We would expect this effect to extend to overtraining; M2 blockade may lessen the effects of overtraining on stochastic tasks. We would expect optogentic silencing of TANs entirely to have similar effects."

Rather, we propose how a specific system, the striatum, can modulate its own behavior adaptively in line with Bayesian accounts and provide an interpretation of the role of TANs, tying together electrophysiological, pharmacological, lesion and behavioral data. This poses an additional theoretical question, as there is evidence to suggest that people learn in an adaptive way when faced with change points (<a href=\"#bib11\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Nassar et al., 2010</a>), and in different contexts in a process that likely involves the frontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib20\">Collins and Koechlin, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Collins and Frank, 2013</a>): why would the striatum consider uncertainty in a heuristic fashion if other systems are able to consider uncertainty explicitly? One benefit such a heuristic system that approximates optimal behavior could offer would be a lack of complexity. Optimal adaptation in a changing environment requires knowledge of the generative process underlying change, a problem that is complex and potentially ill-posed. Inference over the generative model may be too costly in highly complex, rapidly change or novel environments. In such an environment, striatal uncertainty could still be available and alter behavior in an adaptive way, encouraging exploration and weighing recent feedback strongly."

As the conductances of each unit vary across time and between trial to trial as a function of input activity, the rate-coded activity of each unit with a layer varies with its inputs and noise. This added noise induces stochasticity in network choices (and their latencies; Ratcliff and Frank 2012) for any given set of synaptic weights, encouraging exploration: noise in motor cortex induces changes in the degree to which a candidate response is active and hence subject to disinhibition by gating via striatum, and noise in the SNc facilitates within-trial variation in the balance between Go and NoGo unit activity, differentially emphasizing learned positive versus negative outcomes and their effect on gating. Together, these sources of variance yield stochastic choice and dynamics within the striatum shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>."

As a first approximation, action selection in the neural network is mediated by two simulated populations of MSNs. The populations of 'Go' and 'NoGo' units, representing striatonigral ('D1') and striatopallidal ('D2') MSNs, respectively, receive excitatory input from a cortical layer corresponding to a unique stimulus. Both the Go and NoGo layer contain 18 units, half of which, through their downstream targets, are connected to one of two motor responses. Reciprocal connections with a layer of inhibitory interneurons (simulating the GABergic fast-spiking interneurons in the striatum) control the overall excitability of the two populations. Activity in Go units inhibits a population in the globus pallidus interal segment (GPi), which results in disinhibition of the thalamus. Activity in the NoGo units inhibits a population in the globus pallidus external segment (GPe), which results in disinhibition of the GPi and inhibition of the thalamus. If there is sufficient activity in the thalamus, it provides a bolus of activity to a corresponding motor cortical column, which can then inhibit its competitors via lateral inhibition, and an action will be selected. This process is stochastic at a network level and depends both on interactions between units that vary with time (learning) as well as noise in the network within trials. However, while this process has trial to trial variability, activity in the Go pathway will facilitate the selection of an action through its downstream effects on the thalamus while activity in the NoGo pathway will suppress response selection."

Dopamine is simulated to act through D1 receptors in Go units, increasing excitability. In addition, D1 receptors were simulated to enhance contrast by increasing the striatal unit\u2019s activation gain and activation threshold. This has the effect of increasing the activity of highly active Go units and decreasing the activity of weakly active units, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. D2 receptors were simulated in NoGo units such that an increase in dopamine decreases NoGo excitability. As a result, a phasic increase in dopamine during feedback has the effect of increasing Go activity relative to NoGo activity while a phasic decrease in dopamine will have the reverse effect. Altering the activity of Go and NoGo units in response to phasic changes in dopamine during feedback alters coritcostriatal weights through the contrastive Hebbian component of the learning rule. This facilitates error driven learning without providing the network a supervised learning signal."

Unlike striatal Go and NoGo units, the activity of TANs were not dependent on synaptic signaling from other units in the network and TANs were simulated with little stochasticity. During stimulus presentation and action selection, TAN activity was held constant across all trials in all simulations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, top left). Following action selection, a TAN burst\u2013pause was simulated during outcome feedback. The burst was simulated at the onset of feedback to mirror the TAN burst by transiently increasing <i>V<sub>m</sub></i> above the equilibrium potential. The subsequent pause was generated with an accommodation current, which allows the initial burst of TAN activity to create a subsequent hyperpolarization. This simulates the after-hyperpolarization that has been found to follow a depolarization in TANs via calcium-dependent potassium current (<a href=\"#bib84\">Wilson and Goldberg, 2006</a>)."

The effects of M1 and M2 receptors are relatively well understood (<a href=\"#bib38\">Goldberg and Reynolds, 2011</a>) and thus suitable for modeling. M1 and M2 receptors have opposing effects on MSN excitability: M1 activity increases dendritic excitability of indirect pathway MSNs through the post-synaptic closure of Kir2\u2009K+ channels (<a href=\"#bib77\">Shen et al., 2007</a>), while M2 receptors inhibit glutamate release in presynaptic terminals of both direct and indirect pathway MSNs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Calabresi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ding et al., 2010</a>). Cholinergic signaling can also modulate MSN excitability through increased GABAergic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib86\">Witten et al., 2010</a>). Crucially, these effects act at different time scales: M1 activity is longer lasting and slower to initiate than the pre-synaptic effects of M2 receptors (<a href=\"#bib76\">Shen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ding et al., 2010</a>). Thus, the different temporal dynamics receptor activity may interact with the time-course of the TAN response: whereas the TAN burst activates M1 receptors and increases excitability in indirect pathway MSNs, the subsequent TAN pause reduces M2-mediated presynaptic inhibition and postsynaptic GABAergic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</a>)."

No effects of M1 receptors were simulated during the action selection phase."

A phasic increase in TAN activity is commonly reported following the feedback related TAN pause (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aosaki et al., 2010)</a>. Mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors located on dopamine terminals in the striatum, the release of acetylcholine associated with a phasic increase in TAN activity evokes dopamine release (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cachope et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Threlfell et al., 2012</a>). The release of DA during the post\u2013pause phasic TAN burst may modulate cortico-straital plasticity in relation to activity during the feedback related pause DA release promotes spine growth specifically when stimulated after spiny neuron activity (<a href=\"#bib88\">Yagishita et al., 2014</a>). The effects of the post-pause TAN burst were modeled by simulating the modulation of dopamine release by nicotinic receptors through the modulation of the dopamine membrane potential during the plus phase. The observed dynamic range of effects were normed as change TAN firing rate above baseline from 0 to 1."

Note though that the network has no uncertainty. The term entropy here seems to obfuscate rather than clarify, but I think what they mean is that in an uncertain environment the network response is more spatially variable than in a certain environment. This leaves many questions. First, what is the origin of spatial variability in this network? I don't know how many units there are in this network, and have no idea why different units do not respond identically. Second, if there is this mapping from uncertainty to network variability, how does this happen? This is an example of a general problem with this paper, they run complex simulations and treat the results as an experimentalist would they describe the results, but seldom explain why the network generates these results."

The authors incorporate striatal ChIs into their previous computational model which successfully mimics the basal ganglia function in normal and Parkinsonism conditions. In this study, the authors tested the role of ChIs in acquisition and reversal learning, by simulating M1, M2 receptormediated currents on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and nicotinic receptor-mediated currents on GABAergic interneurons. The results replicated the experimental observations. In addition, the authors claimed that MSN entropy and ChIs pause feedback mechanism might control the pause duration which reveals a tradeoff between asymptotic accuracy and flexible learning."

This leaves many questions. First, what is the origin of spatial variability in this network? I don't know how many units there are in this network, and have no idea why different units do not respond identically.

We clarified throughout the manuscript (and including the equation in the text where it is first introduced) that the entropy we refer to is that over action selection. Thus although the units in the model are rate-coded, the population nevertheless can be more or less \u2018certain\u2019 in that activity can be more or less restricted to just the most dominant action or can be distributed across multiple alternative actions. This would be true even for a purely deterministic network, where uncertainty could still evolve with learning (synaptic weight changes that then affect the relative distribution of activity). But we note here that the network is also not a deterministic system \u2013 there is stochastic noise added to membrane potentials of cortical and striatal units, which aid in producing stochastic choices (exploration) early in learning before synaptic weights have evolved.

We have modeled some of the effects of the initial excitation (via M1 signaling). However, as we understand it, the main concern highlighted here is that the rebound burst may offset the effects of the pause that we simulate. However, the key point is that TAN signaling modulates the effect of dopamine on the excitability of recently active MSNs. It has recently been shown that DA promotes spine growth associated with synaptic plasticity only in a narrow time window (0.3 to 2 seconds) following glutamatergic input to the MSN, and only for the specific spines that were excited (Yagashita et al., 2014, Science). Thus the effects of TAN pauses would be to further enhance the excitability of relevant MSNs in the precise window during which DA modulates plasticity. The subsequent TAN rebound burst could further enhance DA signaling (via nicotinic receptors) that occurs immediately after this increase in excitability, which would only further enhance the plasticity credited to the recently active MSN (even if that MSN is now inactive due to the burst \u2013 the key point is that it was active a few hundred milliseconds prior, as per Yagashita et al.)."

This is analogous to the decay of the hyperparameters in the Bayesian model. In response to Reviewer 3, we have further adapted a simpler intermediate algorithmic model of striatal learning which summarizes the learning dynamics of the neural network (Collins & Frank, 2014), which similarly captures these weight divergences and feedback modulation thereof.

In this case, the downstream effects of TANs on MSN excitability and modulation of learning rate could still hold, as long as these excitatory signals provided to TANs covaried with a measure of uncertainty. fMRI correlates of an uncertainty signal have been identified in the frontal cortex and anterior cingulate (Behrens et al., 2007; McGuire et al. 2014), leaving open an alternative possibility that cortical inputs to TANs signal uncertainty.

As such, we believe it is appropriate to treat the normalized activity of units in the striatal layers as a discrete probability distribution over the set of actions available to the network. We also note that the interpretation of normalized unit activity as encoding probability is common in network models (Hinton & Sejnowski, 1983; Rao 2005; McClelland, 2013) and we now refer to these papers for the basic assumption. Finally, note that the activity of striatal units are closely analogous to actor weights in an algorithmic actor-critic model. In an actor-critic model, actor weights reflect the tendency of the model to select an action but these weights are not constrained by expected value and approximate the probability an action will be selected (via a sigmoidal choice function). The striatal units share this property. As such, we treat the normalized striatal unit activity as an approximation of the discrete probability distribution over the set of actions, not due to a lack of stochasticity in the network."
