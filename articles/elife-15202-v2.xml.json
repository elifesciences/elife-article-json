Channels can gate in sub-millisecond timescales, show complex manifolds of conformational states, and often show state-dependent pharmacology. Mechanistic studies of ion channels typically involve sophisticated voltage-clamp protocols applied through manual or automated electrophysiology. Here, we develop all-optical electrophysiology techniques to study activity-dependent modulation of ion channels, in a format compatible with high-throughput screening. Using optical electrophysiology, we recapitulate many voltage-clamp protocols and apply to Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, a channel implicated in pain. Optical measurements reveal that a sustained depolarization strongly potentiates the inhibitory effect of PF-04856264, a Na<sub>v</sub>1.7-specific blocker. In a pilot screen, we stratify a library of 320 FDA-approved compounds by binding mechanism and kinetics, and find close concordance with patch clamp measurements. Optical electrophysiology provides a favorable tradeoff between throughput and information content for studies of Na<sub>V</sub> channels, and possibly other voltage-gated channels."

When activated, these channels allow ions to pass through them, which can produce electrical spikes that carry information in nerve cells and regulate the beating of the heart. Researchers interested in understanding how ion channels behave often use a technique called patch clamp electrophysiology to measure the electrical current across the cell membrane. The technique can be used to probe if a specific drug can block an ion channel, but it is not well suited to screening lots of potential drugs because it is slow and expensive."

Zhang et al. used the new technique to probe how sodium channels, in particular Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, interact with drugs. Mammalian cells grown in the lab were engineered to produce Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, a light-activated ion channel (called CheRiff), and a fluorescent reporter protein. A flash of blue light delivered to the cells activated CheRiff, which in turn activated Na<sub>V</sub>1.7. At the same time, the fluorescence of the reporter protein was used as a read-out of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7\u2019s activity."

The results of the screen corresponded closely with measurements made using conventional electrophysiology. These results demonstrate that the new optical technique is both fast and precise enough to be used in drug discovery. Further studies could now ask if this optical technique can also be used to study other ion channels, such as potassium channels and calcium channels."

Knowledge of this state-dependent behavior is critical in developing models of channel function and in predicting how drugs will function in vivo.\u00a0State-dependent dynamical measurements are typically the domain of manual or automated patch clamp. Functionally equivalent optical assays would open the prospect of high throughput screens with sophisticated state-dependent selection criteria; and might enable measurements in cell types or environments (e.g. in a tissue or whole animal) that are challenging to access with conventional methods."

We then stably express four transgenic constructs: an inward rectifier potassium channel and a voltage-gated sodium channel imbue the HEK cells with the ability to produce regenerative electrical spikes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hsu et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kirkton and Bursac, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Park et al., 2013</a>). A channelrhodopsin variant, CheRiff, triggers these spikes upon exposure to flashes of blue light. An Archaerhodopsin variant, QuasAr2, enables fluorescent readout of membrane voltage via red excitation and near-infrared fluorescence. The QuasAr2 reporter has a ~1 ms response time and a linear response between \u2212100 to +100 mV, providing a direct correlation of fluorescence and voltage (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hochbaum et al., 2014</a>)."

Steady state illumination with blue light induces steady state changes in voltage, and thereby changes in the distribution of Na<sub>V</sub> channels among substates. We develop stimulus and data analysis protocols that are robust to sources of cellular variation, and we compare our results to measurements by manual patch clamp. While whole-cell voltage clamp remains the gold standard for absolute accuracy, optical electrophysiology provides a favorable tradeoff between accuracy and throughput."

There are nine subtypes of Na<sub>V</sub> channels in the human genome. Na<sub>V</sub> channel dysfunction has been implicated in many human diseases. For example, loss-of-function mutations in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 can cause Dravet syndrome and in Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 can cause Brugada syndrome (<a href=\"#bib7\">Catterall, 2012</a>). The Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 sodium channel plays an important role in mediating pain sensation. Homozygous loss of function leads to congenital insensitivity to pain (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cox et al., 2006</a>), gain of function mutations lead to spontaneous severe pain, called erythermalgia (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yang et al., 2004</a>), and nucleotide polymorphisms modify sensitivity to pain in the general population (<a href=\"#bib40\">Reimann et al., 2010</a>). While recent results have suggested that the connection of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 to pain may involve other signaling pathways as well (<a href=\"#bib30\">Minett et al., 2015</a>), there remains strong interest in finding selective blockers of this channel. Recent structural work has mapped an isoform-specific binding site for Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-specific blockers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahuja et al., 2015</a>), opening the possibility to develop new blockers via structure-guided design. Here we apply the Optopatch spiking HEK cell platform to study Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, and we demonstrate its applicability to Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 also."

Consistent with observations from traditional electrophysiology (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fertleman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Qiao et al., 2014</a>), carbamazepine reduced the overlap between activation and inactivation by leftward shifting the fast inactivation curve without altering the activation curve (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>).

Automated electrophysiology offers the advantage of direct control of voltage and measurement of current.

Patch clamp measurements also involve a perturbation to the integrity of the cell membrane, which can lead to changes in cytoplasmic composition and artifacts from mechanosensitive channels (<a href=\"#bib31\">Morton and Main, 2013</a>).

For data acquired at high magnification (60\u00d7), a rectangular ROI surrounding the cells of interest was manually selected. Background fluorescence was determined by measuring the mean intensity of a nearby cell free region and was subtracted from the cell fluorescence. For data acquired from cell monolayers under low magnification (20\u00d7), a rectangular ROI (400 \u00d7 208 pixels) covering the region with most intense laser illumination was selected. This ROI corresponds to a 320\u2009\u03bcm \u00d7 166\u2009\u03bcm area on the sample plane, containing approximately 150 cells. The mean intensity within this ROI was calculated for all frames of the tiff stack. To calculate \u0394F/F0, background fluorescence was determined by measuring the intensity from a well plated with parental HEK cells without QuasAr2 expression. After background subtraction, the data were further analyzed to extract spike parameters. Briefly, intensity traces were corrected for photobleaching by dividing the raw intensity by a median filtered copy of the intensity. Spike amplitude was defined as the difference between the maximum point of an action potential and the baseline. The use dependence index was defined as the fractional reduction of the spike amplitude averaged from the second to the eighth stimulus, compared to the initial stimulus."

The whole study is based on the occurrence of sodium-dependent regenerative depolarizations (spikes) produced by Na<sub>V</sub> channels. The figures displaying single-cell recordings of these spikes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) show that they occur in an all-or-none fashion, as expected from a dynamical system with Na<sub>V</sub> channels. Therefore, the appearance of partial blockade reported in the figures are obtained by averaging many cell, some of which are still able to generate spikes and others not. As a consequence, the range of modulation over which the technique is sensitive will depend heavily on the variability of Na<sub>V</sub> expression. If all the cells were expressing the same density of Na<sub>V</sub>, one would expect response curves being step functions, as all the cells would cross the threshold for regenerative spiking at the same level of channel modulation. This aspect must be quantified extensively by monitoring the dependence of the spike on channel density and by measuring the distribution of Na<sub>V</sub> channel expression in the polyclonal cell mixture, relative to the density threshold for regenerative spiking. Finally, the maximal plateau potential evoked by optogenetic stimulation looks dangerously close to spike threshold in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>.

Additionally, while establishing a proof of principle for all-optical screening using this new optogenetic toolset, the paper falls short of comparing quantitatively all-optical measurements with electrophysiological measurements.

None of the compounds affected CheRiff photocurrents. Seven of the eight compounds had no effect on QuasAr2 voltage sensitivity, while carbamazepine slightly decreased QuasAr2 voltage sensitivity, consistent with the optical assay for off-target effects. The small off-target effect of carbamazepine had no effect on our optical assays of activity-dependent block (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), because the analysis is insensitive to an overall scaling of the signal amplitude."
