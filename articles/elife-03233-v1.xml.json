Moreover, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels are predicted to double between now and the end of this century (<a href=\"#bib1\">IPCC, 2013</a>). Most plants respond to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations by growing faster, and it is possible that this enhanced growth might counteract some of the negative impacts of climate change on global food production, such as decreased agricultural output due to an increased frequency of floods and droughts."

This meta-analysis\u2014which is published in <i>eLife</i>\u2014analysed more than 7500 observations that cover 130 different plant species and crop varieties (<a href=\"#bib2\">Loladze, 2014</a>). Based on this unprecedentedly large dataset, Loladze was able to show that, when averaged across very different plant and tissue types, experimental approaches and locations, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> reduced the overall mineral content of plants by about 8%. At the same time, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> was shown to strongly increase the ratio of soluble carbohydrates (starch and sugars) to proteins."

Although decreased concentrations of nitrogen, protein, and other minerals have been previously observed, the size of these effects is often small and thus difficult to confirm with small sample sizes. Furthermore, not all elements are affected in the same way in different plant species and experiments. Despite these caveats, Loladze's meta-analysis shows a remarkable consistency in the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on the mineral concentrations across a wide range of plant species, including food crops."

Nevertheless, Loladze could show diminished mineral concentrations in edible parts of food crop plants from existing information. Further, he argues that the observed changes to the mineral content of food crops might exacerbate the problem of \u2018hidden hunger\u2019; that is, a person's diet can be deficient in minerals even if they consume enough calories. This type of malnutrition is common, particularly in developing countries, as many people eat only a limited number of staple crops, and do not eat enough mineral-rich foods\u2014such as fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats. Loladze also speculates that the changes in the carbohydrate to protein ratio caused by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> might contribute to the obesity epidemic."

However, both types of crops are known to lose less water from their tissues when grown at elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and thus the stimulation of photosynthesis and/or the improved water economy may contribute to the overall increase in growth. In contrast, the possible causes for the changes in plant tissue composition remain less clear. Previous studies have discussed the potential for a \u2018dilution effect\u2019 due to the surplus of carbohydrates, or a reduced plant uptake of minerals from the soil due to reduced water flow through the plant (<a href=\"#bib4\">McGrath and Lobell, 2013</a>)."
