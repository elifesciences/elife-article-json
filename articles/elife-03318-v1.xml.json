Consequently, the chromosome organization of microorganisms has been investigated in a few model species, but the extent to which the features described can be generalized to other taxa remains unknown. Using controlled mixes of bacterial and yeast species, we developed meta3C, a metagenomic chromosome conformation capture approach that allows characterizing individual genomes and their average organization within a mix of organisms. Not only can meta3C be applied to species already sequenced, but a single meta3C library can be used for assembling, scaffolding and characterizing the tridimensional organization of unknown genomes. By applying meta3C to a semi-complex environmental sample, we confirmed its promising potential. Overall, this first meta3C study highlights the remarkable diversity of microorganisms chromosome organization, while providing an elegant and integrated approach to metagenomic analysis."

Consequently, the chromosome organization of microorganisms has been investigated in a few model species, but the extent to which the features described can be generalized to other taxa remains unknown. Using controlled mixes of bacterial and yeast species, we developed meta3C, a metagenomic chromosome conformation capture approach that allows characterizing individual genomes and their average organization within a mix of organisms. Not only can meta3C be applied to species already sequenced, but a single meta3C library can be used for assembling, scaffolding and characterizing the tridimensional organization of unknown genomes. By applying meta3C to a semi-complex environmental sample, we confirmed its promising potential. Overall, this first meta3C study highlights the remarkable diversity of microorganisms chromosome organization, while providing an elegant and integrated approach to metagenomic analysis."

                        "text": "Microbial species have for a long time been studied individually, leading to the development of applications in fields as diverse as agronomy, environment, or medicine. Sequencing and analyzing the genetic material of microbial communities directly collected from various natural environments such as skin, gut, soil, and water have dramatically improved our knowledge and understanding of their diversity and interrelations (<a href=\"#bib21\">Handelsman et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Guermazi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">The Human Microbiome Jumpstart Reference Strains Consortium, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mackelprang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lundberg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Le Chatelier et al., 2013</a>). A number of techniques have been developed to improve the resolution and accuracy of individual genome assembly in mixed populations, for instance by separating the species prior to sequencing (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fitzsimons et al., 2013</a>) or by refining the clustering and scaffolding procedures used to process sequence data (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albertsen et al., 2013</a>). However, these approaches remain generally limited by the use of complex technologies and/or by the need to construct multiple libraries. In parallel, an interesting development in the field of genome assembly has recently arisen from the realization that the physical properties of chromosomes contain information regarding their linear structure. The frequency with which two chromosomal segments come in contact, as measured in genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (3C) experiments (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dekker et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</a>), obeys to some extent the laws of polymer physics (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rippe, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wong et al., 2012</a>). Contact frequencies can be used to identify synteny between DNA segments up to a few 100s kilobases (kb) apart, and two studies recently applied this concept to refining the human genome sequence (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kaplan and Dekker, 2013</a>). Such approach therefore shows great promise as a general method for improving genome assemblies. Using chromosomal contacts data in order to generate the precise scaffold of a given genome is however a difficult task: hence, we developed GRAAL, a robust and explicit statistical method to tackle this issue at the highest resolution possible (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marie-Nelly et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Since this approach enables the identification of individual chromosomes within the same nuclei, we hypothesized that tridimensional (3D) organization holds enough specific information to distinguish as well DNA segments of chromosomes present within different organisms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In other words, if the interactions between chromosomes contained within a human or a fungal nucleus can be resolved, then it may be possible to resolve the chromosomes of various species mixed together. In the present work, we show that this is indeed the case: a single meta3C experiment, performed on a mix of species, allows the de novo assembly and scaffolding of the various genomes present in the mixture without prior knowledge of their genome sequences. We also show that the method allows deciphering the average 3D organization of these genomes in space, unveiling a remarkable diversity of chromosome organization in microorganisms. Therefore, meta3C paves the way to the integrated characterization and analysis of metagenomes in complex populations."

The reads were aligned on the three reference genome sequences to generate a chromosome contact map of the whole population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To construct this map, each genome was divided into bins of 30 kb, and the contact frequencies were normalized so that their sum equaled one for each bin (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cournac et al., 2012</a>). As in a typical 3C experiment squares appeared on the diagonal of the matrix, revealing individual chromosomes: the circular chromosomes of both <i>E. coli</i> and <i>B. subtilis</i> were recovered as separate entities, whereas the two chromosomes of <i>V. cholerae</i> yielded two squares exhibiting higher contact frequencies with each other than with the chromosomes of the other species\u2014as expected since these chromosomes share the same cellular compartment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The background generated by cross-species interactions was low (0.37% of the total interactions), indicating that few chimeric pairs of reads (in which one read came from the genome of one species and the other read from the genome of another species) had been generated during the construction of the library (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The meta3C contact matrix was subsequently converted into a 3D structure (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Animation 1</a>). In this representation, bins are shown as beads and the distance between each pair of beads is optimized in proportion to the inverse of their measured contact frequency (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lesne et al., 2014</a>). Using this approach, we recovered three populations of bins that corresponded to the three bacterial genomes, with the two chromosomes of <i>V. cholerae</i> being visualized in close vicinity to each other. The continuity and circularity of each genome was clearly apparent in the reconstructed structures."

                                "text": "A sequence corresponding to a F plasmid (the fertility factor of <i>E. coli</i>) was characterized in the reads and appeared to interact with the genome of the <i>E. coli</i> HB101 strain used in the analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, black arrow). The 3D data provided us with the opportunity to carefully investigate the structure and spatial positioning of this plasmid with respect to the <i>E. coli</i> chromosome. We first noticed that a large (\u223c140 kb) region of the <i>E. coli</i> genome exhibited a two fold increase of the read coverage, indicating a segmental duplication. This region was also enriched in contacts with the F plasmid sequence (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>), prompting us to hypothesize that one of the two copy was actually carried by a F\u2019 plasmid (i.e., a F plasmid carrying bacterial sequences). A correlation analysis of the contacts between these two regions of interest (a chromosome region encompassing the duplication and the plasmid) revealed clearly that, on the one hand, a copy of the duplication is in close contact with the plasmid (with an IS2 at one the boundaries [coord. 390,063] and an IS3 within), and that on the other hand the plasmid contacts with the <i>E. coli</i> genome drop sharply past the duplication boundaries, in agreement with an integration of one copy of the duplication within a F\u2019 plasmid (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). This hypothesis was confirmed experimentally by a Southern blot of a pulsed-field gel (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Having deciphered the linear structure of the F\u2019 plasmid within this strain, we investigated its 3D organization with respect to the <i>E. coli</i> genome (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). The frequent contacts each copy of the duplication makes with both the chromosome and the F\u2019 plasmid resulted in an artifactual co-localization of the plasmid with the chromosome, since the contacts within each of the copies cannot be discriminated and are all positioned along the genome (see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>, i and <a href=\"#fig6\">Animation 2</a>). To alleviate this artifact, we generated a contact map were all the contacts involving the duplicated region were removed (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>, ii and <a href=\"#fig7\">Animation 3</a>). In the corresponding 3D structure, the bin representing the plasmid appeared now well isolated from the chromosome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). As a supplementary control, we verified that removing from the genome a region of a size similar to the duplication did not impair the 3D positioning of a DNA segment of a size similar to the F\u2019 plasmid, positioned within this deleted region (blue dot; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>, iii). Interestingly, besides this duplication, two regions along the <i>E. coli</i> chromosome appeared enriched in contacts with the F\u2019 plasmid: the replication origin (<i>Ori</i>) and, to a lower extent, the termination (<i>Ter</i>) regions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). This indicates that the F\u2019 plasmid is positioned preferentially in the vicinity of these regions in fast growing cells, as expected given the preferred location of the F plasmid in mid, 1/4, and 3/4 positions in the cell, which are also preferred positions for <i>Ori</i>/<i>Ter</i> regions during the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gordon et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Niki and Hiraga, 1997</a>). These results illustrate the high specificity of the meta3C approach, which allows the identification of genomic regions belonging to each species, and the power of using DNA physical contacts to decipher complex structures in individual genomes."

In <i>B. subtilis</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> this symmetry was made clearly visible, in the growth conditions used in this experiment, by the presence of a counter-diagonal in the map (running opposite to the continuous and strong signal that accounts for the contact between adjacent DNA segments; see also the correlation version of the contact map on <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

The 3D reconstruction of the <i>B. subtilis</i> genome revealed a relatively compact domain at the <i>Ori</i> region that overlapped with the region of the genome containing the centromere-like <i>parS</i> sites, in agreement with the structural role described for the ParS/Spo0J/Smc complex in the literature (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gruber and Errington, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sullivan et al., 2009</a>). By contrast, the <i>E. coli</i> chromosome presented a strong <i>Ter</i> domain that was clearly identifiable in the contact map and exhibited fewer contacts with the rest of the genome, reflecting most likely the structuring role of the MatP/<i>matS</i> system (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mercier et al., 2008</a>). For <i>V. cholerae</i>, the <i>Ter</i> regions of chromosomes 1 and 2 were in closer proximity than the two <i>Ori</i> regions, reflecting the controlled segregation mechanisms of these two unequal-sized chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Val et al., 2008</a>). Interchromosomal contacts did not span the entire length of chromosome 1 but started between the <i>Ori</i> macrodomain of chromosome 2 and positions located at about one-third of chromosome 1 arms (black dotted squares, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In order to visualize the interplay between replication and genomic organization, we applied a color code to represent the read coverage of the genome (reflecting the average progression of the replication fork and thus the relative timing of replication) atop the genome structure of <i>V. cholerae</i> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Animation 6</a>). Whereas the two <i>Ter</i> regions appeared of the same color, consistent with the fact that both chromosomes I and II achieve replication synchronously (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rasmussen et al., 2007</a>), the <i>Ori</i> regions presented, as expected, different coverages: chromosome I initiates replication first whereas chromosome II starts only to replicate later. This analysis provides a glimpse on the spatial and temporal articulation of the replication program of <i>V. cholerae</i>, which would be an interesting example of organization-dependent function. Overall, the chromosome organizations of the three bacteria analyzed (under the exponential, rich-medium growth conditions used in the experiment) appeared remarkably different but shared similar principles, such as the presence of well-defined domains. In order to see if those shared features are conserved across bacteria species, it will be interesting to use a similar high-resolution 3C approach to investigate the organization of bacterial linear chromosomes."

This relatively high percentage results from the fact that, unlike the Hi-C protocol (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</a>), meta3C does not involve an enrichment step for religated fragments (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Using the assembly program IDBA-UD (<a href=\"#bib41\">Peng et al., 2012</a>), a set of 2,436 contigs was generated from the 3C read pairs (N50 = 55 kb, total length 12.5 Mb). The quality of these contigs was assessed by comparing them with published reference genomes, which showed that the assembled contigs covered respectively 96%, 98%, and 93% of the <i>V. cholerae</i>, <i>E. coli</i>, and <i>B. subtilis</i> reference genomes and that only 0.7% of the contigs (52,373 bp total) were chimeric. The meta3C reads were then realigned on the de novo contigs and the contact information was used to pool the contigs into communities sharing similar contact behavior (hence likely belonging to the same genome) using the Louvain algorithm (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blondel et al., 2008</a>). Three communities of contigs were generated, each corresponding to a different species and covering respectively 96, 98, and 92% of the genomes of <i>V. cholerae</i>, <i>E. coli</i>, and <i>B. subtilis</i>, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

                                "text": "To see if this approach could be applied to a more complex mix of eukaryotic species, we pooled 11 yeast species and performed a meta3C experiment directly on this mixture (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The meta3C contact matrix of the 11 reference genomes put side by side presented discrete squares on the diagonal, each corresponding to a species from the mix (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The 3D representation of this contact map revealed, again, a very low level of background interactions in the experiment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig11\">Animation 7</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In each of the squares, the co-localization of centromeres resulting from the Rabl configuration was clearly visible (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, blue arrowheads; see also <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Duan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Marie-Nelly et al., 2014b</a>). In contrast to the diversity of structures observed for the bacterial species analyzed above, the Rabl configuration appeared as the primary driver of yeast genome organization, as illustrated by the individual 3D structures of the genomes of <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> and <i>Naumovozyma castellii</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig12\">Animation 8,9</a>). To test the potential of using meta3C reads for assembling de novo such a complex mix of yeast genomes, we assembled them using IDBA-UD (N50 = 6,914 bp, total length 138 Mb). The breadth of coverage of the 11 genomes by the resulting contigs ranged from 89.8% (<i>Candida albicans</i>) to 98.3% (<i>N. castellii</i>), with chimeric contigs (misassemblies) representing \u223c20% of the total (37 Mb). This high percentage of chimera contrasted with the very low level of misassemblies observed previously for the mix of three bacterial genomes. To monitor the influence of chimeric pairs of reads (originating from intergenomic 3D contacts) on the generation of chimeric contigs, we performed an assembly on the same library using the Velvet software that considers all reads as independents (i.e., without pairing them; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zerbino and Birney, 2008</a>). This assembly exhibited a dramatic increase (73%, 69 Mb) in chimeric contigs, demonstrating that these misassemblies were not caused by intergenomic 3C paired-end reads but rather by the frequent occurrence of identical or near-identical genome regions (such as transposable elements) in those eukaryotic genomes. The presence of chimeric contigs in the IDBA_UD assembly did not impede the clustering of the most contigs based on their contact frequencies as determined using the Louvain algorithm. The clustering procedure resulted in 13 sub-groups: one for each of the 11 yeast species, one corresponding to an <i>E. coli</i> contaminant, and one comprising various misassembled fragments of mitochondrial genomes. In total, only 1% of the assembly (2% of the contigs) could not be attributed to a given species (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). A de novo assembly followed by scaffolding using our dedicated program GRAAL (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marie-Nelly et al., 2014a</a>) was then applied to the pool of contigs identified as belonging to the genome of <i>N. castellii,</i> for which a high-quality reference sequence was available (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gordon et al., 2011</a>). Since this algorithm involves a splitting procedure of the contigs into restriction fragments, chimeric contigs were broken into non-chimeric parts thereby correcting the assembly errors mentioned above. After processing, 11 superscaffolds were recovered, with the reordered contact map presenting the typical co-localized centromeres regions expected from the Rabl configuration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#fig14\">Animation 10</a>). Overall these 11 scaffolds covered 94.5% of the reference sequence of the 10 chromosomes (chromosome 3 was split into two scaffolds because of the presence of the large, unassembled rDNA array on this chromosome), illustrating the ability of this de novo analysis to correctly assemble and scaffold unknown genomes (see <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The same approach was applied to other species in the mixture, such as <i>Saccharomyces bayanus</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cliften et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Scannell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Our de novo assembly of the genome of <i>S. bayanus</i> was more fragmented than the one of <i>N. castellii</i>, probably as a result of the lower sequencing depth for this species in the mixture (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>; <a href=\"#fig15\">Animation 11</a>). Interestingly, not only did de novo assembly and scaffolding from meta3C reads allow genome assembly from a mixed population, but the 3D organization of the assembled genomes was also apparent in the resulting contact maps. For instance, interchromosomal signals corresponding to centromere clustering were clearly visible in the matrix, emphasizing that 3D signals could also be used to annotate the centromeres of unknown species isolated from meta3C data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Marie-Nelly et al., 2014b</a>)."

                                "text": "As an even more challenging test of the meta3C approach, we confronted it with an environmental sample of unknown and presumably complex composition. For this purpose, sediments were collected from an affluent of the Seine river near Paris. Because environmental genomes usually contain a tremendous diversity of species, including many eukaryotes of large genome sizes, we decided to enrich our sample for prokaryotic organisms by cultivating it for 14 hr in Luria broth and filtrating it prior to meta3C library construction and sequencing. As an internal control of the assembly process, reads from a <i>V. cholerae</i> 3C library were added to the meta3C sequences before running IDBA-UD (N50 = 1.2 kb). Contigs generated from the meta3C sediment library were clustered using the Louvain algorithm, yielding 184 significant communities (total size 111 Mb, median size 300 kb, with 19 communities containing more than 1 Mb). The largest 11 ones were included in a contact matrix, revealing again squares along the diagonal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Each community was analyzed using MG-RAST (<a href=\"#bib15\">Glass et al., 2010</a>), showing relatively homogeneous taxonomic compositions in most communities (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For each community, more than 80% of the genes identified by MG-RAST within the contigs were attributed to the same taxonomic class. Going down to family level, 8 out of the 11 largest communities were &gt;80% homogeneous, with the remaining three presenting more complex patterns that will require further investigation and development. One community was composed of contigs covering 95% of the <i>V. cholerae</i> genome control (for a total amount of 3.9 Mb congruent with the expected size of the genome; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, i), confirming the ability of this approach to pool DNA regions according to their genome of origin. Other communities contained contigs belonging to other discrete species, related for instance to the ubiquitous bacteria <i>Aeromonas veronii</i> or <i>Exiguobacterium</i> sp. (for total amounts of 4 Mb and 3.1 Mb, aligning to 72% and 36% of the reference genomes of 4.5 Mb and 3 Mb total sizes, respectively; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, i). Several species belonging to the classes Bacilli and Enterobacteria were also present in the mix (probably favored by the LB enrichment step). In some instances, weak interactions between communities from these clades suggested that a genome had been split into more than one community or that two communities contained mixtures of closely related species (see dotted square on <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In spite of this problem the approach seemed to perform relatively well, as reflected by the analysis of the contacts with plasmids. Whether integrated in a genome or under circular forms (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), plasmids are expected to present mostly contacts with their host genome since they share the same cellular compartment (see also the contacts of plasmid F with the <i>E. coli</i> genome in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In this study, plasmids annotated as belonging to <i>Bacillus megaterium</i> were retrieved almost entirely within a single Bacilli community (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, ii), suggesting that this community presented indeed a relatively homogeneous content and therefore validating our approach. Although the limited sequencing depth of our experiment restrained our ability to scaffold optimally the contigs of the communities using GRAAL, mapping the reads present in the community related to <i>A. veronii</i> against the reference genome of this species revealed a 3D structure reminiscent of those of <i>B. subtilis</i> and <i>C. crescentus</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; <a href=\"#fig16\">Animation 12</a>). Hence, the 3D information contained within the chromosome of this species was efficiently captured during the meta3C experiment, suggesting that increasing the sequencing depth of a meta3C library will likely make it possible to generate de novo scaffolds and 3D clusters for genomes entirely unknown or underrepresented, shedding light at the same time onto their overall organization."

The significant communities can be annotated by NCBI and correspond principally to sequences from individual species. Ultimately, the contact information can be used to reorder the DNA segments within each community and thus generate the 3D contact map of the corresponding species. In this process contigs can be reassembled by software such as GRAAL, thereby decreasing the percentage of chimeric fragments in the assembly and improving its continuity. DNA segments originating from other species are put aside automatically during this process given their lack of 3C contacts with the rest of the genome under reassembly."

Most of the organization in Saccharomycetes appears driven by the clustering of the centromeres at the spindle pole body; this clustering remains the prominent structural feature throughout most of the cell cycle (i.e., G1 + S phase + G2) during exponential growth, with mitosis representing only a fraction of the cycle. In bacteria, in contrary, the strong overall organizational features are the activation of a unique replication origin per chromosome, the ability to initiate multiple replication forks, and the fast division cycle. In addition, important topological constraints are exerted on bacterial circular chromosomes around the <i>Ter</i> regions, and our observation of significant contacts at these positions was probably linked to these phenomena. More imaging and 3C-like analyses will be required to understand the precise choreography of chromosome segregation in these different microorganisms."

Although these analyses open interesting perspectives, the meta3C approach presented in this work differs in several aspects. First, both studies used HiC to scafold genomes from contigs obtained either from simulated assemblies (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beitel et al., 2014</a>) or from independent experiments (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burton et al., 2014</a>). Our approach conveniently uses a single meta3C library and a blind analysis for generating contigs, binning them, scaffolding them, and revealing the 3D structure of the corresponding species. Such approach based on a single experiment may require more sequencing depth than an approach combining multiple libraries (HiC + shotgun + mate pair, for instance), but the exact trade-off remains to be determined and depends on the specifics of the experiment, the sequencing technology, and on the amount of starting material available."

The adequacy between the cross-linking step, which depends on the incubation time and the concentration of the fixating agent, and the restriction step and choice of the restriction enzyme, is essential for the recovery of long-distance <i>cis</i> contacts that improve de novo genome scaffolding and, importantly, reveal the 3D structure. Optimizing the cross-linking conditions allows new insights into the diversity of 3D chromosome organization of several species."

Based on our experience, we envision that, this experiment should include several (two at least) enzymes recognizing sites with various GC percentages, in order for both GC-rich and GC-poor genomes to be appropriately represented in the meta3C library. Doing the experiment with multiple enzymes would also allow taking into account GC content (in addition to average coverage) to improve the binning of contigs into communities. Identifying contigs presenting largely divergent characteristics compared to their neighbors and redistributing them to their most likely communities would also lead to improved assemblies for each species (see for instance <a href=\"#bib1\">Albertsen et al., 2013</a>). Overall, quantifying physical contacts between chromosomes provides an objective and convenient principle to segregate the genomes of sympatric species and, from there, to explore the biological diversity of complex ecosystems."

More than 95% (\u223c3,880,000) of the initial reads mapped on the contigs. These contigs were mapped against the reference genomes of the different bacteria using BLAT (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kent, 2002</a>). Analyzing the output revealed that 30 and 14 of these contigs covered 96.0% (2,957,563 bp) and 96.1% (1,071,728 bp) of chromosomes 1 and 2 of <i>V. cholerae</i>, respectively. Another group of 55 contigs covered 98.4% (4,630,934 bp) of the genome of <i>E. coli</i>, whereas a group of 1441 contigs covered 92.5% (3,957,375 bp) of the genome of <i>B. subtilis</i> (a higher fragmentation reflecting the lower representation of this bacterium in the mix). We also quantified the amount of chimeric contigs in the assembly using BEDtools (<a href=\"#bib42\">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</a>). Such chimeric contigs may occur because of the presence of repeated conserved sequences between bacteria, such as transposons, or because of the background interactions introduced by chimeric religation between restriction fragments belonging to different species. Only 17 out of the 2436 contigs were chimeric (0.7%), accounting for 52,373 bp in total (0.4% of the total size of the assembly). This relatively low number probably results from the limited number of species contained in the mix and their low repeat content. It also shows that chimeric religation during the experiment introduces little background interactions in the assembly process."

When mapped against the newly generated contigs, 47 M reads (\u223c78%) did align. These contigs were then compared with the reference genomes of the different yeasts using BLAT and the analysis of the output was performed as above. Genome breadths of coverage ranged from 89% (<i>Y. lipolytica</i>) to 98% (<i>N. castellii</i>). In contrast to the previous results on the bacterial meta3C assembly, there were 9,599 chimeric contigs in the yeast case, representing 27.1% of the total number of contigs. This shows that chimeric contigs arise when dealing with mixtures of repeat-rich genomes, likely because near-identical repeats (such as transposable elements) are found in different genomes in the mixture. Such assembly mistakes will be probably avoided if using longer reads (since repeats longer than the read length pose problem during assembly) or, alternatively, can be resolved a posteriori using GRAAL. Despite the high percentage of chimeric contigs, we were able to assemble \u223c95% of the <i>N. castellii</i> genome from the meta3C reads."

Before applying the algorithm, contigs longer than 2.5 kb were divided into equal-sized chunks corresponding to several nodes in the graph (since large contigs exhibit more contact than smaller ones, they are more prone to clustering when running the Louvain algorithm). We used the Louvain method with default parameters, except for the mix of three bacteria (r=10 for three communities). For bacterial mix, 10% of the contigs of the smallest size were not attributed to a community with these parameters (representing \u223c15% of the total reads). For yeast, few contigs were left aside, representing in total \u223c2% of the number of reads. For the river sediment experiment, \u223c15% of the contigs were left aside at the binning step. The contigs in each bin resulting from the 3D binning were characterized using BLAST to determine the dominant species."

The program only needs two datasets for initialization: a set of contigs and a 3C/HiC dataset. Upon initialization and depending on the depth of the HiC dataset, the software splits the contigs into smaller pieces/bins encompassing at least 2 restriction fragments. It then iteratively (over 1000s of steps) searches through a broad range of structures generated from reordering these small bins for genome structures more likely to be true given the 3D data. Importantly, at each step, a bin is tested for a variety of \u2018structural variations\u2019 with respect to its most likely neighbors, including duplications, deletions, fusions, inversion, etc. The likelihood of each of these new genome structures is then computed in light of the contact data, and one of those structures is sampled for the next iteration (during which the position of a new bin is tested). Each bin is tested several times throughout the entire process, and step by step the genome structure originally made of thousands of small independent bins converges towards a structure reflecting the best solution given the 3D contact data."

These layouts allowed us to visualize conveniently large clusters of nodes that were subsequently confirmed by the use of the Louvain algorithm.

For visualizing the meta3C bacterial assembly we used the Force Atlas 2 algorithm (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jacomy et al., 2014</a>). This algorithm assigns spring-like attractive forces and repulsive forces (like those between electrically charged particles) to the set of edges and the set of nodes: in the equilibrium state, discrete clusters are obtained.

We have performed an in-depth analysis of the behavior of the plasmid F and revised our interpretation. Since the plasmid exhibited frequent contacts with a discrete region of the <i>E. coli</i> chromosome, we initially concluded that the plasmid had become integrated. However, upon closer examination of the sequence coverage we realized that the large (170kb) region of the <i>E. coli</i> chromosome that was in contact with the plasmid appeared duplicated in that strain. This raised the possibility that the duplicated chromosomal region showing high contact frequency was actually carried by the F plasmid. Analyzing the contacts between the plasmid F specific sequence and the <i>E. coli</i> genome we could identify a high contact correlation between the plasmid and the duplication. Such similarity of behavior with such sharp drops at the boundaries clearly indicated that the duplication was carried by the plasmid, which we confirmed using PFGE and Southern hybridization of specific probes."

This region was also enriched in contacts with the F plasmid sequence (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2A, B</a>), prompting us to hypothesize that one of the two copy was carried by the plasmid. A correlation analysis of the contacts between these two regions of interest (a chromosome region encompassing the duplication, and the plasmid) revealed clearly that, on the one hand, a copy of the duplication is in close contact with the F plasmid (with an IS2 at one the boundaries [coord. 390,063] and an IS3 within), and that on the other hand the plasmid contacts with the <i>E. coli</i> genome drop sharply past the duplication boundaries, in agreement with an integration of one copy of the duplication within the plasmid (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2C</a>). This hypothesis was confirmed experimentally by a Southern blot of a pulsed-field gel (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2D</a>). Having deciphered the linear structure of the F plasmid within this strain, we investigated its 3D organization with respect to the <i>E. coli</i> genome (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2E</a>). The frequent contacts each copy of the duplication makes with either the chromosome and the F plasmid resulted in an artifactual colocalization of the plasmid with the chromosome, since the contacts within each of the copies cannot be discriminated and are all positioned along the genome (see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2E</a>, i and Animation 3). To solve this bias, the contacts involving the duplicated region were removed and the 3D structure of the resulting was generated (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2E</a>, ii and Animation 2). In the resulting structure, the bin representing the plasmid appeared now well isolated from the chromosome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). As a supplementary control, we verified that removing from the genome a region of a size similar to the duplication did not impair the 3D positioning a DNA segment of a size similar to the F plasmid, positioned within this deleted region (blue dot; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2E</a>, iii). Interestingly, besides this duplication, two regions along the <i>E. coli</i> chromosome appeared enriched in contacts with the F plasmid: the replication origin (<i>Ori</i>) and, to a lower extent, the termination (<i>Ter</i>) regions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2B</a>). This that the F plasmid is positioned preferentially in the vicinity of these regions in fast growing cells, as expected given the preferred location of the F plasmid in mid, 1/4 and 3/4 positions in the cell, which are also preferred positions for <i>Ori</i>/<i>Ter</i> regions during the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gordon et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Niki and Hiraga, 1997</a>). These results illustrate the high specificity of the meta3C approach, which allows the identification of genomic regions belonging to each species, and the power of using DNA physical contacts to decipher complex structures in individual genomes."

Although these analyses open interesting perspectives, the meta3C approach presented in this work differs in several aspects.

Our approach conveniently uses a single meta3C library and a blind analysis for generating contigs, binning them, scaffolding them and revealing the 3D structure of the corresponding species. Such approach based on a single experiment may require more sequencing depth than an approach combining multiple libraries (HiC + shotgun + mate pair, for instance), but the exact trade-off remains to be determined and depends on the specifics of the experiment, the sequencing technology, and on the amount of starting material available."

Our approach conveniently uses a single meta3C library and a blind analysis for generating contigs, binning them, scaffolding them and revealing the 3D structure of the corresponding species. Such approach based on a single experiment may require more sequencing depth than an approach combining multiple libraries (HiC + shotgun + mate pair, for instance), but the exact trade-off remains to be determined and depends on the specifics of the experiment, the sequencing technology, and on the amount of starting material available.\u201d"

Most of the organization in Saccharomycetes appeared driven by the clustering of the centromeres at the spindle-pole bod; this clustering remains the prominent structural feature throughout most of the cell cycle (i.e., G1 + S phase + G2) during exponential growth, with mitosis representing only a fraction of the cycle. In bacterial, in contrary, the strong overall organizational features are the activation of a unique replication origin per chromosome, the ability to initiate multiple replication forks, and the fast division cycle. In addition, important topological constraints are exerted on bacterial circular chromosomes around the <i>Ter</i> regions, and our observation of significant contacts at these positions was probably linked to these phenomena. More imaging and 3C-like analyses will be required to understand the precise choreography of chromosome segregation in these different microorganisms.\u201d"
