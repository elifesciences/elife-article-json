Here we report a cancer-promoting role for ATM. ATM depletion in metastatic cancer cells reduced cell migration and invasion. Transcription analyses identified a gene network, including the chemokine IL-8, regulated by ATM. <i>IL-8</i> expression required ATM and was regulated by oxidative stress. IL-8 was validated as an ATM target by its ability to rescue cell migration and invasion defects in ATM-depleted cells. Finally, ATM-depletion in human breast cancer cells reduced lung tumors in a mouse xenograft model and clinical data validated IL-8 in lung metastasis. These findings provide insights into how ATM activation by oxidative stress regulates <i>IL-8</i> to sustain cell migration and invasion in cancer cells to promote metastatic potential. Thus, in addition to well-established roles in tumor suppression, these findings identify a role for ATM in tumor progression."

Here we report a cancer-promoting role for ATM. ATM depletion in metastatic cancer cells reduced cell migration and invasion. Transcription analyses identified a gene network, including the chemokine IL-8, regulated by ATM. <i>IL-8</i> expression required ATM and was regulated by oxidative stress. IL-8 was validated as an ATM target by its ability to rescue cell migration and invasion defects in ATM-depleted cells. Finally, ATM-depletion in human breast cancer cells reduced lung tumors in a mouse xenograft model and clinical data validated IL-8 in lung metastasis. These findings provide insights into how ATM activation by oxidative stress regulates <i>IL-8</i> to sustain cell migration and invasion in cancer cells to promote metastatic potential. Thus, in addition to well-established roles in tumor suppression, these findings identify a role for ATM in tumor progression."

Chen et al. found that activating ATM through oxidative stress, but not by DNA damage, encouraged the cancer cells to migrate and become invasive. Further analysis of cellular responses following ATM activation by oxidative stress revealed that this enzyme regulates the production of a small protein called interleukin-8. This protein is an important pro-inflammatory molecule that has been implicated in cancer, in particular, in helping cancer cells to migrate to other tissues. When interleukin-8 was added to ATM-depleted cancer cells, it rescued their defects in spreading and invasiveness, thereby providing strong evidence that interleukin-8 is a biologically important target of ATM."

These cancer therapies activate complex signaling networks, termed the DNA damage response (DDR), that detect and signal the presence of DNA damage to promote cell cycle arrest and DNA repair (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</a>). The apical protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) initiates a large signaling cascade in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by phosphorylating many key proteins, including the tumor suppressor p53, to orchestrate the DDR (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shiloh and Ziv, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Stracker et al., 2013</a>). The DDR regulates cell fate decision pathways including apoptosis, senescence and differentiation. Many of these pathways depend on ATM and/or p53 to enforce tumor suppressive anti-cancer barriers to limit proliferation in response to, and in the presence of, DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib51\">Norbury and Zhivotovsky, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bartkova et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gorgoulis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bartkova et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Di Micco et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Vousden and Lane, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sherman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Roos and Kaina, 2013</a>). However, cancer cells exhibit genome instability (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</a>) and often contain endogenous oxidative and replicative damage that can promote genetic alterations to drive malignant transformation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Klaunig et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hills and Diffley, 2014</a>). Cancer cells evolve a defective DDR to allow cell proliferation in the presence of DNA damage, furthering genome instability and cancer progression. Defects in the DDR can also profoundly influence DNA damage-dependent therapies both positively and negatively (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bouwman and Jonkers, 2012</a>). Thus, DDRs can influence both cancer promoting and suppressing mechanisms. This concept is perhaps best exemplified by p53, which is normally activated by stress signals and promotes tumor suppressor pathways (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bieging et al., 2014</a>). However, the tumor-associated gain-of-function p53 mutations that are most commonly observed in human cancers exhibit several tumor-promoting functions (<a href=\"#bib50\">Muller and Vousden, 2013</a>). Thus, tumor suppressive or promoting activities from the same protein can be dictated by many factors including mutations, cell type, and/or disease context."

Several of the pathological outcomes in ATM deficient mice have been linked to ROS and many of these pathologies can be reversed by the addition of antioxidants, highlighting the important role of ATM in regulating redox-homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ito et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Reliene and Schiestl, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Reliene et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Freund et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Okuno et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">D'Souza et al., 2013</a>). In addition, ATM can be directly activated by ROS, independently from DSB signaling, and has been implicated in mitochondrial quality control, potentially through an ability to localize to mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib27\">Guo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Valentin-Vega et al., 2012</a>).

NF-\u03baB signaling can be regulated by ATM through the phosphorylation of NEMO, which aids in transmitting nuclear ATM signaling to activate NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wu et al., 2006</a>). Upon activation, NF-\u03baB translocates to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression and influences cell survival pathways. Understanding the crosstalk between the NF-\u03baB and ATM signaling in complex pathologies including inflammation and cancer remains an area of active investigation."

Metastasis occurs when a tumor spreads by means of cell migration and invasion to a secondary site, a process linked with the majority of cancer deaths (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</a>). Several pathways suppress this dangerous process as part of tumor suppressive mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mehlen and Puisieux, 2006</a>). Although the role of DNA damage and the DDR in this process has not been extensively explored experimentally, increased genomic instability due to the acquisition of DDR defects has been proposed to play a role in the acquisition of these traits based on human patient data (<a href=\"#bib29\">Halazonetis et al., 2008</a>)."

Our data is consistent with endogenous oxidative stress triggering these responses independently from DSB signaling. Gene expression analysis identified an ATM and mutant p53 transcriptional program that contained pro-migration and invasion genes, including interleukin-8 (IL-8). Addition of IL-8 rescued defects in cell migration and invasion observed in ATM-depleted cells thus validating this target. Consistent with the biological relevance of these findings, ATM promoted tumor formation in a xenograft human breast cancer cell model. Based on the data, we propose a non-canonical role for ATM in supporting pro-tumorigenic behavior of cancer cells."

DNA damage, including ionizing radiation (IR), topoisomerase II poisons etoposide (Et) and doxorubicin (Dox), had little effect on cell migration in the highly metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 as measured by wound healing assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Induction of the DNA damage marker, phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (\u03b3H2AX), confirmed DNA DSBs formations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These treatments arrested the cell cycle and inhibited proliferation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>).

As ATM mediates many initial DNA damage signaling events and regulates multiple cellular responses to DNA damage, we tested its role in cell migration. Strikingly, ATM depletion reduced cell migration in the presence or absence of IR-induced damage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Increased DDR signaling as evidenced by phosphorylated H2AX, p53 and KAP1 confirmed DNA damage by IR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We independently verified the requirement of ATM for cell migration and invasion using an xCelligence system that measures cell migration and invasion, as well as proliferation in real-time and in the same cell populations which provides standardized experimental conditions. Reduced invasion and migration in ATM-depleted cells was independent from proliferation as control and ATM-depleted cells grew similarly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Experiments with two additional independent ATM siRNAs confirmed these observations thus ruling out possible off-target effects by siRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, ATM promotes cell migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells in the absence of exogenous DNA damage."

DSBs activate ATM through interactions with the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex. ATM phosphorylates many targets, including the effector kinase CHK2, which collectively orchestrate the DDR (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lee and Paull, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Matsuoka et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Shiloh and Ziv, 2013</a>). ATM is also activated by oxidative stress independently of DSBs, MRN or CHK2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Guo et al., 2010</a>), although the downstream pathways reliant on this ATM activation are unclear. In contrast to ATM inhibition, depletion of CHK2, MRE11 or NBS1 did not reduce cell migration, suggesting ATM-mediated cell migration occurred independently of DSB-dependent ATM activation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; depletion analysis shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, we hypothesized that ATM could promote migration through oxidative stress. In support of this idea, chemical inhibition of oxidative stress in MDA-MB-231 cells using the reducing agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced cell migration similarly as depletion of ATM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also showed that NAC treatment inhibits intracellular oxidative stress (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). To rule out any influence of proliferation on cell migration in our analyses, we performed live-cell imaging to track the migration of individual cells. We found reduced cell motility in cells treated with NAC compared with control cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1, 2</a>). These data suggest that ATM, independent from DSB signaling, promotes cell migration."

                                "text": "While DSBs trigger ATM-dependent phosphorylation of more than 1000 proteins (<a href=\"#bib44\">Matsuoka et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bennetzen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bensimon et al., 2010</a>), very few targets of ATM in response to other types of damage, including oxidative stress, are known (<a href=\"#bib27\">Guo et al., 2010</a>). However, p53 is phosphorylated by ATM after oxidative stress and mutant p53 is involved in TGF\u03b2-dependent cell migration in MDA-MB-231 cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adorno et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Guo et al., 2010</a>). We therefore speculated that mutant p53 could act in concert with ATM to promote cell migration. To test this hypothesis, we depleted ATM, mutant p53 or both and analyzed cell migration. As expected, inhibition of mutant p53 resulted in reduced cell migration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Interestingly, co-depletion of ATM and mutant p53 resulted in a similar reduction of cell migration as either single gene knockdown alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We confirmed and extended these results using real-time, simultaneous analyses of proliferation, migration and invasion. Although mutant p53 depletion mildly reduced proliferation, co-depletion of ATM resulted in an epistatic reduction of cell migration and invasion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Live-cell imaging of migrating cells revealed reduced speed and migration path length in ATM and mutant p53 depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3\u20135</a>). These results further corroborate the role of ATM and mutant p53 in promoting cell migration, independently from cell proliferation. These results are consistent with our analyses of DNA damaging agents, which inhibit proliferation without altering cell migration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D</a>). We repeated these experiments in the highly metastatic BT-549 breast cancer cells that have mutant p53. Consistent with results from MDA-MB-231 cells, depletion of ATM reduced cell migration by \u223c 60% in BT-549 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). ATM and/or mutant p53-depleted BT-549 cells exhibited similar levels of migration (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), which is in accord with data obtained in MDA-MB-231 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). Taken together, these results from multiple human cancer cell lines suggest that ATM and mutant p53 are required for the cell migration and invasion phenotypes observed in these highly invasive cancer cell lines."

                                "text": "We next investigated the molecular mechanism by which ATM promotes cell migration and invasion. The identification of an epistatic relationship between ATM and mutant p53 in promoting cell migration pointed towards a common molecular pathway. Given the role of mutant p53 in transcriptional regulation, we hypothesized that ATM could similarly regulate the expression of genes involved in cell migration (<a href=\"#bib58\">Riley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Shiloh and Ziv, 2013</a>). Therefore, we performed a microarray-based comparative gene expression analysis in control, ATM and mutant p53 siRNA-treated cells. Out of the hundreds of genes in ATM-depleted cells whose mRNA levels were differentially regulated more than 1.5-fold compared to control siNon-coding (siNC) cells, only \u223c40 genes showed equivalent regulation between siATM and si mutant p53 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A,B</a>). We observed comparable numbers of co-regulated genes that were either up-regulated or down-regulated similarly in both siATM and si mutant p53 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that genes involved in the response to wound healing, including cell migration genes, were in the top 10 GO categories for both ATM and mutant p53 depleted samples (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). GO analysis of genes co-regulated by ATM and mutant p53 identified almost exclusively pathways involving cell migration (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>) in agreement with our data showing reduced migration in ATM or mutant p53 deficient cells. Collectively these data support a role for mutant p53 and ATM in the co-regulation of a gene network regulating cell migration under these conditions."

The <i>IL-8</i> promoter contains many transcription factor binding sites, including NF-\u03baB, which regulates IL-8 expression and is linked to the DDR through ATM activation by DSBs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mukaida et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib11a\">Biton and Ashkenazi, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">McCool and Miyamoto, 2012</a>). We confirmed <i>IL-8</i> promoter regulation by NF-\u03baB as \u223c90% of IL-8 promoter activity was lost by mutating the NF-\u03baB binding site (mut IL-8, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Interestingly, depletion of ATM or mutant p53 reduced <i>IL-8</i> promoter activity similarly as mut <i>IL-8</i>, showing ATM regulation of <i>IL-8</i> occurs at the transcriptional level (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). As expected, we observed that depletion of NF-\u03baB p65, a subunit of NF-\u03baB dimer, or NEMO abrogated <i>IL-8</i> expression in MDA-MB-231 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">Freund et al., 2004</a>). Both ATM and p53 are known to be required for NF-\u03baB localization and activation in the nucleus upon various stimuli including cellular stress (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wuerzberger-Davis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hoesel and Schmid, 2013</a>). To determine whether NF-\u03baB function required ATM or mutant p53 in our cell system, we investigated the nuclear localization of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 in MDA-MB-231 cells under normal growth conditions. Nuclear localization of the p50/p65 NF-\u03baB dimer enables transcriptional activation of this complex so we analyzed p65 nuclear accumulation as a readout of NF-\u03baB localization (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hayden and Ghosh, 2012</a>). We observed reduced p65 nuclear localization and NEMO phosphorylation in ATM- and mutant p53-depleted cells compared to control cells, which is inline with the reduced <i>IL-8</i> expression that occurs under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>). We next performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of NF-\u03baB on the <i>IL-8</i> promoter to analyze directly the involvement of NF-\u03baB in regulating <i>IL-8</i> transcription and how this is affected by ATM and mutant p53. ChIP analyses revealed that reduced levels of ATM or mutant p53 impaired NF-\u03baB accumulation on the IL-8 promoter (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>)."

                                "text": "To examine the influence of ATM on tumor growth in vivo, we then orthotopically injected these cells into the mammary fat pad. There, we observed an increase in primary tumor growth, consistent with the well-established role of ATM in tumor suppression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). To address whether ATM depletion could influence the ability of these cells to colonize secondary sites, we performed tail vein injections with shATM and shNC MDA-MB 231 cells and assessed lung colonization after 9 weeks. In contrast to the pro-tumorigenic effects of ATM depletion on primary growth, lung colonization was strongly suppressed in cells with reduced ATM levels compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>), consistent with the ability of ATM activity to regulate IL-8 mediated cell migration and invasion capacity. To examine the relationship between ATM and IL-8 expression and metastasis in human breast cancer, we analyzed a set of expression arrays from 560 breast cancer patients with clinical annotation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Morales et al., 2014</a>). The expression of IL-8 was significantly associated with metastasis to the lung but not bone or brain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). These data suggest that IL-8, and potentially ATM, do not affect all metastatic processes similarly in all tissues. The mRNA expression levels of ATM were not similarly associated with the probability of metastasis, however, ATM is regulated primarily at the post-transcriptional level and these analyses do not reflect its activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that ATM can play dual functions in breast cancer tumor progression. On the one hand, ATM serves as a tumor suppressor to limit the proliferation or survival of cancer cells during primary tumor formation. However, based on our findings, ATM can also promote pro-metastatic processes such as lung colonization. These functions of ATM are likely through its ability to control the transcription of key regulators, including IL-8, that promote cell migration and invasion to influence metastatic colonization."

                        "text": "In summary, we have identified a tumor promoting activity for ATM. Our data is consistent with this pathways being triggered by intrinsic oxidative stress that occurs in highly metastatic cancer cells. This ATM-dependent pathway regulates the transcription of pro-metastatic genes including <i>IL-8</i> through the activation of the transcriptional regulator NF-\u03baB. The expression of these genes, including <i>IL-8</i>, results in increased cell migration and invasion that aid in tumor progression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). ATM is known to regulate several pro-inflammatory cytokines as part of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in senescent cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rodier et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Coppe et al., 2010</a>). The SASP can be mediated by DNA damage induced ATM signaling through MRN and CHK2, but not p53. In addition, a role for p38 MAPK in the SASP has been defined that is independent of the initial ATM-dependent damage response (<a href=\"#bib23\">Freund et al., 2011</a>). Senescent cells are thought to promote tumor progression in the microenvironment through paracrine signaling by secreted pro-inflammatory factors including cytokines (<a href=\"#bib17\">Coppe et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2010</a>). ATM has also been shown to regulate IL-8 secretion in response to DSB formation by etoposide, which is dependent on NF-\u03baB and NEMO but independent from p53 (<a href=\"#bib11a\">Biton and Ashkenazi., 2011</a>). From our data, we conclude that ATM, through a pathway requiring mutant p53, can support a transcriptional program that includes several pro-metastatic genes including IL-8 that maintain cell migration and invasion. These processes are operational in cancer cells and have the ability to support cellular activities contributing to tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a recent study identified a fundamentally different type of anti-cancer pathway mediated by ATM in a MLL-AF9 driven acute myeloid leukemia model (<a href=\"#bib62\">Santos et al., 2014</a>). In this instance, ATM was required to block the differentiation capacity of these cells, thereby promoting their tumorigenic properties. p38 MAPK plays both pro and anti-tumorigenic roles and its downregulation has been demonstrated to reduce tumor growth and survival but also to promote the metastasis of colorectal cancer to the lung through the modulation of inflammatory responses (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gupta et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Urosevic et al., 2014</a>). Thus, emerging evidence indicates that ATM represents another DDR factor that, like p53 or p38, can differentially influence pathways relevant to diverse aspects of tumorigenesis in a context dependent manner."

Comparative expression analysis revealed wound healing as a major pathway regulated by both ATM and mutant p53. Several pro-metastatic genes from this analysis in addition to <i>IL-8</i>, including <i>CXCL11, CCL2</i>, <i>MMP1</i> and <i>SAA2</i>, were identified. By identifying <i>IL-8</i> as a target of oxidative stress and ATM, we provide a link between activated ATM by oxidative stress and pro-metastatic pathways operating in cancer cells. Our results provide additional insights into other disease pathways involving ATM including angiogenesis, a pathway triggered by oxidative stress and dependent on IL-8 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Koch et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Okuno et al., 2012</a>). Inhibitors of the IL-8 pathway are actively being developed and evaluated in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for cancer and inflammatory diseases (<a href=\"#bib72\">Waugh and Wilson, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Singh et al., 2013</a>). Our work provides a rationale for evaluating the clinical efficacy of IL-8 inhibition in the context of lung metastasis, including the use of ATM inhibitors beyond their ability to radio-sensitize cancer cells. It is intriguing that high IL-8 expression levels in breast cancers were specifically correlated with lung metastasis, a tissue location with high oxygen burden (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rosanna and Salvatore, 2012</a>). Thus, regulation of IL-8 by ATM could promote a metastatic program that is important in an organ-specific context where oxidative stress and cytokine secretion occur. We hypothesize based on our findings that targeting ATM could inhibit IL-8 dependent processes involving tumor progression and metastasis in certain cancers. In addition, based on our study and those of others, ATM inhibition could also be efficacious in the setting of other diseases involving oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines including inflammation, angiogenesis and aging (<a href=\"#bib54\">Osorio et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Okuno et al., 2012</a>)."

The PCR fragment was then subcloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The IL-8 promoter was cut with XhoI and BglII and cloned into Xho1/BglII treated pNANOG-Luc (Addgene No. 25900). After sequencing, this IL-8 promoter driven luciferase construct was named as pIL8-Luc. As a negative control, we made another IL-8 reporter with mutated NF-\u03baB binding (named as mut pIL8-Luc) by using pIL8-Luc as a template and the following primers:"

When cells contact and adhere to electrical sensors, this leads to increasing electrical impedance. The impedance correlates with an increase in proliferating, migrated or invaded cells, derived as a parameter called cell index. For proliferation experiment, cells were treated as indicated and seeded in quadruplicates on E-plate. For migration and invasion assays, following indicated treatments, cells were starved in serum-free medium overnight and seeded in quadruplicates on CIM-plate. Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was diluted in serum-free medium at a ratio of 1:40 and coated on CIM-plate only for invasion. Regular growth medium was added in the lower chamber as chemoattractant. The cell index was measured every 15 min, and the results were represented as normalized cell index. For exogenous addition of interleukin-8 (IL-8) (PEPROTECH), 150 ng/ml of IL-8 was added to cells transfected with siATM and 200 ng/ml of IL-8 was added to cells depleted for p53."

Using breast cancer cells, they report that ATM is required for cell migration in a \u2018wound healing\u2019 experimental system, that this function of ATM is independent of its canonical role in the DNA damage response (DDR), acting instead through an alternative ROS-mediated activation pathway. They report that mutant p53 also contributes to cell migration in this system. Gene expression analysis downstream of ATM and mutant p53 reveals that both factors are positive regulators of IL-8 expression in a mechanism likely involving the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. In turn, they demonstrate that IL-8 partially mediates the pro-invasive roles of ATM and mutant p53 in their system. They also show data from mouse xenograft experiments demonstrating a pro-metastatic role for ATM."

Over the past few years it has become apparent that ATM plays other roles outside of its canonical role as the apical kinase in the DDR, and that some of these non-canonical roles may be oncogenic rather than tumor suppressive. Several lines of evidence point to a role for ATM as a sensor of oxidative stress playing roles in mitophagy, ROS control and central metabolism. Within this context, the pathway described here (i.e. ROS&gt;ATM&gt;NF-\u03baB&gt;IL8&gt;invasion/metastasis) is deemed significant. The data are convincing and the connection to lung metastasis in particular is intriguing, especially given the high oxygen burden in lung in particular."

In Singh et al., macrophage conditioned medium was shown to induce cell migration in an ATM-dependent manner in MCF7 cells. MCF7 cells contain wild-type p53, and we now provide new data showing that ATM does not promote IL-8 expression levels in a wild-type p53 background, see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1A-B</a>. In addition, IL8 was not studied in Singh et al. Thus, the pathway described in Singh et al. is likely to be very different in many aspects from our study. Therefore, although one can draw similarities between these studies, we believe our work is clearly novel and complimentary."

These results are consistent with our observation that IL-8 levels are highly reduced under these conditions. Upon DNA damage, ATM is known to phosphorylate p53 on S15 which is involved in promoting its activity. NEMO is also phosphorylated by ATM upon DNA damage which activates the NF-\u03baB pathway. How these pathways operate in cancer cells with high ROS levels is unknown. To further investigate how IL-8 is regulated by these pathways we have performed several additional experiments as suggested by the reviewers. We have found that ATM can phosphorylate p53 on S15 in MDA-MB-231 cells <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1C</a> suggesting that ATM could regulate mutant p53 directly. We have also analyzed the role of NEMO in regulating IL-8. Depletion of NEMO resulted in reduced IL-8 mRNA levels, the same result obtained in siATM or simutantp53 cells. These data demonstrate that NEMO is required for this pathway, data consistent with its established role in activating NF-\u03baB. We have included these new data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>."

Although not definitive given this negative result, our inability to identify mutant p53 bound to the IL-8 promoter suggests that mutant p53 functions within a different context to regulate the promoter activity of IL-8. We also tested whether mutant p53 could interact with NF-\u03baB in MDA-MB-231 cells. co-IP western experiments with mutant p53 or p65 did not detect any physical interaction between these proteins in MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). This suggests that it is perhaps unlikely that mutant p53 interacts with p65 in the cytoplasm to inhibit NF-\u03baB activity. We instead favor a model whereby mutant p53 affects NEMO activation. We have new data showing that depletion of mutant p53 results in reduced NEMO phosphorylation (see 4 below). This suggests that mutant p53 helps promote NEMO activation, which is a known modulator of NF-\u03baB. How gain-of-function p53 mutations alter p53 to promote pro-tumorigenic functions is known to be complex. Our additional experiments have identified the requirement of NEMO in regulating IL-8 and suggest that mutant p53 participates in this pathway. From these lines of evidence, we conclude that mutant p53 does not regulate IL-8 directly by binding to its promoter or through direct interactions with p65. We are excited to follow-up on these results in detailed and extensive future studies to analyze in-depth the molecular mechanisms that govern the crosstalk between ATM, mutant p53 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, especially in regards to promoting cellular migration and invasion in response to oxidative stress."

Similar to WT p53, we observed that IL-8 mRNA levels increased upon siRNA-depletion of ATM in two different human cancer cell lines containing WT p53, U2OS and MCF7, respectively.

We have shown that depletion of mutant p53 results in: 1) reduced IL-8 and IL-8 promoter activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B-D</a>), 2) reduced nuclear p65 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>) and 3) reduced p65 accumulation on the IL-8 promoter by ChIP analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). These results were all obtained also in ATM depleted cells, suggesting that ATM and mutant p53 regulate this NF-\u03baB pathway similarly. In response to the reviewers\u2019 suggestions, we have performed additional experiments to analyze how mutant p53 could regulate NF-\u03baB signaling. We observe that ATM or mutant p53-depleted cells do not reduce expression of NF-\u03baB or NEMO at either the mRNA or protein levels (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2C-F</a>). However, we did observe reduced phosphorylation of NEMO in p53-depleted cells that was similar to the reduction in ATM-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2F</a>). These data, along with our new data showing the reduction of IL-8 mRNA in NEMO-depleted cells, suggest that NF-\u03baB activity is regulated by ATM and mutant p53 through NEMO. Collectively, these data indicate that mutant p53 regulates NF-\u03baB signaling in a similar fashion as ATM. These results are in agreement with ATM and mutant p53 cooperating to regulate NF-\u03baB signaling that results in IL-8 expression."
