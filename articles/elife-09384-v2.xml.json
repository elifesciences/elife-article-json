We discover a macromolecular complex between the scaffolding protein Gravin/AKAP12 and the mitotic kinases, Aurora A and Plk1, that is down regulated in human seminoma. Depletion of Gravin correlates with an increased mitotic index and disorganization of seminiferous tubules. Biochemical, super-resolution imaging, and enzymology approaches establish that this Gravin scaffold accumulates at the mother spindle pole during metaphase. Manipulating elements of the Gravin-Aurora A-Plk1 axis prompts mitotic delay and prevents appropriate assembly of astral microtubules to promote spindle misorientation. These pathological responses are conserved in seminiferous tubules from <i>Gravin</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice where an overabundance of Oct3/4 positive germ line stem cells displays randomized orientation of mitotic spindles. Thus, we propose that Gravin-mediated recruitment of Aurora A and Plk1 to the mother (oldest) spindle pole contributes to the fidelity of symmetric cell division."

We discover a macromolecular complex between the scaffolding protein Gravin/AKAP12 and the mitotic kinases, Aurora A and Plk1, that is down regulated in human seminoma. Depletion of Gravin correlates with an increased mitotic index and disorganization of seminiferous tubules. Biochemical, super-resolution imaging, and enzymology approaches establish that this Gravin scaffold accumulates at the mother spindle pole during metaphase. Manipulating elements of the Gravin-Aurora A-Plk1 axis prompts mitotic delay and prevents appropriate assembly of astral microtubules to promote spindle misorientation. These pathological responses are conserved in seminiferous tubules from <i>Gravin</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice where an overabundance of Oct3/4 positive germ line stem cells displays randomized orientation of mitotic spindles. Thus, we propose that Gravin-mediated recruitment of Aurora A and Plk1 to the mother (oldest) spindle pole contributes to the fidelity of symmetric cell division."

In mice that lack Gravin, the cells in a region of the testicle called the seminiferous tubule divide more rapidly, which is a hallmark of cancer. Gravin accumulates at the end of the spindle where the older centriole is present. This protein acts as a scaffold that holds two enzymes called kinases that regulate cell division in place at the end of the spindle. In the stem cells of the testicle, these kinases also appear to help to correctly position the spindle by organizing the proteins that anchor this end of the spindle to the membrane."

First, immunoblot analysis detected Aurora A and Plk1 in Gravin immune complexes isolated from mitotic cell lysates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, lane 6). Control experiments confirmed that the closely related Aurora B kinase does not interact with Gravin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, lane 4). Conversely, the RII subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) constitutively interacts with Gravin throughout the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, lanes 4 and 6). Second, conventional immunofluorescent techniques demonstrate that Aurora A (red), Plk1 (green), and p766-Gravin (blue) are concentrated at mitotic spindle poles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Control experiments confirmed that total Gravin (red) organizes at mitotic spindle poles with a subpopulation dispersed throughout the cell (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), whereas Aurora B localizes to the metaphase plate (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Third, structured illumination microscopy (SIM, resolution \u223c100 nm) revealed that p-Gravin, Aurora A, and Plk1 decorated a higher-order lattice-like structure at mitotic spindle poles reminiscent of pericentriolar material (PCM (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lawo et al., 2012</a>); <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Lastly, a proximity ligation assay (PLA) was used to pinpoint p766-Gravin association with either kinase during the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013H</a>). This approach combines antibody recognition with amplification of a DNA hetero-duplex to mark discrete protein\u2013protein interaction pairs that reside within 40\u201360 nm of each other (<a href=\"#bib46\">Samelson et al., 2015</a>). Quantification of PLA puncta indicated that p766-Gravin/Aurora A sub-complexes was enhanced 3.86-fold during metaphase when compared to interphase cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). The p766-Gravin-Plk1 sub-complex was enriched 10.34-fold (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). Thus, we conclude that p766-Gravin scaffolds Aurora A with Plk1 at a PCM-like structure on mitotic spindle poles during metaphase."

Surprisingly, the location of Plk1 changed upon shRNA-mediated gene silencing of Gravin (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). Plk1 now predominated at the daughter spindle pole (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). This unexpected finding demonstrates that Gravin governs the preferential recruitment of Aurora A and Plk1 to mother spindle poles, one of their appropriate sites of action during mitosis. Additional control experiments in HEK293 cells revealed that cellular levels of both kinases were unaltered in absence of Gravin (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). This latter observation argues that ablation of Gravin in tissue culture cell lines instigates the displacement of both kinases from the spindle pole but may not affect the cellular levels of each enzyme. However, on the basis of our analysis of clinical samples in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, we propose that unidentified mitigating factors contribute to the mislocalization and depletion of both kinases in human tissue."

In order to test this hypothesis, we evaluated astral microtubule abundance, length, and ultrastructure at super-resolution using SIM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013I</a>). Pericentrin served as a universal spindle pole marker (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). Centrobin staining was selectively detected daughter spindle poles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1J</a>). In wild-type MEFs, we observed protrusion of astral microtubules from both spindle poles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). However, upon quantification of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed SIM images, it was evident that astral microtubules protruding from the mother spindle pool were longer than those emanating from the daughter spindle pole (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Next, we investigated this process in Gravin null MEFs to ascertain whether the anchoring protein or its binding partners influence this phenomenon. Notably in Gravin null MEFs, the length of astral microtubules protruding from the mother spindle pool was reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Therefore, on the basis of these findings, we can propose that Gravin or elements of its signaling scaffold contribute to the assembly of astral microtubules. Additional rescue experiments with a Gravin mutant (T766A) that is unable to interact with Plk1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Canton et al., 2012</a>) were achieved at a low frequency but did not restore robust protrusion of astral microtubules (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1K</a>). Nonetheless, we contend that Gravin-mediated anchoring of Plk1 to the mother spindle pole contributes to the assembly or maintenance of astral microtubules."

Incubation with VX-680 reduced Kemptide phosphorylation by 33.5% (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, n = 3).

Third, phospho-peptide antibodies served as an independent index to detect active Aurora A (p-288) and active Plk1 (p-210). Both active kinases were prominent in mitotic lysates from cells treated with control shRNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, lane 3).

The active kinases were absent from lysates prepared from interphase cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, lanes 1 and 2).

As a prelude to these studies, it was necessary to generate reagents that displace Aurora A and Plk1 from Gravin. In vitro binding studies using purified GST-Gravin fragments mapped a central region of the anchoring protein (amino acids 451 to 900) that directly interacts with Aurora A (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> top panel, lane 4). More detailed mapping studies defined at least two extended Aurora A-binding sequences within this region, thus eliminating site-directed mutagenesis as the most direct approach to disrupt the Aurora A-Gravin interaction. As an alternate approach, we employed ectopic expression of a Gravin fragment as the primary means of displacing Aurora A from the scaffold. Mutation of Thr766 to Ala in the context of the Gravin 451-900 fragment (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) created a cell-based \u2018Aurora A disruptor\u2019 that antagonizes Aurora A anchoring (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) without impacting Plk1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Canton et al., 2012</a>).

Metaphase was delayed in Gravin shRNA depleted cells (78.04 \u00b1 3.06 min, n = 29) compared to control (45.86 \u00b1 1.27 min, n = 28, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>).

Experiments with a Gravin\u0394PKA mutant that cannot anchor PKA (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nauert et al., 1997</a>) restored normal cell cycle progression, thereby excluding a role for Gravin-associated-PKA in this process (55.69 \u00b1 3.41 min, n = 29; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F,I</a>).

                                "text": "The orientation of the mitotic spindle during cell division determines whether a polarized epithelium will expand symmetrically (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gillies and Cabernard, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Williams et al., 2014</a>). Orientation is influenced by the distribution of molecular components at mitotic spindle poles (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yamashita et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lesage et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Januschke et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, we reasoned that manipulation of the Gravin scaffold could affect spindle orientation during cell division. To test this hypothesis, we used a spindle tilt assay to measure the angle of each mitotic spindle relative to the substratum ((<a href=\"#bib12\">Delaval et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hehnly and Doxsey, 2014</a>) <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Ectopic expression of the Aurora A disruptor perturbed spindle orientation. Mislocalization of Aurora A promoted a 20\u00b0 misalignment of the mitotic spindle when compared to control cells transfected with empty vector (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Most control spindles were parallel to the substratum (averaging around 5\u201310\u00b0; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). Yet in Gravin-depleted cells, the perturbation of spindle orientation was 40\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). Notably, these more severe spindle angle defects were rescued upon expression of the mouse Gravin ortholog (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). In contrast, spindle angle defects were only partially rescued upon expression of the Plk1-binding defective Gravin T766A mutant (angles averaging around 20\u00b0; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). The magnitude of this partial rescue is reminiscent of the results obtained upon mislocalization of Aurora A (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Further support was provided upon analysis of 3D reconstructed images collected from wild-type and Gravin null MEFs. In wild-type MEFs, the alignment of the mitotic spindle was parallel to the substratum as assessed by the positioning of the spindle poles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, left). In contrast, abnormal orientation and positioning of mitotic spindles were observed in Gravin null MEFs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, right). Thus, we propose that Gravin, through its interaction with Aurora A and Plk1, ensures correct spindle orientation during mitosis."

Initially, we examined the morphology of tissue sections from wild-type and Gravin knockout mice. Seminiferous tubules are organized into ascending cellular layers with germ line stem cells (spermatogonia, magenta) residing on the inner face of the basement membrane (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Appropriate cellular layering was observed in wild-type sections stained for Gravin (green) and nuclei (white) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, left). Parallel sections stained for acetylated tubulin established the correct lumenal organization of elongating spermatids (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, left). In contrast, the cellular layering of seminiferous tubules and lumenal organization of spermatids are disrupted in Gravin knockout mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>; right). Of note, the diameter of the lumen is significantly decreased in seminiferous tubules from Gravin knockout mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). In addition, the elongating spermatids are haphazardly dispersed throughout the lumen (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, right).

Self-renewing, parallel stem cell division produces two daughter stem cells, whereas perpendicular stem cell division yields one differentiating daughter cell and one stem cell ([<a href=\"#bib48\">Siller and Doe, 2009</a>] <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Basement membrane sections of the seminiferous tubules were identified with the stem cell marker Oct3/4 to investigate the angle of spindle orientation in germ line stem cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>, magenta). Mitotic spindle orientation was established by counterstaining with tubulin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>, green). Indeed, two populations of dividing stem cells were observed: those with a mitotic spindle perpendicular (\u223c90\u00b0) to the basement membrane and those with a mitotic spindle parallel (\u223c10\u00b0) to the basement membrane (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Staining for p766-Gravin (green) and DNA (blue) confirmed that the phosphorylated anchoring protein was present in the few cells undergoing mitosis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>, top and lower left panels). In contrast, mitotic cells from Gravin knockout mice displayed a randomized mitotic spindle orientation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>, lower right panel). Importantly, this increased incidence of spindle angle randomization was evident in mitotic Gravin knockout germ line stem cells (average angle of 47.67\u00b0, n = 98; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>). These findings indicate that interrupting spindle polarity may adversely affect the development within seminiferous tubules in Gravin knockout mice."

Therefore, we established the subcellular distribution of this kinase in seminiferous tubule sections from wild-type and Gravin knockout mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I\u2013L</a>). Acetylated tubulin was used as a marker for mitotic spindle poles (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I</a>, left panels; red). In wild-type sections, the Plk1 signal was prominent at mitotic spindle poles (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I</a>, top mid panel; green). Conversely, in Gravin knockout sections, the Plk1 signal was more disperse (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I</a>, lower mid panel; green). Examination of representative cells from both genotypes at higher magnification best illustrates this phenomenon (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8J</a>). Line scan analysis detected an asymmetric distribution of Plk1 at one spindle pole in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8K</a>, top panel). Conversely, a more uniform distribution of this kinase was detected in Gravin knockout cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8K</a>, lower panel). Quantitative analysis of multiple cells confirmed these findings further suggesting that Gravin functions to preferentially anchor Plk1 at one spindle pole in vivo (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8L</a>).

Existing stem cell populations that undergo misoriented division may expand exponentially. Alternatively, germ line stem cells may prematurely differentiate thereby diminishing the total stem cell population.

A 3.82-fold increase in Oct3/4-positive cells was observed in Gravin knockout sections (n = 4; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8M,N</a>). Thus, randomized spindle angles and the concomitant over-proliferation of germ line stem cells may underlie the pathological abnormalities observed in Gravin knockout seminiferous tubule organization as well as human seminoma (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 8</a>)."

We have discovered an additional role for both kinases in the establishment of spindle orientation during mitotic progression. A key element of our finding is that both active kinases must be associated with the scaffolding protein Gravin to fulfill this ancillary function. By combining biochemical approaches (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) with quantitative super-resolution imaging and enzymology (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3, 4</a>), we have uncovered a unique kinase complex that assembles at the mother spindle pole during metaphase. Formation of a Gravin-Aurora A-Plk1 scaffold at this location may facilitate signal relay as depicted in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> to drive the spatial and temporal phosphorylation pattern of as yet unknown mitotic substrates."

Surprisingly, we observed an asymmetric distribution of the Gravin kinase scaffold at the mother spindle pole (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Clustering of these enzymes at this location can either catalyze the efficient assembly of the PCM or alternatively coordinate the assembly of astral microtubules that orient the mitotic spindle. The super-resolution imaging analysis of Gravin null MEFs in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> argues strongly for the latter as these cells are deficient in astral microtubules but contain equal amounts of a canonical PCM protein, pericentrin ((<a href=\"#bib13\">Doxsey et al., 1994</a>); <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,G</a>). This notion is also consistent with the anomalous spindle tilt angles that were measured in cultured cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). These observations were further validated in vivo upon analysis of murine seminiferous tubule sections lacking Gravin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

We offer four lines of inquiry to support this new mechanism. First, data presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a> indicate that loss of Gravin impacts the protrusion of astral microtubules. Second, data presented in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> show that symmetric cell division is lost in Gravin null MEFs. Third, we measure increased mitotic spindle angles (&gt;20\u00b0) in Gravin shRNA-treated cells compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013E</a>). Fourth, a logical and important mechanistic extension of this latter observation is our finding that astral microtubules are lost from the mother spindle poles in Gravin null MEFs. Moreover, we postulate that the sequestering these enzymes at the mother spindle pole ensures that each kinase is optimally positioned to play a role in the regulation of astral microtubule protrusion, a process that influences the correct orientation of mitotic spindles during cell division. This mechanism is compatible with two recent reports indicating that signaling events downstream Plk1 modulate the correct orientation mitotic spindles (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hanafusa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yan et al., 2015</a>). However, a vital new piece of this puzzle, uncovered solely from our work, is that Gravin functions as the anchor for these enzymes."

These events influence cell fate determination and tissue organization (<a href=\"#bib48\">Siller and Doe, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gillies and Cabernard, 2011</a>). In keeping with this notion, Gravin knockout mice exhibit an increase in Oct3/4, a marker for stem cells within the seminiferous tubule (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8M,N</a>). This is evocative of clinical studies that detect a marked increase in Oct3/4-positive cells in solid-state tumors including seminoma (<a href=\"#bib49\">Singh et al., 2011</a>). These clinical results are entirely consistent with the data presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> depicting a loss in tissue morphology observed in tissue sections from seminoma patients (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). At the molecular level, we also detect decreased Gravin, Aurora A, and Plk1 levels in several samples collected from seminoma patients (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Therefore, we postulate that abnormalities in Gravin expression that promote mislocalization of Aurora A and Plk1 contributes to defects in orientation of mitotic spindles to potentiate seminoma progression. However, Gravin knockout mice do not develop seminomas, yet some of the aforementioned abnormalities are evident in these animals. For example, these animals have difficultly breeding and upon aging display a tendency to develop prostate hyperplasia (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akakura et al., 2008</a>). Both of these phenotypes may be indicative of developmental defects in polarized cell division. Therefore, we speculate that perturbation of Gravin-mediated signaling events during mitosis may promote a chronic decrease in organization of the seminiferous tubules with concomitant impairment of reproductive viability. Finally, when the mouse studies are considered in the context of our biochemical analysis and imaging of clinical samples, we can conclude that Gravin constrains Aurora A and Plk1 in an asymmetric manner to control spindle orientation during mitosis. Thus, we identify and define a new macromolecular signaling scaffold that drives stem cell maintenance and cell differentiation in seminiferous tubules."

Two separate cameras were used depending on whether it was live-cell acquisition (Hamamatsu ImagEM EM-CCD Camera C9100-13) or fixed samples (CoolSnap HQ camera, Photometrics). Z-stacks were shown as 2D maximum projections or processed for 3-dimensional rendering (Metamorph). Fluorescence range intensity was adjusted identically for each series of panels. Intensity profiles and fluorescence intensity quantification were obtained from sum projections of Z stacks using either Metamorph or ImageJ/Fiji software. Fluorescence intensity quantification of spindle poles was carried out as previously described (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hehnly and Doxsey, 2014</a>). In short, computer-generated concentric circles of 60 (inner area) or 80 (outer area) pixels in diameter were used to measure spindle pole (inner area) and calculate local background (difference between the outer and inner area) fluorescence intensity. Spindle angle measurements were carried out as previously described (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hehnly and Doxsey, 2014</a>)."

Briefly, spindle angle was estimated using inverse trigonometric functions, specifically, arctan (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kuo et al., 2011</a>). Thus, if two spindle poles are in focus at the same z-plane, the estimated spindle orientation would be 0\u00b0.

For asymmetric divisions in the seminiferous tubules of the testis, a total of 5\u201310 tissue sections were analyzed per mouse.

The data presented are interesting and the manuscript is well organized. However, the mechanisms by which Gravin scaffold accumulation at the mother spindle pole ensures proper spindle orientation in germline stem cells remain unclear."

Second, if Gravin is required for symmetric cell division, the authors need to propose a mechanistic model by which Gravin-mediated asymmetric accumulation of Aurora A and Plk1 at the mother spindle pole contributes to a parallel-symmetric division.
