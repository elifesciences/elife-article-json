In order to dissect the gene network that is translationally regulated by SRSF1, we performed a high-throughput deep sequencing analysis of polysomal fractions in cells overexpressing SRSF1. We identified approximately 1500 mRNAs that are translational targets of SRSF1. These include mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as spindle, kinetochore, and M phase proteins, which are essential for accurate chromosome segregation. Indeed, we show that translational activity of SRSF1 is required for normal mitotic progression. Furthermore, we found that mRNAs that display alternative splicing changes upon SRSF1 overexpression are also its translational targets, strongly suggesting that SRSF1 couples pre-mRNA splicing and translation. These data provide insights on the complex role of SRSF1 in the control of gene expression at multiple levels and its implications in cancer."

In order to dissect the gene network that is translationally regulated by SRSF1, we performed a high-throughput deep sequencing analysis of polysomal fractions in cells overexpressing SRSF1. We identified approximately 1500 mRNAs that are translational targets of SRSF1. These include mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as spindle, kinetochore, and M phase proteins, which are essential for accurate chromosome segregation. Indeed, we show that translational activity of SRSF1 is required for normal mitotic progression. Furthermore, we found that mRNAs that display alternative splicing changes upon SRSF1 overexpression are also its translational targets, strongly suggesting that SRSF1 couples pre-mRNA splicing and translation. These data provide insights on the complex role of SRSF1 in the control of gene expression at multiple levels and its implications in cancer."

They have a modular structure consisting of one or two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which determine their RNA-binding specificity and a C-terminal domain rich in arginine and serine residues (RS domain) (<a href=\"#bib96\">Shepard and Hertel, 2009</a>). An extended family of RS domain-containing proteins present in metazoans, termed SR-like or SR-related proteins, are structurally and functionally distinct from canonical SR proteins and have roles not exclusively related to splicing but participate in other cellular functions as well, including transcription and cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#bib17\">Boucher et al., 2001</a>). The activity of SR proteins in alternative splicing is defined by the location of their binding sites, generally displaying a stimulatory role in splicing when bound to exons and an inhibitory role when bound to introns (<a href=\"#bib43\">Han et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Erkelenz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib118\">Zhou and Fu, 2013</a>). Their function in alternative splicing can be antagonized by the activity of hnRNP A/B proteins in a concentration-dependent manner, in such a way that the relative ratios of these antagonists can influence patterns of regulated splicing in a tissue-specific or developmentally regulated manner (<a href=\"#bib33\">Eperon et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib119\">Zhu et al., 2001</a>). Although initially the RS domain was proposed to solely act as a protein\u2013protein interaction domain, it was later revealed that it also acts to contact the pre-mRNA (<a href=\"#bib93\">Shen and Green, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Shen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Hertel and Graveley, 2005</a>).

The SR protein SRSF3 (previously known as SRp20) antagonizes the function of the reported hnRNP proteins in PK-M alternative splicing (<a href=\"#bib112\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). The antagonistic activities of SRSF1 and hnRNP A1 also control the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reversal (MET) through production of two different alternatively spliced isoforms of the Ron proto-oncogene (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ghigna et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Bonomi et al., 2013</a>). The levels of SRSF1 are regulated during EMT/MET via alternative splicing associated with the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (AS-NMD), which is regulated by the splicing factor Sam68 (<a href=\"#bib110\">Valacca et al., 2010</a>). SRSF1 has been identified as an oncogenic protein with altered expression in several tumors (<a href=\"#bib55\">Karni et al., 2007</a>). Its increased expression leads, in cooperation with MYC, to the transformation of mammary epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anczuk\u00f3w et al., 2012</a>). SRSF3 has also been proposed to be a proto-oncogene critical for cell proliferation and tumor induction and maintenance (<a href=\"#bib53\">Jia et al., 2010</a>), whereas SRSF6 (SRp55) is amplified and is an oncoprotein in lung and colon cancers (<a href=\"#bib24\">Cohen-Eliav et al., 2013</a>). Recently, a cellular defense mechanism to deal with the oncogenic potential of increased SRSF1 expression has been described, whereby SRSF1 stabilizes the tumor suppressor protein p53 by blocking its MDM2-dependent proteasomal degradation, which ultimately leads to oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Fregoso et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, other splicing factors, such as hnRNP A2/B1, are also overexpressed in some types of cancers, such as glioblastomas, where they are correlated with poor prognosis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Golan-Gerstl et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "A subset of the SR protein family members shuttle from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, including SRSF1 (SF2/ASF), SRSF3 (SRp20), SRSF4 (SRp75), SRSF6 (SRp55), SRSF7 (9G8), and SRSF10 (SRp38) (<a href=\"#bib20\">C\u00e1ceres et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Cowper et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Cazalla et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Sapra et al., 2009</a>). Importantly, shuttling SR proteins have been shown to participate in a wide range of post-splicing activities, including mRNA nuclear export, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and mRNA translation (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib68\">Long and Caceres, 2009</a> and <a href=\"#bib109\">Twyffels et al., 2011</a>). As an example, several studies have revealed that three shuttling SR proteins, SRSF1, SRSF3, and SRSF7, can act as mRNA export adaptors via their interaction with the cellular export factor TAP (<a href=\"#bib52\">Huang and Steitz, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Huang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Hargous et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, increased concentration of SRSF1 promotes nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) (<a href=\"#bib117\">Zhang and Krainer, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Sato et al., 2008</a>). A number of SR protein family members were found to have a role in translation. We have previously shown that hypophosphorylated SRSF1 protein is associated with polyribosomes in cytoplasmic extracts and enhances translation in HeLa cells both in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib87\">Sanford et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib86\">2005</a>). Furthermore, we also uncovered the molecular mechanism by which SRSF1 promotes translation by showing that it promotes translation initiation of bound mRNAs by suppressing the activity of 4E-BP, a competitive inhibitor of cap-dependent translation. This activity is mediated by interactions of SRSF1 with components of the mTOR signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib77\">Michlewski et al., 2008</a>). In agreement with this, it was also shown that SRSF1 activates the mTORC1 branch of the pathway, as measured by S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Karni et al., 2008</a>). These findings suggest a model whereby SRSF1 acts as an adaptor protein that recruits the signaling molecules responsible for regulation of cap-dependent translation of specific mRNAs. Another shuttling SR protein, SRSF7, has also been shown to promote translation of unspliced MMPV retroviral transcripts (<a href=\"#bib106\">Swartz et al., 2007</a>), whereas SRSF5 and SRFS6 increase the rate of Gag translation in the HIV virus (<a href=\"#bib105\">Swanson et al., 2010</a>). SRSF3 functions as a trans-acting factor for the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation of poliovirus, which requires its cytoplasmic relocalization during viral infection (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bedard et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Fitzgerald and Semler, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2013</a>). Despite the presence of growing evidence for a role for shuttling SR proteins in the regulation of mRNA translation, only very few physiological targets have been identified. This raises the issue whether this activity of SR proteins has an important role in gene expression and/or whether it is associated with a particular cellular pathway."

We carried out high-throughput deep sequencing analysis of polysomal fractions in mammalian cells overexpressing SRSF1. This resulted in the identification of a large number of mRNAs that are translationally regulated by SRSF1. These mRNAs encode proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as spindle, kinetochore, and M phase proteins, which are essential for accurate chromosome segregation. Interestingly, we also observed that in many cases SRSF1 affects the alternative splicing of a subset of mRNAs and also influences translation of these isoforms, suggesting a role for SRSF1 in the coupling of pre-mRNA splicing and translation. Altogether, the finding that SRSF1 promotes the increased translation of genes associated with cell division could partially explain the oncogenic role of SRSF1. In summary, these data provide insights on the complex role of SRSF1 in the control of gene expression and its implications in cancer."

Maintaining proper levels of SRSF1 could be critical for cell function. As such, SRSF1 expression is subjected to negative autoregulation in order to maintain homeostatic levels, which involves multiple layers of post-transcriptional and translational control (<a href=\"#bib104\">Sun et al., 2010</a>). Thus, in order to avoid cellular mechanisms that could limit an increased SRSF1 expression, we relied on transient overexpression of an epitope-tagged SR protein cDNA encoding wild-type SRSF1 protein. We used two different concentrations of the SRSF1 expression vector and obtained a maximum of a threefold increase in the levels of transfected SRSF1 protein over endogenous protein in HEK 293T cells that displayed approximately 80\u201390% transfection efficiency (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We chose the highest concentration of transfected SRSF1 protein since this resulted in maximum activation of a luciferase reporter harboring an SRSF1 binding site (<a href=\"#bib87\">Sanford et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, left panel). The translational activation of the luciferase reporter induced by SRSF1 correlated well with a threefold increase in the polysomal/subpolysomal ratio of the reporter RNA (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, right panel). The expression of SRSF1 varies widely in a tissue-specific manner and differences of up to 20-fold between different tissues have been reported (<a href=\"#bib116\">Zahler et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Hanamura et al., 1998</a>). Thus, this level of overexpression is within physiological levels and correlates well with the maximum activation of a translational reporter (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>). We proceeded to fractionate cell cytoplasm across 10\u201345% sucrose gradients and isolated RNA from the subpolysomal and heavy polysomal fractions from control cells and from cells transiently overexpressing SRSF1."

                                "text": "Next, we identified by high-throughput sequencing analysis those mRNAs that shifted to the polysomal fractions upon SRSF1 increased expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). It has been shown that calculating mRNA translation levels as log ratios of actively translated mRNAs divided by the corresponding cytoplasmic mRNA results in a significant number of false positives and false negatives (<a href=\"#bib63\">Larsson et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, to precisely identify those mRNAs whose translation is responsive to increased levels of SRSF1, we used for normalization the log ratios of polysomal mRNAs versus RNAs in subpolysomal plus polysomal fractions. The resulting polysome index measures the proportion/density of each transcript that is present in the polysomal fractions. We compared empty vector-transfected to SRSF1-transfected cells by calculating the distribution of the log<sub>2</sub> ratios of their respective polysome index, which we defined as the polysome shift ratio (PSR) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This allowed for the scoring of an increase in translational efficiency independently of the cellular abundance of the corresponding transcript. A cut off of 0.889 (p&lt;0.01), corresponding to a 1.85-fold increase in the proportion of polysomal-associated transcripts, resulted in the identification of 1576 mRNAs that shifted to heavier polysomal fractions upon SRSF1 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and data in Supplementary file 1 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib76\">Maslon et al. (2014)</a>). Gene Ontology analyses showed that a large proportion of those mRNAs identified in the polysomal shift analysis encode for proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, mitosis, transcription, and post-translational protein modification (based on analysis with DAVID [<a href=\"#bib29\">Dennis et al., 2003</a>]) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Among the RNA targets that displayed a polysomal shift are mRNAs encoding proteins related to cancer, such as NRAS, the Ras-related protein R-Ras2, and those related to cell cycle, such as CDC27, the retinoblastoma binding protein RBBP8, and retinoblastoma-like 1 (RBL1). (A list of all SRSF1 translational targets is provided in Supplementary file 1 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib76\">Maslon et al. (2014)</a>.) The SRSF1 translational targets may represent indirect as well as direct events. In the first scenario, increased expression of SRSF1 could lead to general changes in gene expression, which could result indirectly in the translational upregulation of a subset of mRNAs. Conversely, direct events would represent events whereby SRSF1 binds to its mRNA targets and activates their translation. Interestingly, we observed that 41% of all mRNAs identified in the polysomal shift experiment upon SRSF1 overexpression were previously identified as bona fide RNA targets of this SR protein by CLIP-seq (<a href=\"#bib88\">Sanford et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This strongly suggests that these are direct mRNA translational targets of SRSF1. We combined k-mer enrichment analysis (the enrichment of every 5-mer within the RNA sequences) with motif discovery to search for over-represented sequences in SRSF1 mRNA translational targets. MEME was used to retrieve a motif logo from mRNA regions containing the over-represented 5-mers (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">1995</a>). This resulted in the identification of a purine-rich motif very similar to the one obtained when identifying genome-wide targets of SRSF1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib85\">Sanford et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib88\">2009</a>). Interestingly, the frequency of this motif showed a clear gradient, being more predominant in CLIP-positive translational targets than in CLIP-negative translational targets and was even more reduced in both the CLIP-positive and CLIP-negative subset of mRNAs that did not shift to polysomes following SRSF1 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In fact, statistical analysis showed a significant enrichment of the CLIP-positive mRNAs containing the identified consensus motif (CM) in the SRSF1 translational targets (Fisher\u2019s exact test: OR 1.686, p&lt;2.2E-16) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We further refer to these 505 mRNAs as SRSF1 direct translational targets. Next we analyzed whether there was any position bias with respect to the SRSF1 consensus motif in SRSF1 translational targets. We observed that this motif is preferentially located in the coding DNA sequence (CDS) and to a lesser extent in the 5\u2032UTR of SRSF1 translational targets, when compared with those mRNAs whose translation is unaffected by increased SRSF1 expression (referred to as null [PSR\u223c0]) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Gene Ontology analysis of direct SRSF1 translational targets revealed an enrichment in mRNAs associated with cell cycle and chromosome organization, as previously seen when analyzing all targets or CLIP-positive targets (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,C</a>) as well as an enrichment in mRNAs linked with transcription and RNA metabolism (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

                                "text": "We sought to further explore a role for SRSF1 in mediating the translational regulation of proteins involved in different aspects of RNA metabolism, such as splicing, NMD, and translation. As a control we included a chimeric SRSF1 protein harboring a nuclear retention signal (NRS), identified in the non-shuttling protein SRSF2, which was fused at its C-terminus. This protein, termed SRSF1-NRS, is constitutively retained in the nucleus and does not activate translation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Cazalla et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Sanford et al., 2004</a>). In most cases, we confirmed that overexpression of SRSF1 protein, but not of the nuclear-retained SRSF1-NRS variant, results in a shift of the mRNAs encoding for the aforementioned proteins to polysomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). For instance, we noticed that overexpression of SRSF1 results in increased translation of CWC22, an essential splicing factor that also has a role in exon junction complex deposition and NMD (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexandrov et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Barbosa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Steckelberg et al., 2012</a>), as well as of PRPF18 that is required for the second step of pre-mRNA splicing (<a href=\"#bib48\">Horowitz and Krainer, 1997</a>). SRSF1 translational targets that were validated in this assay also include LSM3, which is a constituent of the Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex that functions in the 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 mRNA decay pathway (<a href=\"#bib92\">Sharif and Conti, 2013</a>), as well as proteins involved in the NMD pathway such as UPF2 and PNRC2 (data in Supplementary file 1 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib76\">Maslon et al. (2014)</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib80\">Nicholson et al., 2010</a>). In particular, PNRC2 shows a drastic movement to polysomal fractions upon SRSF1 overexpression, but is not responsive to increased expression of the SRSF1-NRS variant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Together, these observations are consistent with a role for SRSF1 in regulating the translation of mRNAs encoding components of the RNA processing pathway. Of interest, we noticed that SRSF1 also promotes the translation of mRNAs encoding negative regulators of mRNA translation, such as EIF4E3 that recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine-containing mRNA cap during an early step in translation initiation (<a href=\"#bib81\">Osborne et al., 2013</a>), as well as Paip2 that inhibits translation both in vitro and in vivo by displacing PABP from the poly(A) tail (<a href=\"#bib58\">Khaleghpour et al., 2001</a>). This could represent a feedback mechanism that becomes activated in response to SRSF1 overexpression to antagonize its role in translation. Alternatively it could suggest a role for SRSF1 in the negative regulation of translation of subsets of mRNAs that are targets of EIF4E3 and/or PAIP2. Indeed, we observed that 165 mRNAs are translationally repressed by increased expression of SRSF1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Thus, we sought to determine whether the SRSF1-induced polysomal shift of target mRNAs correlated with higher protein abundance. Use of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) resulted in the identification of 2157 proteins in the three protein lysates used (untransfected, empty vector, and SRSF1-transfected HEK 293T cells) (data in Supplementary file 2 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib76\">Maslon et al. (2014)</a>). Following normalization, we calculated for each of those proteins the log<sub>2</sub> of the ratio between the levels of each individual protein in cells overexpressing SRSF1 versus control cells (SILAC index). Thus, a positive value of the SILAC index indicates an increase in protein abundance upon SRSF1 overexpression. As expected, we found the higher score for SRSF1 (data in Supplementary file 2 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib76\">Maslon et al. (2014)</a>). To establish a correlation with the PSR, the SILAC index for each protein was assigned to the mRNAs encoded by the corresponding gene (data in Supplementary files 1 and 2 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib76\">Maslon et al. (2014)</a>). We found a positive correlation showing increased protein levels for SRSF1 direct translational targets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, third box).

This activity is mediated by interactions of SRSF1 with components of the mTOR signaling pathway. This suggested a model whereby SRSF1 functions as an adaptor to recruit signaling molecules responsible for regulation of cap-dependent translation of specific mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib77\">Michlewski et al., 2008</a>). We sought to determine whether endogenous SRSF1 translational targets responded to the same mechanism of translational activation, as we previously showed using reporter assays. For this, we treated cells transiently expressing SRSF1 (or control cells) with a specific inhibitor of the mTOR kinase, PP242 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Dowling et al., 2010</a>), and then measured polysomal to subpolysomal ratios of a subset of selected SRSF1 translational targets, including proteins related to RNA processing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Interestingly, we found that inhibition of mTOR abrogated the stimulatory activity of SRSF1 on the translation of selected targets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This demonstrates that the activity of SRSF1 in translational activation of endogenous targets requires the mTOR pathway."

Indeed, we previously showed by coupling CLIP with subcellular fractionation that mRNAs found associated with SRSF1 in the nucleus, were also found in the cytoplasm and in the actively translating pool of ribosomes, suggesting that splicing and translation of those mRNAs could be coordinated by SRSF1 (<a href=\"#bib85\">Sanford et al., 2008</a>). To assess a global effect of SRSF1 in coupling of pre-mRNA splicing with mRNA translation, we analyzed changes in alternative splicing in cells overexpressing SRSF1 using exon-junction arrays. We identified 382 differentially regulated cassette exons: 209 events associated with skipping of an alternative exon and 173 events where overexpression of SRSF1 resulted in the inclusion of an alternative exon (data in Supplementary file 3 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib76\">Maslon et al. (2014)</a>). In order to correlate the polysomal shift of SRSF1 translational targets with the alternative splicing of those mRNAs, the PSR for the isoforms generated by the changes in alternative splicing events upon SRSF1 overexpression were analyzed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Interestingly, we observed a statistically significant increase in the PSR of the isoforms generated by skipping as well as inclusion of a cassette exon (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This suggests that SRSF1 can influence both the alternative splicing as well as the translational efficiency of subsets of mRNAs. As an example, we focused on the alternative splicing of the SR protein kinase Clk1 pre-mRNA, which is regulated through alternative splicing, giving rise to two isoforms encoding catalytically active and truncated inactive polypeptides (Clk1Ex4+ and Clk1Ex4\u2212, respectively) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Duncan et al., 1997</a>). Indeed, we could confirm that SRSF1 overexpression caused increased inclusion of the alternatively spliced exon 4 of CLK1 mRNA, giving rise to the active Clk1 isoform (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, left panel). Furthermore, an SRSF1 CLIP tag containing a consensus motif mapped to this cassette exon suggesting that it is bound directly by SRSF1 (data in Supplementary file 3 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib76\">Maslon et al. (2014)</a>). Interestingly, this isoform was also more translated (as measured by polysome to subpolysome ratio by RT-qPCR) upon SRSF1 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, right panel)."

                                "text": "A large number of SRSF1 mRNA translational targets encode for proteins involved in cell cycle regulation (data in Supplementary file 1 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib76\">Maslon et al. (2014)</a>). This is even more apparent when looking at the functional classification of direct translation targets containing the SRSF1 consensus binding motif (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>) that includes several redundant layers such as cell cycle (p = 3.35E-06), chromosome organization (p = 2.79E-07), and M phase (p = 3.61E-05), suggesting that SRSF1-mediated translation may affect proper mitotic progression. In particular, many of these mRNAs encode for proteins with a role in mitotic spindle and kinetochore formation (data in Supplementary file 1 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib76\">Maslon et al. (2014)</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The aforementioned group of proteins comprises, among others, a group of centrosomal proteins including CEP170, CEP70, and CEP57, proteins involved in kinetochore and spindle function, such as NDC80 and CCDC99, and proteins forming the condensin complex, including SMC2 and SMC4. NDC80, a core protein of the NDC80 complex, is required for stable microtubule binding in the outer plate of kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib113\">Wei et al., 2007</a>), whereas CCDC99, also known as Spindly, is required for the dynein/dynactin localization to kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib9\">Barisic et al., 2010</a>). Centrosomal proteins control cell cycle progression and spindle\u2013kinetochore assembly (<a href=\"#bib62\">Kumar et al., 2013</a>). In particular, CEP57 is involved in linking central spindle microtubules and is required for spindle integrity (<a href=\"#bib46\">He et al., 2013</a>), CEP70 is necessary for the organization and orientation of a bipolar spindle in mitosis, and CEP170 is involved in microtubule organization and associates with spindle microtubules during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib97\">Shi et al., 2011</a>). Finally, SMC2 and SMC4 proteins are part of the condensin I and II complexes, which, together with cohesin, restructure chromosomes to promote faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib70\">Losada and Hirano, 2005</a>). Importantly, altered translational regulation of any of these proteins could have important implications for faithful chromosome segregation, as this depends on the formation of a bipolar spindle and the correct attachment of kinetochores to spindle microtubules. Notably, another identified SRSF1 translational target, CDK1, has also been shown to regulate the assembly of mitotic spindles as well as spindle positioning, stability, and elongation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Enserink and Kolodner, 2010</a>)."

We estimated their polysome to subpolysome ratio in HEK 293T cells overexpressing SRSF1 using RT-qPCR. We observed a shift to the polysomal fraction upon increased SRSF1 expression (note that both concentrations shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> were used here). By contrast, increased expression of the translationally inactive SRSF1-NRS variant did not cause a shift to the polysomal fraction in most cases. Also, as expected we observed a decrease in polysomal association of these mRNAs upon siRNA-mediated depletion of SRSF1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This analysis validated this subset of mRNAs as bona fide translational targets, suggesting a role for SRSF1 in the translational regulation of proteins that are required for cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We also performed Western blotting analysis of some of these targets and were able to confirm that SRSF1 overexpression results in increased levels of CEP70, NDC80, and SMC4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Conversely, we observed decreased protein levels following SRSF1 depletion, in particular of NDC80, SMC4, and CEP57 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Furthermore, SILAC analysis also showed that increased expression of SRSF1 resulted in increased levels of proteins related to cell cycle progression and chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and data in Supplementary file 2 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib76\">Maslon et al. (2014)</a>). In particular, CEP170, CBX3, and PDS5B protein abundance increased in response to SRSF1 overexpression, further validating the role of SRSF1 in regulating translation of these targets. In agreement with these observations, previous findings from the MitoCheck consortium have revealed that SRSF1 is involved in mitotic progression (<a href=\"#bib79\">Neumann et al., 2010</a>)."

Since our studies were carried out for the most part in asynchronous cell populations, it remains possible that SRSF1 non-translational effects on cell cycle could be the cause of at least some of the observed changes in mRNA translation. Importantly, we observed that increased expression of SRSF1 does not grossly affect the cell cycle profile (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), strongly suggesting that the observed increase in polysomal to subpolysomal ratios for these targets is primarily linked to SRSF1-mediated translation and not to an indirect effect on the cell cycle. Conversely, SRSF1 depletion led to major cell cycle aberrations (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), with approximately 50% of SRSF1-depleted cells remaining arrested in the G2/M phase. This could be caused by a loss of SRSF1-dependent translation of targets required for cell cycle progression, as we observed decreased association of these mRNA targets with polysomes in SRSF1-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), as well as decreased levels of the corresponding proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Importantly, the levels of SRSF1 itself do not change significantly throughout the cell cycle, albeit there is a 1.2-fold increase in SRSF1 protein levels from the G1 to S phase (<a href=\"#bib73\">Ly et al., 2014</a>). We cannot rule out, however, that the subcellular localization of SRSF1 is cell cycle regulated, which could potentially affect the translation of SRSF1 targets."

The proteasome inhibitor MG132 was added for 2 hr to HeLa cells in culture and the cell cycle profile was evaluated at different times following MG132 release (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). As previously demonstrated, proteasome inhibitors induce metaphase arrest (<a href=\"#bib114\">W\u00f3jcik et al., 1996</a>) and indeed following drug treatment we observed accumulation of cells in the prometaphase/metaphase stage of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Interestingly, while control cells proceeded through the normal stages of mitosis following MG132 withdrawal, HeLa cells that were depleted of SRSF1 remained arrested in metaphase, indicating that SRSF1 was required for normal mitotic progression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). To confirm this, we co-transfected HeLa cells with epitope-tagged GFP-tubulin and mCherry-H2B and compared the cell cycle stage of control cells and SRSF1-depleted cells by time-lapse imaging (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a>). The co-transfected proteins were used as markers to follow the cell cycle stage (for simplicity only the mCherry-H2B is shown). This analysis confirmed that SRSF1 is indeed essential for proper cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). Specifically, control cells underwent mitosis in around 50 min, whereas cells depleted of SRSF1 remained arrested in metaphase for several hours, and eventually either underwent cell division or apoptosis. We repeated this experiment in HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line stably expressing GFP-centromere protein A (CENPA). CENPA is homologous to histone H3 and replaces canonical H3 in the nucleosome core of centromeric chromatin. Thus, monitoring GFP-CENPA protein allows progression through mitosis to be followed. Similarly to what was observed in HeLa cells, SRSF1 depletion in HT1080 resulted in a significant, albeit less severe, increase in the time these cells spent in mitosis. Interestingly, the mitotic delay was partially rescued by restoring normal levels of SRSF1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>)."

We had previously demonstrated that SRSF1 functions as an adaptor protein to recruit the signaling molecules responsible for the regulation of cap-dependent translation of specific mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib77\">Michlewski et al., 2008</a>). Here, we present a transcriptome-wide view of the role of SRSF1 in mRNA translation. This analysis revealed that SRSF1 regulates the translation of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in many different cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, RNA processing, and mRNA translation itself (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). For instance, SRSF1 promotes the translation of PABP-interacting protein 1 (PAIP1), a positive regulator of translation that binds to eIF3 and stabilizes the interaction between PABP and eIF4G (<a href=\"#bib75\">Martineau et al., 2008</a>). The activity of SRSF1 in promoting the translation of endogenous targets is mTOR dependent; however, we did not find an effect of SRSF1 on the regulation of either 5\u2032TOP mRNAs or pyrimidine rich translational element (PRTE) mRNAs, which have been previously shown to be mTOR sensitive (<a href=\"#bib49\">Hsieh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Thoreen et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, approximately one third of the SRSF1 translational target mRNAs identified here were previously shown to be bona fide RNA targets of this SR protein by CLIP-seq, suggesting that these are direct translational targets (<a href=\"#bib88\">Sanford et al., 2009</a>). Recently, an interesting link between alternative splicing and the preferential association of alternative mRNA isoforms to the translational machinery was reported (<a href=\"#bib102\">Sterne-Weiler et al., 2013</a>). Here, we have analyzed changes in alternative splicing in response to different levels of SRSF1 protein. Our previous results have suggested that SRSF1 may act to coordinate the nuclear and cytoplasmic steps of post-transcriptional gene expression for a subset of pre-mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib85\">Sanford et al., 2008</a>). Here, we observed that mRNAs that display alternative splicing changes upon increased SRSF1 concentration were also translationally regulated by SRSF1. This suggests that SRSF1 influences several steps of the mRNA life cycle acting to couple nuclear events with mRNA translation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Interestingly, it was recently shown that SRSF3 regulates the alternative splicing of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) mRNA, but also negatively regulates its translational efficiency in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib59\">Kim et al., 2014</a>)."

Along the same lines, loss of another SR protein, SRSF2 (SC35) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts also results in a G2/M cell cycle arrest and genomic instability (<a href=\"#bib115\">Xiao et al., 2007</a>). SRSF1 and SRSF3 associate with interphase chromosomes and post-mitotic chromatin; however, during mitosis they are displaced from chromatin by phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 (<a href=\"#bib69\">Loomis et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, SRSF1 mRNA is deposited onto mitotic microtubules; however, the regulation of its translation during cell cycle is not currently understood (<a href=\"#bib14\">Blower et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, SRSF1 has been recently identified as a factor involved in centriole biogenesis, another mechanism essential for mitosis and genomic integrity. These findings suggest a potential role for SRSF1 in regulating chromatin function and cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#bib7\">Balestra et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "The oncogenic potential of SR proteins has so far being described in terms of the nuclear activities of SR proteins, most notably involving differential alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs involved in signaling and/or cellular transformation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ghigna et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Karni et al., 2007</a>). A recent study confirmed that the transformative potential of SRSF1 requires its splicing activity, since deletion of its first RRM (RRM1), which is required for pre-mRNA splicing, abrogates this activity. Nonetheless, this study also revealed that preventing the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of SRSF1 prevents its oncogenic potential, strongly suggesting a role for the translational activity of SRSF1 in its oncogenic activities (<a href=\"#bib98\">Shimoni-Sebag et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, SRSF1 as well as SRSF9 (SRp30c) have been recently shown to promote the translation of \u03b2-catenin in an mTOR-dependent manner and this activates Wnt signaling-mediated tumorigenesis. In agreement, SRSF9 displays oncogenic properties and its overexpression has been observed in multiple types of human tumors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Fu et al., 2013</a>). Results presented here strongly suggest that overexpressed SRSF1 could contribute to tumorigenesis by influencing the translational rate of key components of the cell cycle machinery. Indeed, many of the SRSF1 translational targets that we have identified here correspond to proteins with roles in chromosome segregation and cell cycle progression (data in Supplementary file 1 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib76\">Maslon et al. (2014)</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In particular, we found that SRSF1 has a role in regulating the translation of proteins that are required for mitotic spindle and kinetochore function. Importantly, altered expression of any of the spindle-associated proteins may contribute to unbalanced chromosome segregation during mitosis. Indeed, increased expression of NDC80 and SMC2 has been observed in cancer cells and an increased requirement for NDC80 at kinetochores of cancer cells has been postulated (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ferretti et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">D\u00e1valos et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, some SRSF1 translational targets, including NDC80 and centrosomal proteins, have been previously identified in an siRNA screen looking for proteins involved in centrosome clustering in cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib64\">Leber et al., 2010</a>). This suggests that the oncogenic function of SRSF1 could be partially due to its role in promoting the translation of factors that are involved in suppressing multipolar divisions in human tumor cells. Indeed, decreased levels of SRSF1 protein result in multipolar spindle formation and abnormal chromosomal alignment (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, we were able to rescue the multipolar spindle phenotype observed upon SRSF1 depletion only with overexpression of the wild-type SRSF1 protein. By contrast, increased expression of the nuclear-retained SRSF1-NRS did not rescue this phenotype, strongly suggesting a role for SRSF1-regulated translation in this process (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

Lately however, a crucial role for the translational regulation of hundreds of mRNAs required for cell cycle progression, including most of the mRNAs encoding proteins forming the cohesin and condensin complexes, has been uncovered (<a href=\"#bib103\">Stumpf et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, and despite the fact that our experiments were performed in an unsynchronized cell population, we observed an approximate 15% overlap between SRSF1 direct translational targets identified in this work and those genes that were shown to exhibit translation regulation during cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#bib103\">Stumpf et al., 2013</a> and this study), strongly suggesting that SRSF1 may have a central role in this event (Fisher's exact test: OR 1.466548, p=0.02611). Those overlapping targets include the condensin components, SMC2 and SMC4, the centrosomal protein CEP170, and the DNA repair protein MRE11A. Altogether, this suggests that SRSF1 could provide a transcript-specific mechanism for translational regulation of the cell cycle. Increased expression of SRSF1 would promote the increased translation of genes associated with cell division and this could partially explain the oncogenic role of SRSF1. In summary, these data provide insights on the complex role of SRSF1 in the control of gene expression and its implications in cancer."

The RNA quality was verified by the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Each array experiment was performed in triplicate. Array data analysis was performed by GenoSplice (<a href=\"www.genosplice.com\">www.genosplice.com</a>; Paris, France). Affymetrix Human JAY arrays were normalized using the probe scaling method and background corrected with ProbeEffect from GeneBase (<a href=\"#bib54\">Kapur et al., 2008</a>). The gene expression index was computed from probes that were selected using ProbeSelect from GeneBase (<a href=\"#bib54\">Kapur et al., 2008</a>). Gene expression signals were computed using these probes. Genes were considered expressed if mean intensity was \u2265200. Genes were considered regulated if: (1) they were expressed in at least one condition (i.e., SRSF1 and/or empty vector control); (2) fold-change was \u22651.5; and (3) the unpaired <i>t</i> test p value between gene intensities was \u22640.05. For each probe, a splicing index was computed. Unpaired <i>t</i> tests were performed to test the difference in probe expression between the two samples as described previously (<a href=\"#bib95\">Shen et al., 2010</a>). Probe p values in each probeset were then summarized using Fisher's method. Using annotation files, splicing patterns (cassette exons, 5\u2032/3\u2032 alternative splice sites, and mutually exclusive exons) were tested for difference between isoforms, selecting those with a minimum number of regulated probesets (with p\u22640.01) in each competing isoform (at least one third of \u2018exclusion\u2019 probesets have to be significant, and at least one third of \u2018inclusion\u2019 probesets have to be significant and show an opposite regulation for the splicing index compared to \u2018exclusion\u2019 probesets). For example, for a single cassette exon, the exclusion junction and at least one of the three inclusion probesets (one exon probeset and two inclusion junction probesets) have to be significant and have to show an opposite regulation for the splicing index."

At the physiological level, you show that this function of SRSF1 is required for mitotic progression. Using RNA-Seq you identified mRNAs that become enriched in polysome fractions upon overexpression of the SR protein SRSF1 in 293 cells. A fraction of these RNAs are directly bound by the protein and are therefore potential direct targets of translational regulation by SRSF1, a conclusion also supported by comparative proteomics data. Of interest, a significant fraction of genes whose alternative splicing is regulated by SRSF1 also show translational regulation, suggesting coordinated regulation of the two processes by this shuttling, multifunctional protein. Enrichment in genes involved in spindle/kinetochore formation led you to study the effects of SRSF1 knock down on cell division. Your results, supported by rescue experiments, indicate that SRSF1 is required for mitotic progression and proper spindle formation. This study will be appealing to the broad readership of <i>eLife</i>."

These effects could be particularly significant for the cohorts of genes whose expression (including translation) is restricted to specific phases of cell cycle. Along these lines, is the expression of SRSF1 constant throughout the cell cycle?"

In the past it has also been shown by you and others that SRSF1 can affect signaling pathways that impinge on translational machinery (mTOR and MAPK). Hence it appears that SRSF1 may affect translation via variety of mechanisms and that this could likely comprise different subclasses of SRSF1 mRNA targets. Therefore dissecting these mechanisms and/or commenting and discussing on these issues would (at least in this reviewer's opinion) improve the present manuscript by providing additional insights in the circuitry of the SRSF1 translation regulation network."

First, we observed that increased expression of SRSF1 under the conditions used in the polysomal shift analysis, does not grossly affect the cell cycle profile (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>), strongly suggesting that the observed increase in polysomal to subpolysomal ratios for these targets is primarily linked to SRSF1-mediated translation and not to an indirect effect on the cell cycle. By contrast, SRSF1 depletion led to major cell cycle aberrations (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>), with approximately 50 % of SRSF1-depleted cells remaining arrested in G2/M phase. This suggests that a certain threshold of SRSF1 is required to progress normally through the cell cycle. This could be caused, at least partially, by a loss of SRSF1-dependent translation of targets required for cell cycle progression, as we observed decreased association of these mRNA targets with polysomes in SRSF1-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), as well as decreased levels of the corresponding proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

This activity is mediated by interactions of SRSF1 with components of the mTOR signaling pathway. However, this was shown with mRNA reporters. In order to determine whether endogenous SRSF1 translational targets responded to the same mechanism of translational activation we treated cells transiently expressing SRSF1 (or control cells) with a specific inhibitor of the mTOR kinase, PP242 (Dowling et al. 2010) and then measured polysomal to subpolysomal ratios of a subset of selected SRSF1 translational targets. Interestingly, we found that inhibition of mTOR abrogated the stimulatory activity of SRSF1 on the translation of selected targets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This demonstrates that the activity of SRSF1 in translational activation of endogenous targets requires the mTOR pathway."
