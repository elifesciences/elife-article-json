Since consolidation occurs during sleep, even fleeting experiences when animals are awakened may produce maladaptive long-term memory, or may interrupt consolidation. In a learning paradigm affecting <i>Aplysia</i> feeding, when animals were trained after being awakened from sleep, interactions between new experiences and consolidation were prevented by blocking long-term memory arising from the new experiences. Inhibiting protein synthesis eliminated the block and allowed even a brief, generally ineffective training to produce long-term memory. Memory formation depended on consolidative proteins already expressed before training. After effective training, long term memory required subsequent transcription and translation. Memory formation during the sleep phase was correlated with increased CREB1 transcription, but not CREB2 transcription. Increased C/EBP transcription was a correlate of both effective and ineffective training and of treatments not producing memory."

The interactions can lead to problems in keeping apart related memories. This problem is partially solved by deferring some of the memory consolidation to sleep, a period in which new experiences are minimized. However, experiences when animals are wakened from sleep are likely to interact with the ongoing consolidation, thereby potentially causing maladaptive memories. We have found that during the sleep phase consolidation, new experiences produce a protein synthesis dependent process that blocks the formation of new memories, thereby preventing the formation of maladaptive memories."

An experience that occurs while a memory is being consolidated may interfere with the consolidation, and partially stops it. Indeed, the process of memory consolidation was discovered over 100 years ago by interference of memory formation as a result of a new learning trial (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lechner et al., 1999</a>). Only much later was consolidation shown to depend on gene transcription and translation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Montarolo et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sweatt, 2010</a>), and dependence on these molecular processes has become the defining feature of consolidation. A second interaction between an experience and an ongoing consolidation has been more recently discovered. An experience that is generally ineffective in producing long-term memory can become effective when it occurs during the consolidation of a memory that arises from another, effective experience. This phenomenon was originally described on a synaptic level, and was called synaptic tagging and capture, since training at synapses that have undergone short-term plasticity produces local tags (<a href=\"#bib17\">Frey and Morris, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Martin et al., 1997</a>). These tags can capture molecular products that are synthesized as a result of a consolidation process that arises from another training. Capture at the tags causes expression of long-term memory at synapses that would otherwise only display short-term memory. More recent studies have demonstrated behavioral tagging that is analogous to the synaptic tagging (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ballarini et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">de Carvalho Myskiw et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Moncada and Viola, 2007;</a><a href=\"#bib43\">\u00a0Moncado et al., 2015</a>)."

There is now abundant evidence that after completion of the early stages of consolidation which follow an experience, an additional stage of consolidation occurs while animals sleep (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rasch and Born, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Walker and Stickgold, 2006</a>), primarily during the night for diurnally active animals, or during the day for nocturnally active animals. Similar processes may govern consolidation that immediately follows training, and that during sleep. Memory consolidation and cortical plasticity during sleep are also accompanied by, or is dependent on protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gr\u00f8nli et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rasch and Born, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Seibt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tudor et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Walker, 2005</a>). There is also a general increase in cerebral protein synthesis during sleep phases associated with memory consolidation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ramm and Smith, 1990</a>). In addition, molecular events associated with memory consolidation during sleep are similar to those induced during consolidation following training (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href=\"#bib36\">Luo et al., 2013</a>). Consolidation-like processes occur during sleep even in the absence of a previous training trial. Animals and humans sleep every day, even when no overt training occurred in the previous active phase. Proteins supporting consolidation will be synthesized during sleep, even when sleep does not follow overt training (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ramm and Smith, 1990</a>)."

A transient experience that would not cause long-term memory could be amplified by the ongoing consolidation, and cause an unwanted long-term memory. The amplification of the experience could then in turn increase the possibility that the new experience will interfere with consolidation of the earlier memory during sleep. One way of preventing interference is to prevent new experiences by losing consciousness. Indeed, the earliest papers (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jenkins and Dallenbach, 1924</a>) showing that sleep improves memory posited that it does so passively, by preventing interference from new experiences. In recent years it has become clear that active processes also strengthen memories while animals sleep (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rasch and Born, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Walker and Stickgold, 2006</a>). However, the presence of active processes promoting consolidation during sleep strengthens the need to limit experiences, or the potential memories elicited by such experiences, while memories are consolidated. Animals and humans often wake from sleep, and experiences during such times should interfere with consolidation. However, paradoxically, training during the inactive phase, when animals are awakened from sleep, is often relatively ineffective in producing memory (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lyons et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Michel and Lyons, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Page, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rawashdeh et al., 2007</a>)."

If such a block is present, one would predict that if the block is removed, experiences adjacent to sleep should become more effective in initiating long-term memory. Under this condition, experiences that do not cause long-term memory when animals are active should cause long-term memory."

Training produces a gradual decrease in responsiveness to food, and animals stop responding after 10\u201325 min of training. Training during the active phase of the day produces short, intermediate, long-term (<a href=\"#bib9\">Botzer et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Michel et al., 2013</a>), and persistent (<a href=\"#bib32\">Levitan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schwarz et al., 1991</a>) memories, with the long-term memory dependent on protein synthesis adjacent to the training and persistent memory dependent on a somewhat later round of protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib33\">Levitan et al., 2010</a>). Training during the inactive, sleep phase of the day is ineffective in producing long-term memory (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lyons et al., 2005</a>). We now report that training during the sleep phase can be made effective by treatment with a short-acting inhibitor of protein synthesis. This treatment permits even experiences that are too brief to cause long-term memory to become effective. Thus, protein synthesis following training has opposite effects on memory resulting from training during the active or the sleep phase, blocking the former while enabling the latter. Our findings indicate that training during the sleep phase initiates an active protein-synthesis dependent process that blocks the formation of new long-term memories. In addition, when the active block is removed, long-term memory formation is no longer dependent on protein synthesis at the time of the training. However, long-term memory formation is dependent on transcription and translation a number of hours after training."

We found no changes in CREB2 expression. Treatments that did and that did not cause memory formation led to increased C/EBP expression, indicating that C/EBP expression is not sufficient for memory formation. By contrast, only a treatment causing long-term memory caused a significant increase in the expression of CREB1, indicating that this increase is a correlate of memory formation."

Our aim was to test the hypothesis that this training is ineffective, because it is adaptive to prevent new learning during an ongoing process of memory consolidation that occurs during sleep. If the training during sleep phase were effective two problems would arise: (1) the molecular events underlying consolidation could enhance the efficacy of the training at this time, leading to dysfunctional long-term memory of events that would otherwise not be remembered; (2) new learning during sleep phase consolidation could interfere with the consolidation. We hypothesize: (a) training during the sleep phase induces the synthesis of an active blocker of memory formation. If the blocker is removed, we predict: (b) the\u00a0ongoing consolidation process will enhance the ability of training to produce long-term memory. In addition, if the ongoing consolidation is itself blocked, we predict: (c) training will no longer produce long-term memory. These predictions were tested."

                                "text": "It was first important to show that <i>Aplysia</i> consolidate memory during sleep. Similar to almost all animals, <i>Aplysia</i> display a circadian rhythm of activity. They spend most of their inactive phase immobile, and relatively unresponsive to external stimuli (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kupfermann, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Strumwasser, 1971</a>). Recent work has shown that immobility during the inactive phase has characteristics of sleep (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vorster et al., 2014</a>). In mammals, memory consolidation occurs in part during the inactive phase, while animals sleep (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rasch and Born, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Walker and Stickgold, 2006</a>). Since consolidation generally depends on protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Montarolo et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sweatt, 2010</a>), an effective way to examine whether consolidation occurs during sleep is to block protein synthesis at this time, and then determine whether this treatment blocks memory formation. To this end, <i>Aplysia</i> were trained with inedible food during the active period, and were treated with 10 \u00b5M of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin 12 hr later, during the sleep phase. A previous study had already shown that injecting 10 \u00b5M anisomycin 10 min before training during the active phase blocked the expression of memory 24 hr later (<a href=\"#bib33\">Levitan et al., 2010</a>). Thus, consolidation occurs during the hours following training. However, 10 \u00b5M anisomycin applied several hours after training did not block 24 hr memory (<a href=\"#bib33\">Levitan et al., 2010</a>). Before treatment with anisomycin, we confirmed that all of the animals were immobile, and presumably were asleep. Treatment with 10 \u00b5M anisomycin, but not with the vehicle (artificial seawater - ASW) 12 hr after training blocked 24 hr memory (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Thus, after a period in which protein synthesis is not required, 24 hr memory again depends on protein synthesis, during the inactive phase, when <i>Aplysia</i> sleep. This experiment confirms that active memory consolidation occurs during sleep in <i>Aplysia</i>, and that consolidation can be interrupted by blocking protein synthesis."

In all figures standard errors are shown. Experiments in this figure were performed on the diurnally active <i>A. californica.</i> (<b>A</b>) Blocking protein synthesis during the sleep phase blocks 24 hr memory. Animals were trained during their active phase (day), and were tested 24 hr later. 12 hr after training, during the sleep phase, animals were injected with ASW (<i>N</i>\u00a0=\u00a09) or with 10 \u00b5M anisomycin (<i>N</i>\u00a0=\u00a012).

(1) Training animals during the sleep phase (<i>N</i>\u00a0=\u00a05) did not lead to long-term memory, as shown by a lack of savings when animals were tested 24 hr later (p=0.3, <i>t</i>\u00a0=\u00a01.12, <i>df</i>\u00a0=\u00a04; two-tailed paired <i>t</i>-test).

Using a number of learning paradigms, including learning with inedible food (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lyons et al., 2005</a>), training during the inactive sleep phase was ineffective in producing memory tested 24 hr later. We confirmed that training with inedible food during the sleep phase (3\u20136 hr after the change in lighting) does not produce 24 hr memory (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B1</a>). In this experiment, all animals were inactive and presumably asleep before being awakened and trained. The inability to detect 24 hr memory after training during the sleep period reflects an inability to form a new memory, rather than an inability to retrieve the memory. As shown previously (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lyons et al., 2005</a>), memory is readily retrieved and expressed during the inactive period, as demonstrated by the presence of memory at night 36 hr after training during the active period (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A2</a>). This experiment indicates that a blocker of memory formation is active during the sleep phase. The blocker prevents experiences that would have given rise to memory during the active phase from doing so during the sleep phase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B2</a>)."

However, we found that the 3 min training 10 min after 10 \u00b5M anisomycin treatment during the active phase was ineffective in producing long-term memory (data not shown). Thus, this combination is effective in producing memory only during the sleep phase, presumably because of the ongoing consolidation process."

They were treated 10 min before training with either 10 \u00b5M anisomycin <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), or with ASW <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). A third group was treated with 10 \u00b5M anisomycin, but was not trained (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Only the animals that were trained after treatment with 10 \u00b5M anisomycin displayed 24 hr memory. This experiment shows that both an abbreviated and a longer training session are effective in producing memory after treatment with 10 \u00b5M anisomycin. In addition it shows that anisomycin alone during the sleep phase is ineffective in producing memory without training."

Our interpretation is that a protein-synthesis dependent blocker of memory is inhibited by the anisomycin, and therefore is not present to suppress memory formation. However, consolidation leading to long-term memory generally requires protein synthesis. Even if it inhibited synthesis of the blocker, why was long-term memory formed when protein synthesis was blocked? We suggest that the proteins having a role in memory consolidation are either specifically expressed during sleep, or are expressed more strongly during sleep. These proteins are expressed even in the absence of an explicit training during the previous active phase, and their presence substitutes for the proteins synthesized just after training during the active phase. These proteins are synthesized throughout the sleep phase, and in our experiments they were already expressed when animals were trained later in the sleep phase. Their expression explains why training can produce long-term memory with a protein synthesis inhibitor."

However, the new experiences themselves initiate an additional process of protein synthesis that blocks the formation of new memories, explaining why training during the sleep phase is generally ineffective in causing long-term memory. Treatment with 10 \u00b5M anisomycin just before training blocks synthesis of the memory blocker, leaving intact the previously synthesized proteins associated with consolidation that enhance memory formation (see Figure 5E)."

We predict that blocking the protein synthesis associated with consolidation will block long-term memory formation during the sleep phase, even if the memory blocker induced by training is also not present. Since consolidation is likely to occur throughout the sleep phase, a short-acting blocker of protein synthesis that is applied early in the sleep phase may block the proteins that support consolidation, but will no longer be present at a later time, when animals are trained. In intact animals, the length of time that anisomycin effectively blocks protein synthesis depends on the concentration used. Smaller doses of anisomycin transiently block protein synthesis, whereas larger doses have longer-lasting effects (<a href=\"#bib16\">Flood et al., 1973</a>). To find a transiently active dosage of anisomycin, we examined the effects of different concentrations at different times before a full training session during the active phase. We found that 10 \u00b5M anisomycin was effective in blocking memory formation 1 hr before training (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), but was not effective 2 hr before training (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). By contrast, a three times larger dose (30 \u00b5M anisomycin) was still effective in blocking memory formation when injected 2.5 hr before training (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). We also tested the effect of a dosage of anisomycin that is a third of that used previously (3.3 \u00b5M in place of 10 \u00b5M anisomycin), and found that this concentration injected 10 min before training is too low to inhibit long-term memory formation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Thus, 10 \u00b5M anisomycin is close to threshold in blocking protein synthesis, and its effect is relatively short-lasting. Injection of this concentration early in the sleep phase, 2 hr or more before training, will not affect synthesis of the proposed memory blocker, but will affect synthesis of proteins that support consolidation during sleep."

However, we have shown that memory formation at night only occurs when protein synthesis is blocked just preceding the training, although protein synthesis in the hours preceding training is necessary for long-term memory formation. Consolidation is a slow process, and is dependent on a number of waves of mRNA and protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barzilai et al., 1989</a>). The effects of 10 \u00b5M anisomycin are relatively short-lasting (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). After training, one might still expect that long-term memory formation will depend on molecular signals initiating transcription of mRNAs, and their subsequent translation, after the effects of anisomycin present during or just after training have worn off. To determine whether memory formation is dependent on transcription, we examined the effects of the reversible transcription blocker 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole 1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranoside (DRB) on memory formation.

In addition, it did not facilitate memory formation during the inactive phase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A3</a>), presumably because the dose is too low to block protein synthesis sufficiently. However, 3.3 \u00b5M anisomycin still caused a large (over 80-fold) increase in C/EBP expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The difference between C/EBP production during the sleep phase in response to 10 \u00b5M or 3.3 \u00b5M anisomycin was not significant.

If this is so, training with 10 \u00b5M anisomycin at night should produce an increase in C/EBP over that produced by anisomycin alone, whereas training with ASW at night should produce no increase in C/EBP expression over that produced by ASW alone. We tested this possibility by measuring C/EBP expression 2 hr after a 3 min training with ASW or with 10 \u00b5M anisomycin. A 3 min training with ASW causes no long-term memory (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), but nonetheless caused a 7-fold increase in C/EBP expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A1</a>), which is similar to the increase in C/EBP expression caused by training during the day (<a href=\"#bib31\">Levitan et al., 2008</a>). A 3 min training after treatment with 10 \u00b5M anisomycin also caused a significant increase in C/EBP expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A2</a>). Note that the increased C/EBP expression after anisomycin treatment is 2 orders of magnitude larger than that after ASW treatment, because of the effect of the anisomycin. However, in both conditions training caused an increase in C/EBP expression. These data indicate that increased C/EBP mRNA expression is not a necessary correlate of memory formation."

We examined the possibility that the expression of two additional genes associated with memory formation, cAMP- response element-binding proteins 1 and 2 (CREB1 and CREB2) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2008</a>), are changed by doses of anisomycin that facilitate memory formation. Since CREB2 is a repressor of memory formation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bartsch et al., 1995</a>), regulation of CREB2 might be associated with the block of memory during the sleep phase. As noted above, 3.3 \u00b5M anisomycin does not block memory formation during the active phase, or facilitate memory formation during the inactive phase, whereas 10 \u00b5M anisomycin is effective in blocking memory during the active phase, and enhancing memory formation during the inactive phase. If 10 \u00b5M anisomycin were to significantly change the expression of one of these genes, over that expressed after treatment with 3.3 \u00b5M anisomycin, this change could underlie the ability of training during the inactive phase to cause long-term memory. Unlike the effect of anisomycin on C/EBP, neither 3.3 \u00b5M nor 10 \u00b5M anisomycin during the inactive phase produced significant increases in the expression of CREB1 or of CREB2, with respect to expression after treatment with ASW, although both concentrations produced moderate increases that approached significance (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, and legend \u2013 note that the bars are normalized to expression after ASW, which is 100%). There were no significant differences in expression between treatment with 3.3 \u00b5M and 10 \u00b5M anisomycin (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), effectively ruling out changed expression of either of these two genes as a result of anisomycin treatment alone from being the underlying cause of memory formation with anisomycin treatment during the inactive phase."

As shown above, C/EBP expression is significantly increased by a 3 min training at night, whether or not the training produces memory. Thus, its increase is a correlate of training, but not a correlate of memory formation. We also examined changes in the expression of CREB1 or CREB2 in the buccal ganglia 2 hr after a 3 min training during the inactive phase after treatment with either ASW or anisomycin. CREB1, but not CREB2 expression was significantly increased only after treatment with anisomycin (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B1 and B2</a>), indicating that increased CREB1 expression is a molecular correlate of long-term memory formation in our learning paradigm. Since C/EBP expression is downstream from CREB1 expression (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alberini et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Shifrin and Anderson, 1999</a>), and there is no increase in CREB1 expression in ineffective training, transcription factors other than CREB1, or the CREB1 protein that is already present and phosphorylated, must be driving expression of C/EBP in the buccal ganglia in ineffective training. Thus, the combination of anisomycin and training during the inactive phase has an effect on a specific mRNA whose product supports memory formation, CREB1. By contrast, CREB2 expression was not changed by training after treatment with either ASW or with anisomycin, indicating that its expression is not altered by the training procedure, when the training does or does not produce long-term memory."

However, in most of our experiments animals were not explicitly trained in the previous active phase, raising the question of why consolidation occurs in the absence of previous training. Processes related to consolidation may not occur only after an explicit training trial. Animals and humans sleep every night, even when no training occurred in the previous day, and sleep-phase consolidation products are likely to be synthesized even without overt training during the previous waking phase (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ramm and Smith, 1990</a>). The consolidation may be relevant to the processing of the normal experiences of previous active phase, but even in the most boring environments in which there is little new to learn, animals sleep."

In addition, anisomycin treatment during the first hours of the sleep phase, 2 hr before training, blocks memory formation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), because the synthesis of proteins synthesized during sleep has been blocked, and they can no longer support memory formation when animals are subsequently trained. This treatment may be effective because protein synthesis was blocked before factors required for consolidation were synthesized.

Overexpression of C/EBP mRNA could produce overexpression of C/EBP protein, after the blocking effects of anisomycin have worn off, and could thereby allow a single stimulus that is insufficient to produce long-term facilitation to become effective (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2001</a>). Thus, it is possible that the increased expression of C/EBP mRNA is sufficient to overcome the block of protein synthesis, and explains the ability of training to give rise to long-term memory.

To determine the possible contribution of the increased C/EBP transcription to learning during the sleep phase, in addition to its role as a blocker of protein synthesis, we would need to identify another short-acting protein synthesis inhibitor without the additional effects of anisomycin. Anisomycin causes increased C/EBP synthesis both during the active phase and during the sleep phase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), but blocks memory in the former (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), whereas it is necessary for memory in the latter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). If increased C/EBP expression explains the ability to form memory during the sleep phase in the absence of protein synthesis, it should also promote memory formation in the absence of protein synthesis during the active phase. In addition, <a href=\"#bib37\">Lyons et al. (2006)</a> tested whether a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor which pharmacologically induces an increase in MAP-kinase activity during the sleep phase restored the ability of a training procedure causing long term facilitation of withdrawal reflexes to be effective in producing long-term memory. They found that this treatment alone was insufficient to allow training during the inactive phase to be effective. Training at night was effective in producing memory only when the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor was paired with a pharmacological agent that inhibits histone de-acetylation, which led to increased overall RNA expression. We also showed a dissociation between increased C/EBP expression and memory formation. Thus, a dose of anisomycin (3.3 \u00b5M) that is too low to block active phase memory formation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) induced an increase in C/EBP mRNA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), but did not permit memory formation after training during the sleep phase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A3</a>). In addition, C/EBP expression was increased after training in isolated <i>Aplysia</i> that are unable to form long-term memories (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schwarz et al., 1998</a>) as much as it is in animals that are trained with conspecifics, which do form long-term memory (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The increased C/EBP mRNA caused by training (<a href=\"#bib31\">Levitan et al., 2008</a>), and the requirement for C/EBP for memory formation in other learning tasks (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alberini, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alberini et al., 1994</a>) indicates that increased C/EBP mRNA expression is necessary, but is not consistently sufficient for long-term memory formation, perhaps because the downstream effects of C/EBP expression are regulated."

Although no similar long-term memory has been identified previously in <i>Aplysia</i>, it is conceivable that such a mechanism exists, and is present during the sleep phase. However, it is not clear why such memory would not also be expressed after active-phase training with a protein synthesis inhibitor. In addition, we found that the transcription inhibitor DRB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), as well as 30 \u00b5M anisomycin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A2</a>) adjacent to training, blocked memory formation during the sleep phase, as did 10 \u00b5M anisomycin 2 hr before the training (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

The higher the dose of anisomycin used, the more effective it is in blocking memory (<a href=\"#bib16\">Flood et al., 1973</a>). Indeed, we found that 30 \u00b5M, but not 10 \u00b5M anisomycin prevents memory formation during the sleep phase, whereas both concentrations are effective during the active phase. However, this hypothesis is highly unlikely, since 10 \u00b5M anisomycin did effectively block memory when applied 2 hr, but not 0.5 hr before training (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Thus, the concentration of anisomycin required to block protein synthesis is not different during the sleep phase from that required during the active phase. However, the time at which the protein synthesis blocker is present is critical. Anisomycin applied 2 hr before training is likely to block production of proteins that participate in memory consolidation, whose presence is required at the time of the training. The higher dose of anisomycin at training is likely to be effective in blocking memory formation because it also blocks protein synthesis for a longer time (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>), and therefore affects the translation of proteins from mRNAs that are transcribed as a result of training."

This does not occur: the blocker also blocks memory following a longer training that produces long-term memory during the active phase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We propose that even these memories are blocked to prevent new learning from interfering with the consolidation. This is consistent with what may be the primary function of partially deferring consolidation to sleep, the prevention of new experiences from interfering with consolidation. The earliest papers (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jenkins and Dallenbach, 1924</a>) showing that sleep improves memory posited that it does so passively, by preventing interference from new experiences. In recent years it has become clear that active processes also strengthen memories while animals sleep (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rasch and Born, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Walker and Stickgold, 2006</a>). However, the presence of active processes promoting consolidation during sleep strengthens the need to limit experiences while memories are consolidated. In addition, lack of consciousness may not be sufficient to protect the consolidating memories from interference, since one can learn during sleep (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arzi et al., 2012</a>), or when awaked from sleep, as in our experiments. An active, protein synthesis dependent process that blocks long-term memory formation to new experiences is an effective solution to prevent interference with consolidation. When this process is blocked by an inhibitor of protein synthesis, new experiences are able to produce long-term memory."

In addition, injecting the anisomycin 10 min before training was sufficient to block the blocker.

In addition, inactive phase training until animals stop responding causes short-term memory when tested 0.5 hr after training (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lyons et al., 2005</a>), indicating that second messenger cascades which produce short-term memory, and that can also begin to signal long-term memory (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kandel, 2012</a>), are likely to be intact. The behavioral effects of short - and long-term memory are very similar: both are food specific, both show decreased attempts to swallow, both display a reduced time to stop responding (<a href=\"#bib9\">Botzer et al., 1998</a>) and both are sensitive to blocking NO (<a href=\"#bib25\">Katzoff et al., 2002</a>). The similarity in behavioral effects suggests that both short and long-term memory arise from similar synaptic changes in circuit elements that are common to the expression of both long-term and short-term memory. Thus, the blocker is likely to act on mechanisms that are specific to long-term memory formation, but at sites that support both short-term and long-term memory. The blocker is also unlikely to act on ongoing processes supporting consolidation of memories laid down during the previous day, since doing so would defeat the presumed function of the blocker. Thus, if proteins supporting memory are synthesized during the inactive phase to facilitate memory consolidation, the blocker is unlikely to operate by preventing this synthesis, or by preventing the proteins supporting memory from interacting with their targets, since such a process would also interfere with the consolidation."

Effects of the blocker downstream from MAP-kinase and C/EBP might explain why others (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2001</a>) have found that overexpression of C/EBP, or a pharmacological increase in tyrosine kinase activity leading to increased MAPK (<a href=\"#bib49\">Purcell et al., 2003</a>) and probably increased C/EBP expression enhance memory formation in other learning tasks affecting <i>Aplysia</i>, whereas we have found that even a natural increase in C/EBP mRNA expression after training may have no effect on memory formation during the inactive phase (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Presumably, the blocker was not expressed in their experiments. As noted above <a href=\"#bib37\">Lyons et al.

CREB1 transcription is upstream from C/EBP expression, but is under feedback control, so blocking processes downstream from C/EBP could block feedback control of CREB1 expression, and thereby account for the difference in CREB1 expression in the presence and absence of memory formation. However, we found that the treatment with anisomycin caused modest increases in the expression of both CREB1 and CREB2 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), independent of training, indicating that block of CREB1 transcription cannot be the only site of action of the blocker. Given the previous findings of <a href=\"#bib37\">Lyons et al. (2006)</a>, it is not surprising that the blocker may act at more than one site."

This raised the possibility that the blocker of memory formation during the inactive phase is related to a relative increase in CREB2 expression, with respect to that of CREB1. If this were true, one might expect that CREB2 would be elevated as a result of training during the inactive phase. However, we found no evidence of elevated transcription of CREB2.

The increase in CREB1 expression was similar in magnitude to that after a 3 min training with anisomycin during the inactive phase. In addition, there was no significant change in CREB2 expression. Thus, we have no evidence that CREB2 transcription is related to expression of the memory blocker, or that the memory blocker is also expressed during active-phase training, at least for the first few hours after training. It is important to note that CREB2 transcription could still have a major role in the regulation of memory formation in our system. <a href=\"#bib21\">Hu et al. (2015)</a> showed that post-synaptic increases in CREB2 and c-jun underlie a persistent increase in synaptic strength, along with presynaptic decreases. In our behavioral paradigm, a full training during the active phase produces separable long-term (24 hr) and persistent (48 hr and longer) memories (<a href=\"#bib33\">Levitan et al., 2010</a>). The persistent memory after training with inedible food requires protein synthesis 6 hr after training, which is not required for 24 hr memory (<a href=\"#bib33\">Levitan et al., 2010</a>). We have not determined whether the brief training with anisomycin during the inactive phase produces only 24 hr memory, or also a more persistent memory. If the training produces a persistent memory, it could require changes in CREB2 expression 6 hr or more after training, similar to the post-synaptic increases seen by <a href=\"#bib21\">Hu et al. (2015)</a> for persistent synaptic plasticity. However, since they found that CREB2 expression decreases presynaptically but increases postsynaptically, examining expression in the whole buccal ganglia might not find these changes, if presynaptic and postsynaptic changes balance one another."

In humans, an odor stimulus was used to reactivate a memory while awake, or during slow-wave sleep (SWS). The reactivation was followed by an interference task. Reactivation and interference destabilized memory while awake, but not during SWS (<a href=\"#bib13\">Diekelmann et al., 2011</a>). In another study, after an odor training during the waking period, rats were exposed to an artificial pattern of stimulation of the olfactory bulb during waking or during SWS. The pattern disrupted memory when animals were awake, but during sleep induced generalization of memory, rather than disrupting it (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barnes and Wilson, 2014</a>). Thus, in both studies the disruptive effects of a stimulus were actively blocked during sleep. In these experiments, an external stimulus was used to trigger an experience. However, most experiences during sleep are not initiated by outward events. These experiences (dreams) are not easily remembered, perhaps because they initiate the synthesis of a blocker, even if they are part of the consolidation process. Our current work suggests that blocking of memory formation is a protein synthesis dependent process, and its presence in <i>Aplysia</i> indicates that blocking mechanisms have deep roots in the phylogeny of all animals that sleep."

As training proceeds many bites fail to cause entry of food into the mouth. When food does enter the mouth, it stays within for progressively shorter periods, eliciting fewer attempted swallows. In some experiments, training proceeded until the animals stopped responding to food, which was defined as a lack of entry of food into the mouth for 3 min. In experiments in which the initial training was continued until the animals stopped responding (full training), data were included only from animals in which food was in the mouth eliciting failed attempts to swallow for at least 100 s, since previous experience (<a href=\"#bib32\">Levitan et al., 2012</a>) showed that such animals almost always show long-term memory. Animals in which food was not in the mouth for 100 s during a full training were discarded. A full training session until animals stop responding to food requires 10\u201325 min of training. Animals that stopped responding in less than 5 min were discarded. Such a training session causes long-term memory measured after 24 hr. In other experiments, training was terminated 3 min after the first response to food. In these experiments, criterion for inclusion in the experiment was 50 s of food in the mouth."

Animals which showed stress as a result of the injection, and which inked profusely, were discarded. The specific time before training at which the anisomycin was injected was often part of the experimental design, and is always noted when the experiment is described. Animals were generally injected with a 1 cc solution of anisomycin at a concentration that caused a 10 \u00b5M concentration within the animals. The volume of the whole animal was measured by displacement in a beaker of seawater, and this volume was considered to be the volume of the solvent. This concentration blocks protein synthesis in ganglia (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schwartz et al., 1971</a>). Controls were injected with one cc artificial seawater (ASW - NaCl 460 mM, KCl 10 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub>11 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub>55 mM and NaHCO<sub>3</sub>5 mM). In some experiment, animals were injected with anisomycin so as to achieve concentrations within the animal of either 3.3 \u00b5M or 30 \u00b5M. In some experiments, the reversible transcription inhibitor 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole 1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranoside (DRB) was injected into animals within 2\u20133 min following training. DRB is not soluble in an aqueous solution, and in previous experiments in which it was used in dissected tissues it was dissolved in DMSO (<a href=\"#bib50\">Raju et al., 1991</a>). We have found that injecting even one cc of DMSO into behaving animals inhibits feeding. For this reason, ethanol was used as a solvent. DRB (3 mg) was dissolved in 180 \u00b5l of absolute ethanol, and then was diluted to a volume of 3 ml with ASW, and injected into 100 g animals. Dosage was adjusted when smaller or larger animals were used."

In most experiments, the expression of target mRNAs was normalized to the expression of Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA, whose expression is not thought to be regulated by training, and which has been used extensively as a housekeeping control gene (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href=\"#bib21\">Hu et al., 2015</a>). In a single experiment (that shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) that was performed much earlier than the rest of the experiments, histone H4 was used as the housekeeping gene. This gene was also used in previous work as a housekeeping gene (<a href=\"#bib31\">Levitan et al., 2008</a>). The value of C/EBP/GAPDH, CREB1/GAPDH or of CREB2/GAPDH obtained for each experimental or control animal was further normalized and expressed as a percentage of the mean value of the normalized gene expression in control, untrained animals run in the same experiment, which was set at 100%. Thus, each ganglion from an untrained animal has a different value, but the mean of all these values was set at 100%.

The paper examines the role of protein synthesis in new learning during an inactive, sleep-like behavioral state in the marine mollusk <i>Aplysia</i>. The authors use a learning protocol (which they developed previously) in which the animal learns that a food is inedible. Here, seaweed is wrapped in a plastic net and then presented to <i>Aplysia</i>. Initially, animals attempt to swallow the seaweed, but eventually, as they learn that the food cannot be swallowed, the number of attempted swallows declines. Full training proceeds until the animals cease swallowing altogether; this learning requires about 10-25 min in na\u00efve animals. Full training produces long-term memory (LTM), which persists for \u2a7e 24 h."

A significant conceptual problem for the dependence of memory consolidation on processes that occur during sleep, is that new experiences or neural activity during this period may be amplified by ongoing consolidation and thereby cause a spurious LTM that could interfere with the original memory. Here, the authors explore the hypothesis that new learning is actively suppressed during the sleep phase."

Remarkably, identical pharmacological treatment following training in the active phase blocks LTM. This crucial observation suggests: (a) that almost the entire spectrum of proteins and mRNAs required for LTM expression are normally expressed during sleep (b) that 3-minute or full LTM training during sleep (but apparently not in waking animals) is associated with protein-synthesis dependent expression of a blocker of new memory formation. Brief inhibition of protein synthesis could perturb the expression of this blocker, and thereby allows LTM consolidation in training-activated circuits through LTM consolidation proteins naturally expressed in the sleep phase."

Moreover, others have used cyclohexamide successfully to block long-term memory in the intact terrestrial snail, Limax (Matsuo et al., 2002) and intact cuttlefish, a cephalopod mollusk (Agin et al., 2003). So, the lack of availability of an alternate protein synthesis inhibitor does not seem an adequate justification for not doing the experiment. The authors are requested to reconsider their stance.

This is consistent with the demonstrated increases in C/EBP mRNA expression caused by training even when the blocker is active, and by the lack of effect of 3.3 \u00b5M anisomycin on memory formation, in spite of its large effect on C/EBP mRNA synthesis. A blocker downstream from C/EBP transcription would explain why previous reports succeeded in amplifying the ability to form long-term memory by procedures that increase MAPK and C/EBP, whereas we do not.

One possibility is that 3.3 \u00b5M anisomycin blocks a memory blocker that is also expressed during the active phase, thereby producing memory with even a brief training. This is the suggestion of the reviewer. However, another possibility is that 3.3 \u00b5M anisomycin causes a large increase in MAPK and C/EBP (as shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), thereby permitting even a brief training to produce long-term memory. This does not occur in the inactive phase, since the memory blocker acts downstream from MAPK and C/EBP.

These are a potentially important experiment since they will shed light on a target at which the memory blocker works. However, since the experiment proposed by the reviewers cannot alone resolve the question that they raise, we respectfully say that these experiments are beyond the scope of the present paper, and will be important for a follow-up that directly examines the mechanism of the blocker.

In writing the paper, we debated among ourselves whether or not to make this comparison, and if so, what it meant. Interestingly, our preliminary interpretation was that the anisomycin treatment produced extra large savings, rather than the conclusion raised by the reviewer, that 3 min alone reduced the savings. We decided <i>not</i> to draw attention to this point, since there is a fair amount of variability from replication to replication in the percent savings, and the values both with and without anisomycin are well within the range seen in other experiments. For example, the savings without anisomycin are comparable to those shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> for active phase learning and memory, and savings with anisomycin are comparable to those shown in in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> for active phase learning and memory. In general, over the years we have made few or no inferences about possible differences in the relative strength of savings after training, because of this variability. It would take a very large N to make a convincing argument on whether the savings when treated with anisomycin are meaningfully different from those without anisomycin. We do not think that the significant difference in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> is meaningful. In addition, if the 3 min training during the sleep phase weakened memory consolidation, the proper comparison would be to animals that have not received the 3 min training, rather than to animals that received the 3 min training with anisomycin."

The lack of effect of diphtheria toxin, puromycin, and emetine might result from a barrier to permeation of these agents into nerve cells, and it is possible that cycloheximide is unstable in the slightly alkaline seawater. Wilson (47) has reported some inhibition of leucine incorporation into R2 with rather high concentrations of cycloheximide (0.2 mg/ml) and puromycin (1 mg/ml).\""

The effects of emetine are not reversible (e.g., Grollman, A.P. Inhibitors of protein biosynthesis V. Effects of emetine on protein and nucleic acid biosynthesis in HeLa cells. J. Biol. Chem., 1968, 243, 4089-4094.), making emetine a poor choice for our experiments. Rapamycin is not soluble in seawater, and it must therefore be dissolved in DMSO or ethanol before being added to seawater saline. This is a perfectly good procedure, when working with an isolated ganglion, or in culture, but not in the intact animal. In our experience, injecting behaving animals with DMSO turns off feeding. For the experiment reported with the transcription inhibitor DRB, we overcame this problem by dissolving the DRB in ethanol. These were by far the most difficult experiments reported in the paper, since we are working with a fairly large dose of ethanol. We did these experiments with DRB, because we had little choice \u2013 we did not want to use actinomycin because its effects are not reversible, whereas the effects of DRB are reversible. It would be particularly interesting to test the effects of rapamycin, since it is not a general purpose translation inhibitor, but rather only blocks proteins that are downstream from TOR. Is the blocker downstream from TOR? Perhaps not. In any case, this is not a trivially easy experiment to perform. In our estimate, it would take us several months to do this experiment properly."

Moreover, others have used cyclohexamide successfully to block long-term memory in the intact terrestrial snail, Limax (Matsuo et al., 2002) and intact cuttlefish, a cephalopod mollusk (Agin et al., 2003). So, the lack of availability of an alternate protein synthesis inhibitor does not seem an adequate justification for not doing the experiment. The authors are requested to reconsider their stance. The experiment is optional, but if it is not done, then the Discussion should acknowledge the minor possibility of a secondary unknown effect of the one protein-synthesis inhibitor used here.</i>"

We tested the effects of 5 mM cycloheximide in 2 intact animals. Immediately after they were injected, the animals lost contact with the substrate, floating in the seawater, with open parapodia.
