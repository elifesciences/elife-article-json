This process is accompanied by an elevation of sperm intracellular calcium and a membrane hyperpolarization. The latter is evoked by K<sup>+</sup> efflux; however, the molecular identity of the potassium channel of human spermatozoa (hKSper) is unknown. Here, we characterize hKSper, reporting that it is regulated by intracellular calcium but is insensitive to intracellular alkalinization. We also show that human KSper is inhibited by charybdotoxin, iberiotoxin, and paxilline, while mouse KSper is insensitive to these compounds. Such unique properties suggest that the Slo1 ion channel is the molecular determinant for hKSper. We show that Slo1 is localized to the sperm flagellum and is inhibited by progesterone. Inhibition of hKSper by progesterone may depolarize the spermatozoon to open the calcium channel CatSper, thus raising [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] to produce hyperactivation and allowing sperm to fertilize an oocyte."

This process is accompanied by an elevation of sperm intracellular calcium and a membrane hyperpolarization. The latter is evoked by K<sup>+</sup> efflux; however, the molecular identity of the potassium channel of human spermatozoa (hKSper) is unknown. Here, we characterize hKSper, reporting that it is regulated by intracellular calcium but is insensitive to intracellular alkalinization. We also show that human KSper is inhibited by charybdotoxin, iberiotoxin, and paxilline, while mouse KSper is insensitive to these compounds. Such unique properties suggest that the Slo1 ion channel is the molecular determinant for hKSper. We show that Slo1 is localized to the sperm flagellum and is inhibited by progesterone. Inhibition of hKSper by progesterone may depolarize the spermatozoon to open the calcium channel CatSper, thus raising [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] to produce hyperactivation and allowing sperm to fertilize an oocyte."

Instead, they have to undergo a final maturation termed capacitation, during which spermatozoa gain competence to fertilize (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chang, 1951</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Austin, 1952</a>). Early stages of capacitation include the bicarbonate-mediated acceleration of sperm beat frequency and an increase in linear motility (<a href=\"#bib63\">Visconti et al., 1995a</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">1995b</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wennemuth et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wandernoth et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mannowetz et al., 2011</a>).

                        "text": "Potassium channels are indispensable for normal sperm physiology, since they regulate membrane potential and cell motility. Recently, an alkalinization-sensitive sperm K<sup>+</sup> channel, encoded by the <i>kcnu1</i> gene (also known as <i>Slo3</i>), was shown to be essential for male fertility in mice (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schreiber et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Navarro et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Santi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zeng et al., 2011</a>). It has been assumed, but never proven, that the K<sup>+</sup> channel of human sperm has a similar molecular identity. The <i>Slo</i> gene family is represented by <i>Slo1</i>, <i>Slo2</i>, and <i>Slo3</i> (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wei et al., 2005</a>). These channels possess seven transmembrane helices S0\u2013S6, with the S1\u2013S6 helices exhibiting homology to classic voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels. They are tetramers of \u03b1 subunits, with the K<sup>+</sup>-selective pore formed by S5 and S6 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Butler et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Diaz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cui and Aldrich, 2000</a>). In addition, the Slo1 channel contains a large cytosolic C-terminus with two intracellular regulators of K<sup>+</sup> conductance (RCK), both of which contain high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jiang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Yuan et al., 2010</a>). These structural elements give Slo1 channels the ability to sense changes in both voltage and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<a href=\"#bib42\">Marty, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pallotta et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barrett et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Latorre et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Schreiber et al., 1999</a>). Due to their large single-channel conductance of 60\u2013270 pS, Slo1 channels are also known as big potassium (BK) or maxi K channels (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atkinson et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kaczorowski et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Salkoff et al., 2006</a>). Slo3 channels, on the other hand, lack the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl (<a href=\"#bib57\">Schreiber et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Xia et al., 2004</a>), but are sensitive to intracellular alkalinization (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schreiber et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zhang et al., 2006a</a>, <a href=\"#bib81\">2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Navarro et al., 2007</a>). The pore-forming \u03b1 subunits of Slo channels are associated with auxiliary \u03b2- and \u03b3-subunits (<a href=\"#bib8\">Behrens et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brenner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Uebele et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yan and Aldrich, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yang et al., 2011</a>), which interact with the S0 segment of the \u03b1 subunit. Several studies demonstrate that the association with different subunits impacts channel pharmacological and gating properties. In addition, splice variants of the <i>Slo1</i> mRNA contribute to the functional diversity of BK channels (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fodor and Aldrich, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Johnson et al., 2011</a>). Apart from responding to different stimuli, Slo1 and Slo3 channels are distributed discretely within the body as shown in numerous animal studies. Slo1 is detectable in excitable tissues, such as in hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hicks and Marrion, 1998</a>), smooth muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Knaus et al., 1994a</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">1994b</a>) and adrenal chromaffin cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Solaro and Lingle, 1992</a>), whereas Slo3 transcripts are exclusively expressed in male germ cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schreiber et al., 1998</a>). Male Slo1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> animals are able to produce offspring when paired with Slo<sup>+/+</sup> females. However, the litter size was normal only in 10% of the matings (<a href=\"#bib45\">Meredith et al., 2004</a>). Abolishing the Slo3 gene results in more dramatic changes in testicular spermatozoa, such as morphological abnormalities after capacitation, reduced progressive motility, impaired acrosome reaction, and membrane depolarization during capacitation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schreiber et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Santi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zeng et al., 2011</a>). These data indicate that Slo channels are essential for male fertility in mice, which makes them possible candidates for being the major K<sup>+</sup> channel of human sperm."

By applying the patch-clamp technique to ejaculated and epididymal human sperm cells, we found that human K<sup>+</sup> currents are insensitive to intracellular alkalinization but are dependent on intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. We furthermore demonstrate that the human sperm potassium (hKSper) current is inhibited by three known Slo1 channel inhibitors: charybdotoxin (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">MacKinnon and Miller, 1988</a>), iberiotoxin (<a href=\"#bib20\">Galvez et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Candia et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Giangiacomo et al., 1992</a>) and paxilline (<a href=\"#bib30\">Knaus et al., 1994c</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sanchez and McManus, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Zhou et al., 2010</a>), as well as by the micromolar concentrations of progesterone. Taking together our electrophysiological, biochemical, and immunocytochemistry data, we conclude that the Slo1 protein constitutes a major potassium channel of human spermatozoa. Therefore, the molecular identity of human KSper is distinct from that of murine KSper, which is represented by the Slo3 protein."

However, to gain its full activity several events must be met: intracellular alkalinization, presence of progesterone and membrane depolarization (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ren et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kirichok et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lishko and Kirichok, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lishko et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Strunker et al., 2011</a>). Since K<sup>+</sup> channels are involved in the regulation of membrane potential, we hypothesized that the human KSper current (<i>I</i><sub><i>KSper</i></sub>) also originates from the sperm tail to support CatSper activity. To address this question, we recorded from both whole sperm cells and isolated sperm flagella (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). To isolate <i>I</i><sub><i>KSper</i></sub> from <i>I</i><sub><i>CatSper</i></sub>, we recorded K<sup>+</sup> currents in a potassium methanesulfonate-based solution in the presence of 0.1\u20131 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. When divalent cations are absent from the extracellular solution, so called divalent free (DVF) condition, CatSper is able to conduct monovalent ions, such as K<sup>+</sup>. However, in the presence of 0.1\u20131 mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, <i>I</i><sub><i>CatSper</i></sub> is effectively blocked (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kirichok et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lishko et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Smith et al., 2013</a>), thus leading to pure K<sup>+</sup> conductance through K<sup>+</sup> channels. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, K<sup>+</sup> currents elicited under DVF conditions were approximately four times larger than the current recorded in the presence of 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The larger potassium currents (gray bars) represent a mixture of the K<sup>+</sup> efflux through CatSper and KSper while only KSper current remains in the presence of external calcium (red bars). Similar amplitudes of KSper currents recorded from whole sperm cells or sperm flagella indicate that <i>I</i><sub><i>KSper</i></sub> originate primarily from the sperm flagellum, in the same manner as does <i>I</i><sub><i>CatSper</i></sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lishko et al., 2011</a>)."

Recently, recombinant human Slo3 co-expressed with a \u03b3-subunit was also shown to exhibit pH-dependency (<a href=\"#bib33\">Leonetti et al., 2012</a>). However, its pH-sensitivity was shifted toward a more acidic pH range than that of mouse Slo3. Therefore, we decided to test whether human KSper exhibits the same pH sensitivity and recorded K<sup>+</sup> currents from human spermatozoa under conditions when intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) was held either at pH 7.4 or 5.5, and external pH kept at 7.4. To evoke intracellular alkalinization, 10 mM of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl was added to the external (bath) solution, which is a standard technique to effectively and quickly raise an intracellular pH (<a href=\"#bib6\">Babcock et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kirichok et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Navarro et al., 2007</a>).

Note that in DVF conditions, control currents were larger than control KSper currents, due to the efflux of potassium ions through both KSper and CatSper channels.

                                "text": "We and others previously have shown that the sperm-specific calcium channel CatSper is activated by progesterone (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lishko et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Strunker et al., 2011</a>). Progesterone (P) shifts CatSper activation to more physiological, hyperpolarized, membrane potentials (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lishko et al., 2011</a>). To test whether progesterone has any effect onto hKSper, we recorded <i>I</i><sub><i>KSper</i></sub> in the presence of different progesterone concentrations in the bath solution. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,C</a> shows that hKSper outward currents were blocked by progesterone in a dose-dependent manner. We have determined that progesterone\u2019s half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) for hKSper is 7.5 \u00b1 1.3 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Moreover, mouse Slo3 turned out to be insensitive to 10 \u00b5M of progesterone (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), which is above the IC<sub>50</sub> for human KSper. Since potassium channels are well known to regulate the membrane potential (<a href=\"#bib48\">Navarro et al., 2007</a>), it is likely that the inhibition of human KSper by P will produce membrane depolarization and create favorable conditions for opening of CatSper. CatSper activation, in turn, will result in an elevation of intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and trigger hyperactivated motility. To test this hypothesis we selectively blocked human KSper by adding 100 nM ChTX to high saline (HS) bath solution in which sperm cells are usually kept, and recorded any changes in sperm motility. As evident from <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> sperm motility was symmetrical in the absence of the Slo1 inhibitor (ChTX). However, incubation in 100 nM ChTX for 25 min resulted in sperm cells exhibiting an asymmetrical motility pattern similar to hyperactivation (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The normal, symmetrical motility was resumed after a prolonged washout (data not shown)."

Indeed, the \u03b23 subunit of Slo1 was shown to be expressed in testis (<a href=\"#bib62\">Uebele et al., 2000</a>), and we also found transcripts of \u03b23 (<i>kcnmb3</i>) from sperm RNA (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>, right panel). Therefore, a reduced sensitivity of human KSper to ChTX (nearly complete inhibition of activity was achieved only with 1 \u03bcM ChTX) is likely due to the presence of the \u03b23 auxiliary subunit in human sperm."

Capacitation is also associated with intracellular alkalinization, which, in turn, has been shown to activate the calcium channel CatSper in human spermatozoa and the potassium channel KSper in murine sperm (<a href=\"#bib79\">Zeng et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arnoult et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kirichok et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Navarro et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lishko et al., 2011</a>). In mouse sperm, K<sup>+</sup> currents originate mainly from the Slo3 channel, which is alkalinization-activated, calcium-insensitive potassium channel (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schreiber et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zhang et al., 2006a</a>, <a href=\"#bib81\">2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Navarro et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Santi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zeng et al., 2011</a>). The currents we recorded from human sperm, however, show very different properties. According to our data, KSper currents recorded either from human epididymal or ejaculated spermatozoa were alkalization-independent producing the same current amplitudes at pH<sub>i</sub> = 5.5 and 7.4. However, we found that human KSper instead is sensitive to intracellular calcium."

The C-terminus of Slo1 potassium channel possesses RCK domains with high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites (<a href=\"#bib47\">Moss et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Schreiber and Salkoff, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jiang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Yuan et al., 2010</a>). This raises the possibility that Slo1 may represent human KSper. Associated \u03b3- (leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins, LRRCs) and \u03b2-subunits further modulate channel behavior in response to calcium. Subunits \u03b31 (LRRC26), \u03b32 (LRRC52), \u03b33 (LRRC55), and \u03b34 (LRRC38) produce a shift towards more hyperpolarized membrane potentials, even in the absence of intracellular calcium and transcripts for all four subunits are detectable in human testis (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yan and Aldrich, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yang et al., 2011</a>). So far, four \u03b2 subunits (\u03b21\u20134) have been identified and are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Subunits \u03b22\u20134 are mainly expressed in brain and neurons, \u03b23 is also detectable in testis, whereas the \u03b21 subunit is preferentially found in smooth muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Knaus et al., 1994b</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Behrens et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brenner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Uebele et al., 2000</a>). hSlo1 activation time is reduced when the \u03b1 subunit is co-expressed with \u03b23 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brenner et al., 2000</a>). Inward currents with increased concentrations of calcium (10, 60, and 300 \u03bcM) occur when the \u03b1-subunit is expressed alone and are potentiated in the presence of subunit \u03b21 and \u03b23 (<a href=\"#bib71a\">Xia et al., 2000</a>). Keeping the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> = 10 \u03bcM, an inward current becomes apparent when Slo1 \u03b1 is co-expressed with \u03b21 and \u03b24, whereas \u03b22 and \u03b23 show no effect (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brenner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lippiat et al., 2003</a>). These data can be explained by the presence of \u03b23 splice variants (\u03b23a\u2013d) arising from four different exons with each of them encoding for an alternative N terminus (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zeng et al., 2008</a>). One study so far showed that \u03b23b, \u03b23c, and \u03b23d transcripts are present in human testis, with \u03b23d showing the greatest expression (<a href=\"#bib62\">Uebele et al., 2000</a>). It is possible that <i>I</i><sub><i>KSper</i></sub> of human spermatozoa originates from Slo1 \u03b1-subunits, which are in the complex with \u03b3, \u03b2, or even both auxiliary subunits. Indeed, according to our data, \u03b23 transcripts are present in the RNA pool isolated from mature ejaculated human sperm cells. Moreover, our data show that elevated intracellular calcium strongly potentiates outward current and results in the appearance of an inward current. These hKSper properties (calcium sensitivity and pH-insensitivity) favor the idea that Slo1 represents the potassium channel in human spermatozoa."

However, there is evidence that all four \u03b2-subunits can confer resistance to these toxins. It has been reported that IbTX effectively blocks recombinant hSlo\u03b1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 33 nM, but IbTX inhibition of recombinant hSlo\u03b1 in a complex with \u03b21 raises IC<sub>50</sub> to 371 nM (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lippiat et al., 2003</a>). Also, subunit \u03b22 greatly reduces the sensitivity of the \u03b1 subunit to ChTX (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1 nM vs 58 nM) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wallner et al., 1999</a>). Another study revealed that 20 nM ChTX was sufficient to block recombinant hSlo\u03b1, whereas 100 nM of toxin was required to inhibit hSlo\u03b1 + \u03b21. Moreover, even 100 nM of ChTX was insufficient to effectively block hSlo\u03b1 + \u03b23 (<a href=\"#bib71\">Xia et al., 1999</a>). Furthermore, slower blocking kinetics for ChTX and IbTX have been shown in hSlo\u03b1 + \u03b24 constructs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Meera et al., 2000</a>). Northern blot analyses demonstrate that mRNA for subunits \u03b23 and \u03b24 is detectable in human testis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brenner et al., 2000</a>), and it has been shown that the resistance to IbTX and ChTX is determined by the large extracellular loop of the \u03b24 subunit (<a href=\"#bib43\">Meera et al., 2000</a>). Since we observed different blocking kinetics with ChTX (93% reduction with 1 \u03bcM ChTX) and IbTX (87% reduction with 100 nM IbTX), it seems likely that in human sperm, the Slo1 channel is associated with \u03b2 subunits that modulate channel behavior in response to these toxins."

Interestingly, Slo3 is paxilline insensitive, and recently it has been demonstrated that paxilline binds to a glycine residue at position 311 within the S6 segment of the \u03b1-subunit (<a href=\"#bib82\">Zhou et al., 2010</a>). This effect is independent of auxiliary subunits. However, the same study elucidated other factors within the Slo channel structure, which seem to be important for paxilline block. First, the turret region could determine the effectiveness of paxilline block. The turret is the extracellular loop between S5 and the pore domain, which contains more residues in Slo channels as compared to other K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carvacho et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Giangiacomo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Latorre et al., 2010</a>). Replacing the first half of the mSlo1 pore loop with the corresponding mSlo3 sequence leads to a five times greater paxilline inhibition and increases inhibition and washout rates (<a href=\"#bib82\">Zhou et al., 2010</a>). A second source for altered abilities of paxilline inhibition is the pore loop region in the S6 segment, which differs in 10 residues between Slo1 and Slo3. When we applied 100 nM paxilline to human spermatozoa, only 62% of hKSper reduction was observed, whereas even a fivefold higher concentration did not affect currents recorded from mouse sperm. From these data, we conclude that in human spermatozoa, either the turret region or the S6 segment of BK channels show properties that do not allow a complete block of the K<sup>+</sup> currents by paxilline."

Human KSper is a pH-independent, calcium-sensitive potassium channel sensitive to selective Slo1 inhibitors, such as charybdotoxin, iberiotoxin and paxilline, and is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of progesterone. Apart from its localization in sperm flagella, mouse KSper lacks all earlier-mentioned properties. Taken together, these results indicate that the human sperm potassium channel comprises the Slo1 protein and not Slo3. In addition, we propose the following model: the functional proximity of KSper to other sperm ion channels helps temporally coordinate their actions in a concerted manner during capacitation (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). In the uterus and the Fallopian tube, intracellular alkalinization is evoked by Hv1, thus activating CatSper channels. However, CatSper will not be fully active, as hKSper channels function as feedback regulators in response to calcium influx, thus retaining the membrane potential in a hyperpolarized state. In close proximity to the oocyte however, sperm encounter high concentrations of progesterone, which, in turn, will block hKSper, leading to membrane depolarization opening CatSper channels, which will become fully potentiated by the presence of progesterone. These events will lead to elevated levels of intracellular calcium in sperm, thereby initiating calcium-dependent processes such as hyperactivity and the acrosome reaction making the fertilization event possible."

This is achieved by the inhibition of sperm KSper, the channel responsible for membrane hyperpolarization. In close proximity to the oocyte, spermatozoa encounter micromolar concentrations of P, which inhibit hKSper, resulting in membrane depolarization.

Pipettes (13\u201316 M\u03a9) were filled with 130 mM KMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 20 mM HEPES, 4 mM KCl, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, and pH 7.4 was adjusted with KOH, 330 mOsm/l. In the experiments with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, pipette solutions were of similar composition, but contained just 5 mM HEPES to allow efficient intracellular pH changes. The nominal free bath solution (NMF) consisted of (in mM) 140 KMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 20 HEPES, and pH 7.4 was adjusted with KOH, 320 mOsm/l. To inhibit monovalent currents through CatSper channels (<a href=\"#bib58\">Smith et al., 2013</a>), 0.1\u20131 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added to the NMF solution, as indicated. To elicit potassium currents through CatSper, currents were recorded in a K<sup>+</sup>-based divalent free bath solution (K-DVF) containing (in mM) 140 KMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 45 HEPES, 1 EDTA, 7.4 adjusted with KOH, 320 mOsm/l. Inside (pipette) solutions with different concentrations of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> contained (in mM) 130 KMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 20 HEPES, 4 KCl and 1 BAPTA, 1 EDTA, 1 EGTA (for 100 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>) or 1 HEDTA (for 50 \u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup>), respectively. CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added according to WinMAXC32 version 2.51 (Chris Patton, Stanford University). Since changing of the pipette solution cannot be easily done on one cell, the data obtained with different intracellular pH or different intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] are a combination of recordings from multiple cells. However, since the changing of bath solution can be easily accomplished on the same cell, the experiments with different bath solutions (addition of EDTA, extracellular calcium, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, ChTX, IbTX, Paxilline, progesterone, etc) were performed on the same sperm cell (flagellum): before and after addition of the above-mentioned compound. Data were analyzed with Clampfit 10.3 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and OriginPro 8.6 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA, USA). Statistical data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM), and n indicates number of experiments. All electrophysiology experiments were performed at 24\u00b0C."

In mouse sperm, it has been redundantly shown that the major K<sup>+</sup> channel (mKsper) is formed by the pH-sensitive mSlo3 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Navarro et al. (2007)</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zeng et al. (2011)</a>). Using whole cell patch recording from human sperm and various channel inhibitors, the authors surprise us with the finding that the major K<sup>+</sup> conductance in human sperm is not formed by Slo3 but is likely formed by Slo1, a K<sup>+</sup> channel with biophysical properties and regulation quite different from those of Slo3."

This happens because in DVF conditions most of the potassium efflux is carried out by pH-sensitive CatSper channel. The fact that K<sup>+</sup> efflux is strongly up-regulated upon addition of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl in DVF, indicates that intracellular alkalinization has been achieved, and CatSper was potentiated (as it should).

The closer examination of the tail currents revealed that we are dealing with a similar problem as with measurements of activation time constants. The closing of human KSper produced fast tail currents, especially fast in the presence of intracellular calcium. Such tail currents significantly overlapped with capacitance artifacts (the duration of an artifact was \u223c10 ms, while tail currents were essentially irresolvable after 8 ms). Therefore, we decided to remove the G/V curve data from the manuscript."

However, the fact that the current densities are still larger (in fact, twice larger) in mouse sperm points to the potential differences in KSper expression. We have discussed this in the revised manuscript. In addition, recording from mouse spermatozoa were done under conditions where Slo3 is fully activated (pH= 7.4), while recording from human sperm was done at 0 intracellular calcium. The latter creates conditions for only partial Slo1 activation (human KSper in the presence of micromolar intracellular calcium are twice larger than in the absence). Another physiological explanation could be that mouse CatSper is operational under more negative membrane potentials (Vm) than human CatSper: V1/2 of human CatSper is +30mV (pH 7.5, +progesterone), while V1/2 of mouse CatSper is -11mV (pH 7.5, progesterone insensitive). Higher KSper expression in human sperm cells would further hyperpolarize the membrane essentially making it impossible for human CatSper to function. This does not apply to the mouse CatSper, however, as it is functional in more hyperpolarized conditions."
