This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u2018Coadministration of a tumor-penetrating peptide enhances the efficacy of cancer drugs\u2019 by Sugahara and colleagues, published in <i>Science</i> in 2010 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Sugahara et al., 2010</a>). The key experiments being replicated include Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 9A. In Figure 2, Sugahara and colleagues presented data on the tumor penetrance of doxorubicin (DOX) when co-administered with the peptide iRGD, as well as the effect of co-treatment of DOX and iRGD on tumor weight and cell death. In Supplemental Figure 9A, they tracked body weight of mice treated with DOX and iRGD to provide evidence that iRGD does not increase known DOX toxicity. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a>, and the results of the replications will be published by <i>eLife</i>."

This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u2018Coadministration of a tumor-penetrating peptide enhances the efficacy of cancer drugs\u2019 by Sugahara and colleagues, published in <i>Science</i> in 2010 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Sugahara et al., 2010</a>). The key experiments being replicated include Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 9A. In Figure 2, Sugahara and colleagues presented data on the tumor penetrance of doxorubicin (DOX) when co-administered with the peptide iRGD, as well as the effect of co-treatment of DOX and iRGD on tumor weight and cell death. In Supplemental Figure 9A, they tracked body weight of mice treated with DOX and iRGD to provide evidence that iRGD does not increase known DOX toxicity. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a>, and the results of the replications will be published by <i>eLife</i>."

This family of small peptides has been widely shown to promote targeting of a variety of therapeutics to tumor blood vessels (for review see <a href=\"#bib3\">Danhier et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Feron, 2010</a>). Sugahara and colleagues previously presented data showing that a novel cyclized form of this peptide, iRGD, coupled to a motif that binds to the Neuropilin-1 receptor, helped increase tissue penetrance beyond the vasculature of anti-cancer drugs when it was directly conjugated to those chemotherapies (<a href=\"#bib9\">Sugahara et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Feron, 2010</a>). In their 2010 study, they showed that iRGD can increase penetrance simply through co-administration with therapies, including peptide-based therapeutics, small molecule drug compounds, and nanoparticle-based therapeutics. This replication attempt will focus on the finding that iRGD co-treatment with doxorubicin (DOX) in orthotopic xenograft prostate tumors increased drug penetrance and accumulation, increased TUNEL staining for apoptotic cells, and decreased tumor volume and weight."

They documented little change in DOX penetrance in non-prostate tissues of the mouse. This figure is evidence of the first key point for replication: that iRGD increases tissue penetrance of the co-injected drug. This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 3."

They showed that treatment with 1 mg/kg DOX with iRGD caused a decrease in tumor weight similar to treatment with 3 mg/kg DOX alone. Addition of iRGD to 3 mg/kg DOX further decreased tumor weight. In Supplemental Figure 9A, they also showed that the overall body weight of mice treated with DOX and iRGD did not change as compared to mice treated with DOX alone, indicating that DOX-related weight gain was not exacerbated by the addition of iRGD. These experiments will be replicated in Protocol 4."

Relative tumor volume in two pancreatic cancer cell line-derived xenografts treated with gemcitabine in combination with iRGD was significantly reduced when compared to tumor volume from xenografts treated with gemcitabine alone. Additionally, Akashi and colleagues assessed compound penetration by co-administering iRDG and the dye Evans Blue. They showed that Evans Blue dye penetrated further into tumor tissue when co-administered with iRGD than alone (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akashi et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, Gu and colleagues showed that co-administration of iRGD with encapsulated paclitaxel increased nanoparticle extravasation across the blood\u2013brain barrier, and co-administration of paclitaxel nanoparticles and iRGD led to an increase in mean survival of mice carrying intracranial gliomas (<a href=\"#bib6\">Gu et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, Pang and colleagues extended the work done in Sugahara and colleagues' 2010 paper by showing that binding of iRDG through an additional cysteine residue to plasma albumin prolonged the half-life of iRGD and increased tumor penetrance (<a href=\"#bib7\">Pang et al., 2014</a>). In 2011, Ruoslahti and colleagues extended their findings to show that iRDG was also effective in increasing tumor penetrance of a novel therapeutic consisting of a nanoparticle-encapsulated peptide that homed to tumor vasculature and disrupted mitochondrial membranes, causing cell death; this co-treatment increased the survival of mice bearing glioblastomas as compared to mice treated with the nanoparticle alone (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agemy et al., 2011</a>)."

The iRGD peptide (H-Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-Lys-Gly-Pro-Asp-Cys-NH2) will be chemically synthesized using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxy carbonyl) chemistry sequence. The fully synthesized crude peptide will be cleaved from the resin and cleaned with Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The crude peptides will be then diethyl ether precipitated, drained, and washed. The peptides will then be amide blocked on the C terminus and cyclized by a disulfide bridge between C1 and C9. The peptides will be isolated and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Fractions of greater than 95% purity will be used for the investigation. The purity and molecular weight of the peptide will be confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-time of flight mass spectrometry. Exact synthesis specifications were not originally specified; the lab will follow standard procedures for synthesis."

Additionally, any known difference from the original experiments and replication experiments are detailed and whether any of these might impact the replication. This also includes valuable insight from the authors of the originally reported results. Additionally, all data collected during the experimental procedure will be recorded and made publically available to allow the collective experimental results to be evaluated. This project aims to evaluate the predictors of reproducing a subset of the published literature. Thus, the focus is on a collection of experimental outcomes, and the factors associated with them, and not the conclusions from any given paper, which are based on multiple experiments and models. Additionally, a failure to replicate does not mean the original result was a false positive, just like an ability to replicate the original result does not mean the original interpretation is correct."
