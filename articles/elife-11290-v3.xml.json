Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been associated with juvenile experience-dependent primary visual cortex (V1) plasticity, yet little is known about their role in this process in the adult V1. Activation of MMPs is a crucial step facilitating structural changes in a healthy brain; however, upon brain injury, upregulated MMPs promote the spread of a lesion and impair recovery. To clarify these seemingly opposing outcomes of MMP-activation, we examined the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stoke-affected adult mice. In healthy animals, 7-day application of MMP-inhibitor prevented visual plasticity. Additionally, treatment with MMP-inhibitor once but not twice following stroke rescued plasticity, normally lost under these conditions. Our data imply that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur."

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been associated with juvenile experience-dependent primary visual cortex (V1) plasticity, yet little is known about their role in this process in the adult V1. Activation of MMPs is a crucial step facilitating structural changes in a healthy brain; however, upon brain injury, upregulated MMPs promote the spread of a lesion and impair recovery. To clarify these seemingly opposing outcomes of MMP-activation, we examined the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stoke-affected adult mice. In healthy animals, 7-day application of MMP-inhibitor prevented visual plasticity. Additionally, treatment with MMP-inhibitor once but not twice following stroke rescued plasticity, normally lost under these conditions. Our data imply that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur."

In young rodents, taping one eye shut for a few days causes inputs from that eye to visual areas of the brain to become weaker. Inputs from the open eye meanwhile become stronger, leading to improved vision in the open eye. Such plasticity also occurs in adult rodents, but the eye must be closed for longer to produce an effect."

In the clinical setting, plasticity is important for tissue repair and neural network rewiring, necessary for recovery and optimal post-injury brain function. The primary visual cortex (V1) is a widely used model region for studying sensory plasticity in young vs. adult brains (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hofer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Espinosa and Stryker, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Levelt and H\u00fcbener, 2012</a>). In mammals, V1 consists of a monocular and a binocular zone; neurons in the binocular zone respond to stimulation of both eyes but are dominated by the contralateral eye in rodents (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dr\u00e4ger, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">1978</a>). This ocular dominance (OD) can be modified in an experience-dependent manner, by depriving one eye of pattern vision for several days (known as monocular deprivation or MD), as originally observed by Wiesel and Hubel more than 50 years ago (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wiesel and Hubel, 1965</a>). OD-plasticity has become one of the major paradigms for studying cortical plasticity. In standard-cage raised mice, OD-plasticity in binocular V1 is most pronounced in 4-week-old animals; reduced, yet present, in early adulthood; and absent in animals older than 110 days of age (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lehmann and L\u00f6wel, 2008</a>). In 4-week-old mice, 3-4 days of MD are sufficient to induce a significant OD-shift towards the open eye (juvenile OD-plasticity), while 7 days of MD are needed in 3-month-old animals (adult OD-plasticity) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sawtell et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Frenkel and Bear, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mrsic-Flogel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sato and Stryker, 2008</a>). Although the experimental paradigm is rather similar, molecular mechanisms underlying 'juvenile' and 'adult' OD-plasticity are different: in juvenile mice, OD-shifts are mostly mediated by reductions in deprived eye responses while adult plasticity is predominantly mediated by an increase in open eye responses in V1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hofer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Espinosa and Stryker, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Levelt and H\u00fcbener, 2012</a>)."

Structural and molecular composition of the ECM changes during development, becoming denser and more rigid in the mature brain (<a href=\"#bib17\">Frischknecht and Gundelfinger, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">de Vivo et al., 2013</a>). This structural composition is partially regulated by a family of zinc dependent endopeptidases, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and their enzymatic activity is crucial for proper development, function and maintenance of neuronal networks (<a href=\"#bib39\">Milward et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huntley, 2012</a>). A recent study in juvenile rats showed that pharmacological inhibition of MMPs with a broad spectrum inhibitor during the MD-period did not influence the reduction of the closed-eye responses induced by 3 days of MD, yet it prevented the potentiation of the nondeprived eye responses in V1 after 7 days of MD (<a href=\"#bib59\">Spolidoro et al., 2012</a>).

In addition, a single treatment after the S1-stroke rescued plasticity in both paradigms, whereas treatment with the inhibitor two times diminished plasticity-promoting effect.

While the experience-induced improvements in the spatial frequency and contrast thresholds of the optomotor reflex of the open eye after MD are cortex-dependent (<a href=\"#bib46\">Prusky et al., 2006</a>), the mechanism underlying these enhancements is not yet fully understood. Using the virtual-reality optomotor setup (<a href=\"#bib45\">Prusky et al., 2004</a>) and daily testing, we examined the role of MMPs in this kind of interocular plasticity. Spatial frequency and contrast sensitivity thresholds of the optomotor reflex were measured in both vehicle-treated (control) and GM6001-treated mice before and during the 7-day MD-period. Mice without MD did not show any experience-induced changes in the spatial frequency (n=6, day 0: 0.37 \u00b1 0.002 cyc/deg vs. day 7: 0.37 \u00b1 0.001 cyc/deg, t-test, p&gt;0.05, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) or contrast sensitivity thresholds of the optomotor reflex (day 0 vs. day 7, for all spatial frequencies, ANOVA, p&gt;0.05, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In contrast, vehicle-treated (control) mice with 7 days of MD showed the typical enhancements of both the spatial frequency and contrast thresholds of the optomotor reflex: the spatial frequency threshold of the open eye increased on average by 22 \u00b1 1% from day 0 to day 7 (day 0/7: 0.37 \u00b1 0.002/0.46 \u00b1 0.0001 cyc/deg, n=5, t-test, p&lt;0.001, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and was thus significantly different from control mice without MD (n=6) that displayed no experience-driven changes (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Likewise, contrast sensitivity of the open eye of control mice increased after MD (for all spatial frequencies, ANOVA, p&lt;0.001, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), and was different on day 7 compared to control mice without MD (control, n=5 vs. control+MD, n=5, t-test, p&lt;0.001, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In contrast, in GM6001-treated mice MD did neither induce an improvement of the spatial frequency (day 0/day 7: 0.37 \u00b1 0.002/0.38 \u00b1 0.002 cyc/deg, n=5, t-test, p&gt;0.05 <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), nor of contrast sensitivity thresholds of the optomotor reflex of the open eye (at all spatial frequencies, ANOVA, p&gt;0.05, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Treatment in the no MD groups\u00a0(control, GM6001) had no effect on baseline spatial frequency and contrast thresholds (for all measurements, ANOVA, p&gt;0.05, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), demonstrating that MMP-inhibition did not affect the ability to exhibit the optomotor reflex but prevented the experience-enabled changes induced by MD. Together, our behavioral vision tests indicate an essential role for MMPs in this cortex-dependent interocular plasticity paradigm: MMP-inhibition completely abolished the experience-enabled improvements of the optomotor reflex of the open eye."

In contrast to vehicle-treated, PT-lesioned\u00a0mice receiving a single or two-times injections of the MMP-inhibitor (PT+MD+GM6001) displayed the typical experience-enabled enhancements in the spatial frequency threshold of the optomotor reflex of the open eye after MD: values increased from 0.38 \u00b1 0.002 on day 0 to 0.45 \u00b1 0.003 on day 7 after MD (n=14, t-test, p&lt;0.001).

A combination of <i>in vivo</i> optical imaging and behavioral vision tests revealed that an optimal level of MMP-activity is essential for adult visual plasticity to occur in the healthy <i>and</i> stroke-affected brain. In healthy adult mice, MMP-inhibition with GM6001 prevented both ocular dominance plasticity and experience-driven improvements of the optomotor reflex of the open eye after MD, indicating that MMP-activation is required for normal adult plasticity. In addition, blockade of elevated MMP-activity after a cortical stroke rescued compromised plasticity. Specifically, a single but not two-times treatment with GM6001 after a cortical PT-lesion in the neighboring S1 region fully rescued experience-dependent ocular dominance plasticity in adult V1, which is normally lost under these conditions. These observations suggest that MMP-activity has to be within a narrow window to allow visual plasticity: if MMP-activity is downregulated (with inhibitors) or upregulated (after stroke) experience-induced plastic changes are compromised."

                        "text": "In a healthy brain, the enzymatic activity of MMPs has plasticity promoting effects (<a href=\"#bib39\">Milward et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huntley, 2012</a>). Consequently to increased neuronal activity, activated MMPs can lessen physical barriers (loosen up the ECM) or via the degradation of certain receptors influence signaling pathways. Such changes within neuronal cells and their synapses thereby alter the structure and activity of neuronal networks (<a href=\"#bib39\">Milward et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huntley, 2012</a>). Involvement of MMPs in synaptic circuit remodeling has been mainly studied in the hippocampus, yet, their abundant expression in the central nervous system (CNS) indicates a much broader function. For instance, MMP9-deficient mice showed modestly reduced experience-dependent plasticity in the barrel cortex (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kaliszewska et al., 2012</a>) and MMP3-deficient mice displayed abnormal neuronal morphology in the visual cortex and impaired plasticity induced by long-term monocular enucleation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aerts et al., 2014</a>). Here, we used a different approach to probe the role of MMPs in experience-induced changes in the visual system: we performed the experiments in wild type mice and treated them with the broad-spectrum inhibitor GM6001 or vehicle during 7 days of MD. Consistent with previous findings (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sawtell et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sato and Stryker, 2008</a>), the OD-shift of vehicle-treated mice was mediated by open-eye potentiation. In contrast, there was no change in the open nor in the closed eye responses and hence no OD-plasticity in V1 after MD in GM6001-treated adult mice. This is in line with recent observations from juvenile rats, in which chronic treatment with GM6001 also prevented open eye potentiation after 7 days of MD (<a href=\"#bib59\">Spolidoro et al., 2012</a>). However, treatment in this study only partially prevented the OD-shift, as there was no effect on the reduction of deprived eye responses (<a href=\"#bib59\">Spolidoro et al., 2012</a>). A reduction in deprived eye responses in V1 is mostly observed in juvenile rodents after 3-4 days of MD (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</a>), unless different raising conditions are used such as enriched environment or running wheel (<a href=\"#bib21\">Greifzu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kalogeraki et al., 2014</a>). In adult, standard-cage raised mice, 6-7 days of MD are necessary for significant OD-shifts and changes are mainly mediated by increases of open eye responses in V1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sawtell et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sato and Stryker, 2008</a>). MMP9 activity was suggested in the potentiation of the open eye responses in juvenile rats, as treatment with GM6001 significantly reduced MMP9-mRNA expression only in the hemisphere where structural changes took place (<a href=\"#bib59\">Spolidoro et al., 2012</a>). Since we observed a full blockade of plasticity after GM6001-treatment, it would be of interest to determine whether MMP9 is crucial for open-eye potentiation also in the adult brain. MMP9 has been widely investigated in various plasticity paradigms (<a href=\"#bib39\">Milward et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Frischknecht and Gundelfinger, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huntley, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tsilibary et al., 2014</a>) and one of the molecules shown to stimulate MMP9 secretion and expression <i>in vitro and in vivo</i> is Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFalpha) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hanemaaijer et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Candelario-Jalil et al., 2007</a>). TNFalpha signaling was found to play an important role in the open eye potentiation in juvenile\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Kaneko, et al., 2008</a>), but not in adult V1 plasticity (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ranson et al., 2012</a>), and since our data reveal that MMPs are indispensable for adult V1 plasticity, MMP-activation in the adult brain is most likely not dependent on TNFalpha signaling. Accordingly, this adds to the notion that juvenile and adult V1 plasticity depend on different molecular mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hofer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sato and Stryker, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ranson et al., 2012</a>). Together, our new data demonstrate a vital role of MMPs for adult visual cortex plasticity, in particular for the increase of open eye responses in V1 after MD, and notably expand the previous studies from juvenile rats."

Under pathophysiological conditions like inflammation, infection or stroke, uncontrolled MMP driven proteolysis can lead to negative consequences (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rosenberg et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rosenberg, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agrawal et al., 2008</a>). Excessive MMP-activity after stroke caused blood brain barrier disruption, upregulation of inflammatory mediators, excitotoxicity and eventually cell death\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib50\">Romanic et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lo et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wang and Tsirka, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yong, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Morancho et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Vandenbroucke and Libert, 2014</a>). Recent studies reported increased enzymatic MMP9 activity within 24 h after a PT-stroke, and application of a broad spectrum MMP-inhibitor (FN-439) applied <i>at the time</i> of stroke induction, partially rescued impaired barrel cortex plasticity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cybulska-Klosowicz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liguz-Lecznar et al., 2012</a>). Here we tested whether inhibition of upregulated MMP-activity (resulting from PT-stroke) may rescue cortical plasticity also when the treatment starts <i>after</i> lesion induction. Indeed, a single GM6001-treatment after PT in the neighboring S1 fully rescued plasticity in both of our experimental paradigms, OD- and interocular plasticity. Importantly, successful treatment did not have to start immediately after stroke induction (1\u00a0h) because treatment 24\u00a0h after had the same beneficial effect, highlighting the therapeutic potential of brief MMP-inhibition for stroke recovery. Beneficial treatment was, however, dependent on the number of injections: a single but not two-times injection of the MMP-inhibitor rescued OD-plasticity. The reduced plasticity-promoting effect in V1 of mice treated twice with GM6001 is likely due to <i>too</i> excessive MMP-downregulation, which in turn interfered with MMP facilitation of MD-induced plasticity. Consistent with this interpretation, it was reported that a particular dosage, timing as well as duration of MMPs-inhibition mattered for reduciton of lesion sizes after intracerebral hemorrhage, blood brain barrier permability or neurovascular remodeling in post-stroke period (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wang and Tsirka, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhao et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sood et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2014</a>). Together with the results from healthy animals, our data suggest that the plasticity-promoting effects of MMPs are dependent on a well-balanced level of activation, and if that balance is disturbed, experience-induced plastic changes are compromised."

Stroke influences brain function in numerous ways e.g., causing inflammation and apoptosis, or disrupting the tightly regulated balance of neuronal inhibition and excitation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Neumann-Haefelin et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schiene et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Witte and Stoll, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Que et al., 1999a</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">1999b</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Witte et al., 2000</a>) also in perilesional areas (<a href=\"#bib42\">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</a>). One of the major consequences of ischemic damage is an elevated level of the neurotransmitter glutamate, leading to excitotoxicity and neuronal death (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lai et al., 2014</a>). On the other hand, stroke can lead to increased tonic inhibition in the peri-infarct zone, and reducing this inhibition can promote functional recovery (<a href=\"#bib9\">Clarkson et al., 2010</a>). In addition, focal ischemia can induce spreading depression within ipsilateral cortex (<a href=\"#bib57\">Schroeter et al., 1995</a>) and a recent study showed that this phenomenon upregulated MMPs, leading to a breakdown of the blood brain barrier, edema, and vascular leakage, which was suppressed by GM6001 treatment (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gursoy-Ozdemir et al., 2004</a>). Thus, it is likely that treatment with GM6001 shortly after the stroke (as in the present study) downregulated MMPs, thus reduced spreading depression, improved disturbed excitation/inhibition balance and allowed plastic changes to occur."

The present results, together with the above mentioned study, are not easy to reconcile with findings where MMP-inhibitors reduced the volume of a brain injury (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wang and Tsirka, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Vandenbroucke and Libert, 2014</a>).

The optomotor reflex is known to be mediated by subcortical pathways\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Giolli et al., 2006</a>). While visual capabilities measured by optomotry mainly reflect the properties of the retinal ganglion cells that project to these subcortical structures (<a href=\"#bib12\">Douglas et al., 2005</a>), daily testing in the optomotor setup after MD induces a cortex-dependent and experience-enabled enhancement of spatial vision through the open eye (<a href=\"#bib46\">Prusky et al., 2006</a>). Although inflammation was shown to interfere with the experience-enabled optomotor changes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Greifzu et al., 2011</a>), little is known about the cellular origins or signaling pathways responsible for this plasticity paradigm. Here, we found that daily application of the MMP-inhibitor during MD prevented enhancements in both the spatial frequency and contrast sensitivity thresholds of the optomotor reflex of the open eye, while vehicle-treated control mice displayed the typical experience-enabled optomotor improvements. On the other hand, treatment of mice with the same inhibitor once or twice following cortical stroke rescued the impaired optomotor improvements. Thus, in contrast to the OD-plasticity results, rescue of optomotor improvements was present regardless of the duration of the treatment, adding to the idea that separate mechanisms and different neuronal circuits are responsible for OD- and interocular plasticity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Greifzu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kang et al., 2013</a>).

Lidocaine (2% xylocain jelly) was applied locally to all incisions. The body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C and heart rate was monitored throughout the experiment via attached electrocardiograph leads. An incision of the skin was made over the visual cortex and low-melting point agarose (2.5% in 0.9% NaCl) and a glass coverslip were placed over the exposed area."

Using a 135\u00a0mm\u00d750\u00a0mm (imaging of one hemisphere) or 50\u00a0mm\u00d750\u00a0mm (simultaneous imaging of both hemispheres) tandem lens configuration (Nikon, Inc., Melville, NY) a cortical area of 2.67x2.67\u00a0mm<sup>2</sup> or 3.6x3.6 mm<sup>2</sup> and was imaged, respectively.

After acquisition of a surface image, the camera was focused 600 \u03bcm below the cortical surface.

While the phase component of the signal is used for the calculation of retinotopy, the amplitude component represents the intensity of neuronal activation (expressed as fractional change in reflectance \u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>) and was used to calculate OD. For that, the ipsilateral eye magnitude map was first smoothed to reduce pixel shot noise by low-pass filtering using a uniform kernel of 5x5 pixels, and then thresholded at 30% of peak response amplitude to eliminate the background noise. Then an OD-index (ODI) for every pixel in this region was calculated as: (C\u2212I)/(C+I), with C and I representing the response magnitudes of each pixel to visual stimulation of the contralateral and ipsilateral eye, respectively (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cang et al., 2005a</a>). The ODI ranges from \u22121 to +1, with negative values representing ipsilateral and positive values representing contralateral dominance. We then computed an ODI as the average of the OD-scores of all responsive pixels (all pixels with response amplitude above 30% of peak response). Consequently, we calculated ODIs from blocks of 4 runs in which the averaged maps for each eye had at least a response magnitude of 1\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>. All ODIs of one animal (typically 3\u20135) were averaged for further quantification and data display. In the polar maps, hue encodes visual field position (retinotopy) and lightness encodes the magnitude of the visual responses. The quality of the retinotopic maps was assessed by the calculation described by <a href=\"#bib5\">Cang et al. (2005b)</a> on contralateral eye. We selected the most responsive area (in the number of 20,000 pixels) within V1 by thresholding at 30% of peak response amplitude of the activity map. For each of the pixels within this area the difference between its visual field position and the mean position of its surrounding 24 pixels was calculated. For maps of high quality, the position differences are quite small because of smooth progression. The standard deviation of the position difference was then used as an index of the quality of retinotopic maps with small values indicating high map quality and vice versa."

Previous evidence regarding the roles of MMPs and inflammation in the regulation of CNS plasticity has been confusing, at best, with some studies showing positive and others showing negative effects. The study reports on a series of experiments on the visual cortex of adult mice to show that blockade of MMPs prevents an important form of adult neural plasticity in otherwise intact animals, but that transient blockade of the apparently excessive MMP activity produced by an experimental stroke restores normal adult levels of plasticity in surrounding intact cortex. In other words, inhibiting MMPs prevents plasticity in healthy mice and promotes plasticity in lesioned mice."

It is not clear at all that the results show \"diverging roles\" (as stated in the title) for the stroke and healthy situation. Rather than 'opposite' the two effects are likely to be two sides of the same coin \u2013 it appears the MMPs have to be within a narrow window, i.e. be at just at the right level: if they go down (with inhibitors) or up (after stroke) then there is no plasticity. Recasting the paper in this direction (and making it clear that MMPs are elevated by stroke, which is now implied but barely stated), would make the paper much clearer. So it would be best to change the main message of the paper and focus on the narrow window for plasticity imposed by MMPs."

In the healthy mice, the inhibitor is applied for the seven days of MD, in the lesioned mice; it is applied once an hour after lesioning, or twice after lesioning, in which case the plasticity is blocked. The paper says that the two effects in healthy and lesioned mice are opposite. To make this conclusion, the paper would need to examine the OD plasticity in healthy mice with a single injection of the MMP inhibitor one hour after deprivation. It is unclear if plasticity would be blocked or enhanced in this case. For a proper comparison, one should also inject the lesioned mice daily for seven days \u2013 to match the healthy mouse experiment \u2013 although it is likely that the plasticity would be gone, given that a second injection after 24 hours prevents plasticity. This would point to the fact that there are not necessarily differential effects in lesioned and healthy mice. Different time courses or doses of inhibitor action might give different results. As a consequence, as stated in point 1, it is not clear that the results show these two scenarios to be opposite. They are likely different versions of the same plasticity (dependent on the timing), which is in direct contrast to the conclusions currently made in the manuscript."

The Discussion should speculate on why one inhibitor treatment enhances plasticity and more than one treatment prevents it. It seems that once again this result points to the need for MMPs to be in a narrow window."

It is not clear at all that the results show \"diverging roles\" (as stated in the title) for the stroke and healthy situation. Rather than 'opposite' the two effects are likely to be two sides of the same coin \u2013 it appears the MMPs have to be within a narrow window, i.e. be at just at the right level: if they go down (with inhibitors) or up (after stroke) then there is no plasticity. Recasting the paper in this direction (and making it clear that MMPs are elevated by stroke, which is now implied but barely stated), would make the paper much clearer. So it would be best to change the main message of the paper and focus on the narrow window for plasticity imposed by MMPs.</i>"

In the healthy mice, the inhibitor is applied for the seven days of MD, in the lesioned mice; it is applied once an hour after lesioning, or twice after lesioning, in which case the plasticity is blocked. The paper says that the two effects in healthy and lesioned mice are opposite. To make this conclusion, the paper would need to examine the OD plasticity in healthy mice with a single injection of the MMP inhibitor one hour after deprivation. It is unclear if plasticity would be blocked or enhanced in this case. For a proper comparison, one should also inject the lesioned mice daily for seven days \u2013 to match the healthy mouse experiment \u2013 although it is likely that the plasticity would be gone, given that a second injection after 24 hours prevents plasticity. This would point to the fact that there are not necessarily differential effects in lesioned and healthy mice. Different time courses or doses of inhibitor action might give different results. As a consequence, as stated in point 1, it is not clear that the results show these two scenarios to be opposite. They are likely different versions of the same plasticity (dependent on the timing), which is in direct contrast to the conclusions currently made in the manuscript.</i>"

Inspired by your suggestion, we performed a set of additional experiments to test if treatments need to be given immediately after stroke to rescue plasticity. To this end, we induced a photothrombotic stroke in S1 (as before) of adult mice, and gave only a single injection of the MMPs-inhibitor 24h after lesion induction. Interestingly, a single injection 24h after PT also rescued plasticity (both ocular dominance- and interocular plasticity) indicating that the lost cortical plasticity after two injections is most likely due to multiple injections and <i>not</i> the timing. Importantly, these results are promising from a translational point of view as treatment did not need to start immediately after stroke induction to have a beneficial effect for rescuing lost visual plasticity.
