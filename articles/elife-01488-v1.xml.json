To elucidate the origin of firing patterns in branched mechanoreceptors, we combined neuroanatomy, electrophysiology and computation to analyze mouse slowly adapting type I (SAI) afferents. These vertebrate touch receptors, which innervate Merkel cells, encode shape and texture. SAI afferents displayed a high degree of variability in touch-evoked firing and peripheral anatomy. The functional consequence of differences in anatomical architecture was tested by constructing network models representing sequential steps of mechanosensory encoding: skin displacement at touch receptors, mechanotransduction and action-potential initiation. A systematic survey of arbor configurations predicted that the arrangement of mechanotransduction sites at heminodes is a key structural feature that accounts in part for an afferent\u2019s firing properties. These findings identify an anatomical correlate and plausible mechanism to explain the driver effect first described by Adrian and Zotterman."

To elucidate the origin of firing patterns in branched mechanoreceptors, we combined neuroanatomy, electrophysiology and computation to analyze mouse slowly adapting type I (SAI) afferents. These vertebrate touch receptors, which innervate Merkel cells, encode shape and texture. SAI afferents displayed a high degree of variability in touch-evoked firing and peripheral anatomy. The functional consequence of differences in anatomical architecture was tested by constructing network models representing sequential steps of mechanosensory encoding: skin displacement at touch receptors, mechanotransduction and action-potential initiation. A systematic survey of arbor configurations predicted that the arrangement of mechanotransduction sites at heminodes is a key structural feature that accounts in part for an afferent\u2019s firing properties. These findings identify an anatomical correlate and plausible mechanism to explain the driver effect first described by Adrian and Zotterman."

In mammals, distinct classes of mechanosensory afferents are tuned to extract specific features of a tactile stimulus and then to encode them as trains of action potentials, or spikes, with unique firing properties (<a href=\"#bib32\">Johnson, 2001</a>). A common feature of mechanosensory neurons is specialized anatomical structures, termed end organs, that shape their neuronal outputs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chalfie, 2009</a>). For example, recent studies show that mouse hair follicles are innervated by at least three molecularly (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2011</a>) and 10 anatomically (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wu et al., 2012</a>) distinct types of cutaneous afferents.

Instead, sensory stimuli act at peripheral terminals to produce receptor potentials, which locally sum to trigger spikes that travel to central terminals up to 1 m away. For myelinated tactile afferents, a landmark study of Pacinian corpuscles established that spikes initiate at the heminode, the most distal node of Ranvier (<a href=\"#bib41\">Loewenstein and Rathkamp, 1958</a>). A Pacinian corpuscle is innervated by an un-branched afferent; however, most tactile end organs comprise branching afferents with multiple sites of sensory transduction."

In the simplest configuration, which is observed in crustacean stretch receptors and frog muscle spindles, receptor potentials from all branches integrate at a single spike initiation zone (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adrian and Zotterman, 1926b</a>). As stimulus intensity increases, additional transduction sites are recruited, producing larger receptor potentials to reach spike threshold. Thus, this configuration results in firing rates proportional to the number of transduction sites recruited. Alternatively, sensory afferents can have multiple spike initiation zones, each driven by inputs from one or a few branches (<a href=\"#bib28\">Horch et al., 1974</a>). Support for this model comes from studies of mammalian muscle spindles and tendon organs, which have multiple myelinated branches and heminodes where spikes might initiate (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fukami, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Quick et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Banks et al., 1997</a>). When a stimulus excites multiple branches, a spike produced by one zone is thought to propagate antidromically into other branches, activating other spike initiation zones and thereby suppressing firing during their refractory period. As a consequence of this resetting mechanism, the spike initiation zone with the highest firing rate is thought to act as a driver for firing in the afferent as a whole. Electrophysiological studies provide strong support for this model (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lindblom and Tapper, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Horch et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fukami, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Peng et al., 1999</a>); however, the structural principles that govern spike initiation and integration in mammalian tactile afferents are unknown."

These mechanoreceptors localize to skin regions specialized for high tactile acuity, including fingertips, whisker follicles and touch domes. SAI afferents represent fine spatial details with high fidelity; therefore, they are thought to encode object features such as edges and curvature (<a href=\"#bib32\">Johnson, 2001</a>). The SAI afferent\u2019s end organ is a cluster of Merkel cell-neurite complexes, which are required to produce canonical SAI firing patterns in mouse touch-dome afferents (<a href=\"#bib43\">Maricich et al., 2009</a>). Because the essential processes of mechanotransduction and spike initiation occur in tactile end organs, we analyzed the impact of end-organ architecture on touch-evoked responses. As it is not yet possible to directly record from tactile end organs embedded in mammalian skin, we employed a combined experimental and computational modeling approach to identify simple structural principles that can account for the SAI afferent\u2019s mechanosensory coding properties."

Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) antibodies were used to visualize myelin end points and gaps, which are the sites of heminodes and nodes of Ranvier, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). We identified intense, punctate immunoreactivity for the voltage-activated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 at myelin end points and myelin gaps in cutaneous afferents. In SAI afferents, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 puncta localized to 93% of observed myelin end points (N = 28/30, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and 100% of myelin gaps (N = 9/9, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These data demonstrate that nodes and heminodes in SAI afferents can be reliably identified by visualizing either MBP or Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. Moreover, they identify Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 as a principal node component in these cutaneous afferents. We did not observe immunoreactivity against voltage-activated sodium or potassium channels in unmyelinated neurites juxtaposed to Merkel cells (N = 201 Merkel cell-neurite complexes), although it is possible that these channels are present at levels below detection threshold. Based on the strong enrichment of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 at heminodes, we infer that spikes likely initiate at these sites, as they do in Pacinian corpuscles (<a href=\"#bib41\">Loewenstein and Rathkamp, 1958</a>), rather than initiating in SAI-afferent terminals."

In 83% of touch domes surveyed, Merkel cells were innervated by branches of a single SAI afferent (N = 18, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013D\u2019,F\u2013F\u2019</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

We focused quantitative analysis on touch domes with single-afferent innervation (N = 15). Afferents displayed five to seven nested orders of branches. Arbor complexity, as represented by the highest branching order, did not correlate with Merkel-cell number (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), which ranged almost fivefold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Total branch number varied more than twofold between touch domes, and unmyelinated neurites accounted for most of this variation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Quantities of myelinated branches and heminodes were more restricted and were independent of Merkel-cell counts (linear regression p=0.56 and 0.55, respectively). Most Merkel cells (&gt;85%) were directly contacted by neurites, suggesting that they were incorporated into afferent arbors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). Similarly, \u226580% of terminal neurites were occupied by Merkel cells in most touch domes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). This quantitative analysis reveals a surprising degree of structural diversity in SAI-afferent end organs, particularly in the abundance of Merkel cell\u2013neurite complexes.

Most Merkel cells were arranged individually on terminal neurites (70%, N <i>=</i> 165, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>), although chains of three or more Merkel cells along individual neurites were occasionally observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ebara et al., 2008</a>).

To quantify the degree of structural asymmetry within an arbor, heminodes were ordered by the size of their Merkel-cell clusters (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>).

By using a GFP-expressing Merkel-cell reporter strain (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lumpkin et al., 2003</a>), we visualized the number of Merkel cells within each touch dome, which represents an upper bound on the number of Merkel cell\u2013neurite complexes in the SAI-afferent arbor (N = 4 SAI afferents; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). We first tested for a relationship between the total number of Merkel cells and the latency of first spikes, a measure that reliably conveys information about dynamic tactile stimuli (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johansson and Birznieks, 2004</a>). For the first spike, which is independent of active zone resetting, the latency to reach firing threshold is expected to be inversely proportional to the number of transduction units activated by a given stimulus. Thus, touch domes with large Merkel-cell complements should have short first spike latencies compared with small touch domes. We grouped large touch domes (20 and 22 Merkel cells) and small touch domes (12 and 13 Merkel cells) to account for the possibility that up to 15% of Merkel cells were not innervated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). As predicted, first spike latencies were significantly shorter in large touch domes (mean \u00b1 SEM, 10.9 \u00b1 1.6 ms, N = 57) compared with small touch domes (40.0 \u00b1 14.5 ms, N = 60; p = 0.027; Student\u2019s <i>t</i> test, one-tailed) for suprathreshold stimuli. These data suggest that having more Merkel cell\u2013neurite complexes in a touch dome results in a faster response during dynamic indentation. We also noted that the variance of first spike latencies was significantly higher in small touch domes (p&lt;0.0001; two-sample F test, two-tailed), which suggests that SAI afferents with fewer transduction units display less reliable spike timing during dynamic stimulation."

As our 3-mm probe tip is large enough to cover several touch domes, it is possible that mechanical sensitivity scales with the number of touch domes innervated by an individual afferent. To rule out this possibility, we manually probed the skin\u2019s surface to identify all receptive fields for each SAI afferent. For computational modeling, we analyzed SAI afferents whose receptive fields were limited to single touch domes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). To determine whether single touch-dome innervation is typical of SAI afferents in adult mice, we analyzed a larger dataset of SAI afferent recordings that was not biased for receptive field structure (N = 27 afferents). We found that 19 SAI afferents innervated individual touch domes, six innervated two touch domes each and two afferents innervated three touch domes each. Thus, the percentage of SAI afferents that innervate multiple touch domes in the hindlimb of adult mice (30%) is much lower than that reported in cats (&gt;60%; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tapper, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Iggo and Muir, 1969</a>) or mouse neonatal back skin (3/4 SAI afferents; <a href=\"#bib62\">Woodbury and Koerber, 2007</a>)."

A second possibility is that a touch dome might be innervated by multiple SAI afferents. In that case, the number of Merkel cells contacted by each afferent would be lower, resulting in reduced firing rates and mechanical sensitivities. This scenario is likely to apply to only a minority of mouse touch domes because &gt;80% of reconstructed touch domes were innervated by a single myelinated afferent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>); therefore, we sought to identify additional structural features that might account, in part, for differences in touch-evoked firing.

The transduction function predicted an adapting receptor current, <i>I(t)</i>, whose form is consistent with those recorded from a wide range of mechanosensory receptor cells, including inner-ear hair cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eatock et al., 1987</a>), <i>Drosphila</i> bristle neurons (<a href=\"#bib58\">Walker et al., 2000</a>), and somatosensory neurons in vitro (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lechner et al., 2009</a>). Third, a neural dynamics module, consisting of an array of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) models that represent spike initiation zones, summed receptor currents and, at threshold, produced spike times. A unique feature of this network model is that it allows for reconfigurable transduction functions that represent asymmetrically grouped Merkel cell\u2013neurite complexes at spike initiation zones."

The interaction of these two parameters was examined by systematically adding transduction units to four prototypical models to increase end-organ size. For each arbor, two strategies were used to \u2018fill up\u2019 clusters until they equaled the size of the primary cluster. In a first set of simulations, transduction units were progressively added to secondary clusters. Alternatively, transduction units were added to smallest clusters (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The first strategy, which skewed the distribution of transduction units, boosted firing rates more than equalizing the distribution with the second strategy (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). For example, increasing transduction units from 17 to 24 augmented responses on average by 39% when they were added to secondary clusters but only by 21% when they were more evenly distributed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, Arbor 1). This effect was consistently observed across prototypical models (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, Arbors 2\u20134).

In this study, we combined neuroanatomy, electrophysiology and computational modeling to identify structural features of a mammalian touch receptor that have the potential to impact neuronal firing. Our morphometric analysis extends previous studies that visualized arbors of neonatal SAI afferents by tracer iontophoresis (<a href=\"#bib62\">Woodbury and Koerber, 2007</a>) and surveyed cutaneous afferents in mouse hairy skin by sparse genetic labeling (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wu et al., 2012</a>). To our knowledge, this study is the first to construct computational models of mammalian tactile afferents that are constrained with structural parameters quantified from intact tactile end organs. Computational results predict that asymmetric clustering of transduction sites at spike initiation zones regulates mechanosensory coding in a branched tactile afferent.

The observation that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 localizes to almost all heminodes and nodes within an end organ suggests that this ion channel plays an important role in spike initiation and integration in tactile afferents; however, other Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms might also be found at these sensory endings. SAI afferents display unusually high instantaneous firing frequencies exceeding 1000 Hz (<a href=\"#bib29\">Iggo and Muir, 1969</a>).

Although most terminal neurites innervate single Merkel cells, the Gaussian distribution of these connections suggests that they are formed through probabilistic rather than deterministic mechanisms. Interestingly, touch-dome afferents display exuberant terminal branching in <i>Atoh1</i> knockout mice, which lack Merkel cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Maricich et al., 2009</a>). These findings suggest that targeting and maintenance of touch-dome innervation is independent of Merkel cell-derived signals.

First, empirical models such as those of Goodwin and Wheat use simple regression functions to abstract away the roles of skin and mechanoreceptors. These models focus on the role of noise and receptor co-variance in predicting population responses that align with psychophysical studies (<a href=\"#bib25\">Goodwin and Wheat, 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2002</a>). Second, skin mechanics models use finite elements and continuum mechanics to represent how surface forces propagate to tactile end organs, but abstract away neural dynamics by using scaling functions to predict firing rates. A limitation is that these models only predict firing rates for steady-state stimuli as opposed to spike times. Finally, neural dynamics models convert receptor currents to spike timing but disregard the skin\u2019s role in shaping end-organ output. For vibratory stimuli delivered with a skin-attached probe, this simplification is reasonable as the skin\u2019s role is minimal when it follows probe movement closely. By contrast, viscoelastic skin relaxation occurs during sustained touch stimuli, such as those encoded by SAI afferents (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen et al., 1999</a>)."

Prior models have employed rate-sensitive transduction functions and LIF functions to make spike timing predictions by calculating SAI membrane potential as a function of vibration frequency and magnitude (<a href=\"#bib20\">Freeman and Johnson, 1982a</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">1982b</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2010</a>).

In this study, we utilized multiple, resettable LIF models in conjuction with transduction functions parameterized by the number of Merkel cell\u2013neurite complexes. We introduced noise at the level of current within the transduction functions. Another approach to recreate the SAI afferent\u2019s irregular interspike intervals could be to introduce probabilistic firing and adaptive thresholds at spike initiation zones, similar to that done for vibratory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jahangiri and Gerling, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dong et al., 2013</a>).

What is the biological advantage of distributing transduction complexes among multiple heminodes, as we observed for SAI afferents? First, given that the skin is our body\u2019s protective covering, this arrangement could serve as a safety feature by increasing robustness to injury. Second, for cutaneous afferents with large receptive fields, multiple spike initiation zones ensure high-fidelity signal propagation from branches located millimeters apart (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wu et al., 2012</a>). For example, an SAI afferent can innervate 2\u20135 touch domes, each spaced \u223c0.7 mm apart (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tapper, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Iggo and Muir, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Woodbury and Koerber, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wellnitz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2011</a>). We also noted that heminodes were located within 19\u201341 \u00b5m of lanceolate endings innervating hair follicles (N = 7 end organs). As individual rapidly adapting afferents can innervate tens to hundreds of hair follicles (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wu et al., 2012</a>), this observation suggests that spike initiation zones in close proximity to end organs is a general feature of myelinated tactile afferents. Third, distinct clusters might extend the receptor\u2019s range of sensory coding (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eagles and Purple, 1974</a>). For example, individual muscle-spindle afferents are proposed to encode both dynamic and static stimuli by innervating distinct structures called bag and chain fibers (<a href=\"#bib49\">Quick et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Banks et al., 1997</a>).

Johnson and colleagues hypothesized that hot spots correlate with the locations of individual Merkel cell\u2013neurite complexes; however, their observations of 3\u20135 hot spots per receptive field in primates (<a href=\"#bib47\">Phillips et al., 1992</a>) coincides well with our finding of 2\u20136 heminodes per touch-dome SAI afferent. Thus, we propose that the structural basis of a receptive-field hot spot is a cluster of Merkel cell\u2013neurite complexes at a heminode. As SAI-afferent receptive field sizes and skin structure differ markedly between primate plantar skin and mouse touch domes, these observations suggest an organizing principle for SAI-afferent end organs across species and skin sites. Confirming the anatomical basis of hot spots will require the development of new transgenic mice to visualize individual SAI afferent branches during intact electrophysiological recordings, as well as microstimulation techniques to deliver controlled punctate stimuli to individual Merkel cells or Merkel cells clustered at single heminodes. To model such punctate stimuli will require building, validating and experimentally constraining new finite element models with a finer discretized mesh than the one used here."

Recordings were made from adult <i>Atoh1/nGFP</i> transgenic mice to visualize Merkel cells within the intact skin. Mechanical stimuli were delivered via a ceramic cylindrical probe (3-mm tip diameter) mounted on a displacement-controlled indenter. Stimuli were 5-s displacements ranging from 0.01 to 0.36 mm and applied in a randomized order. The skin\u2019s reactive force was monitored with a load cell mounted on the indenter. Ramp-phase firing rates were calculated by dividing the number of spikes during the ramp phase by the ramp duration (i.e., the time period from probe contact with skin to final displacement). This calculation differs from a previous study that analyzed dynamic firing during the first 200 ms of stimulation, including the ramp phase and the period of rapid adaptation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wellnitz et al., 2010</a>). Static firing rate was defined as the number spikes per second calculated during a 2.5-s window after the stimulus probe had reached its commanded depth. This time window excludes the period of rapid adaption that follows the dynamic phase of the SAI response."

A two-dimensional axisymmetric mesh represented the epidermis (17-\u00b5m thick), dermis (224-\u00b5m thick), subcutaneous tissue (101-\u00b5m thick) and the elastic substrate under the skin in the electrophysiology recording chamber to accurately represent experimental conditions. ABAQUS Standard (ver. 6.6) was used to create the model\u2019s geometry and mesh and was used for the FE analysis. The mesh contained 11,200 elements and utilized four-node, bilinear quadrilateral hybrid elements with constant pressure (ABAQUS type CAX4H). Boundary conditions were imposed such that nodes along the bottom of the substrate were constrained in the X and Y directions. FEM parameters were chosen from within bounds reported for mammalian tissues to generate displacement-force curves in close agreement with those observed in ex-vivo skin-nerve preparations. The resulting parameters were C10 = 14,847 and C01 = 41,410 for the Mooney-Rivlin skin model, and <i>E</i> = 906098 for the linear-elastic substrate. Prony parameters were <i>g</i><sub><i>1</i></sub> = 0.391, <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>1</i></sub> = 0.25, <i>g</i><sub><i>2</i></sub> = 0.226, and <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>2</i></sub> = 9.371. These parameters governed the model\u2019s transformation of indentation into SED, a measure of tissue distortion that correlates with the intensity of the SAI afferent response (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dandekar et al., 2003</a>). SED was sampled from two elements approximating the volume and location of the SAI-afferent end organ, which was located beneath the cylindrical probe that contacted the model\u2019s surface. This probe was represented as a rigid analytic surface with a friction coefficient of 0.3 between the probe tip and skin. Due to the large diameter of the cylindrical probe (3 mm) relative to mouse touch domes (\u223c0.1 mm), SED magnitude was assumed to be uniform across all Merkel cell\u2013neurite complexes in the end organ."

The authors employed immunohistochemistry to identify heminodes (the initiation site of action potentials) and nodes of Ranvier of SAI afferents. They found that there was a large degree of variability in peripheral innervation and firing properties of SAI afferents. Strikingly, the difference in mechanical sensitivity of different SAI afferents does not directly correlate with the total number of innervated Merkel cells (i.e., afferents innervating a smaller number of Merkel cells can have a similar mechanical sensitivity to that of afferents innervating many more Merkel cells). Using a combination of computational models with consideration of skin compression, sensory transduction, and integration of afferent branching, they propose that the variability is likely due to an asymmetric distribution of Merck cell innervation by a single afferent with multiple branches. Their models predict that touch evoked firing is increased when Merkel cell-nerve complexes are arranged in a skewed distribution among heminodes, which provides an underlying mechanism for the driver effect of a dominant branch over other minor branches proposed by previous studies."

The underpinning assumption is that the morphological relationships of Merkel cell-neurite associations and hemi-nodes in individual touch domes form a valid starting point for mathematical modeling of the firing properties recorded from SAI afferent fibers. However, while most touch domes are innervated by a single large myelinated axon, the converse is not true, as the majority of SAI afferent fibers innervate multiple touch domes (as detailed in the cited literature). Importantly, because the authors used an extremely large (3 mm diameter) probe tip to apply stimuli and because touch domes are closely spaced (&lt;1 mm apart, cited by authors), their large probe tip certainly stimulated multiple touch domes, up to 5 (and potentially more). There is a high probability, therefore, that the single fibers recorded by the authors innervated multiple touch domes, and thus the electrophysiological records that are pivotal to the validation of their model, likely represent the combined output from multiple touch domes stimulated simultaneously. These separate outputs would be expected to interfere substantially at branch points on the parent axon distal to the recording electrode, which could explain the wide variation observed by the authors in firing rate across fibers. In addition, without knowing how many touch domes contributed to the responses recorded from single SAI fibers, conclusions that mechanical sensitivity of SAI fibers does \u201cnot scale with total Merkel cell number\u201d are questionable since total Merkel cell number is not known. Although it is indeed interesting that the authors were able to model actual recordings, uncertainty remains whether this ability might attest more to the flexibility (i.e., reconfigurability) of the model than to its biological validity."

Of course it would be even more valuable if the same individual touch domes were also reconstructed morphologically for subsequent modeling purposes, as discussed by the authors."

The authors state that the dotted line in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> is the receptive field of the SAI afferent whose responses are given in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. The receptive field size is therefore much smaller than the probe tip used for mechanical stimulation, and the important thing is that there is only one SAI afferent (this one) that was stimulated. We presume that the authors must have been able to identify single touch domes with receptive fields in this way in order to obtain the data plotted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>. We also presume that if there had been additional touch domes innervated by the same afferent, they must have been able to detect that. We think that this is the case based on the description of the properties of SAI afferents given by some of the authors in their J Neurophysiol paper (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wellnitz et al., 2010</a>; 103, 3378), which they cite for details of the electrophysiological method (see especially page 3384 where they mention recording from 2 afferents each innervating 2 touch domes)."

For computational modeling, we only included fibers that responded to stimulation of a single touch dome.

This is a key component of the driver effect because it suppresses firing from the other branches, which gives a bias to the spike initiation zone that fires first. Although noise in transduction models introduces an element of stochasticity, the branch with the most transduction units has the highest likelihood of reaching spike threshold first."

We cannot confirm this quantitatively with our present models, which are built to simulate flat-field rather than punctate stimuli. During these skin-nerve electrophysiological recordings, we use a 3-mm diameter, filleted stimulus probe to deliver a consistent state of stress to the entire receptive field. This helps accommodate for small but inevitable imprecision in stimulus placement and avoids the uncontrolled stress gradients that would occur with a spherical stimulus. To computationally represent this flat-field stimulus, we have modeled the skin with elements that have edge lengths of 100 \u00b5m. This makes it impossible to apply stress to only the driver branch because it would occur on a sub-element scale. To model a punctate stimulus across different branches will require building, validating and experimentally constraining new finite element models with a finer discretized mesh. Future studies will address this fascinating question."

It would be interesting to examine whether the initial firings, which should not be affected by the resetting mechanism, from SAI afferents with more Merkel endings are always stronger than those from afferents with fewer Merkel endings no matter how Merkel endings are distributed among different heminodes. This information can be obtained by re-examining existing recording data and the simulations</i>."

To account for this, we grouped small touch domes (12 and 13 Merkel cells) and large touch domes (20 and 22 Merkel cells) to represent our level of resolution. Consistent with the reviewers\u2019 prediction, first spike latencies were significantly shorter in the large touch dome group (mean\u00b1SEM, <i>N</i>; for large touch domes: 10.9\u00b11.6 ms, N=57; for small touch domes: 40.0\u00b114.5 ms, <i>N</i>=60; P=0.027; Student\u2019s unpaired <i>t</i> test, one-tailed). We also noted that the variability of first spike latencies was significantly higher in the small touch dome group (P&lt;0.0001), which suggests that touch domes with fewer transduction units fire less reliably during dynamic stimuli."
