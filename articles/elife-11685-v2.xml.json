Monomers and oligomers of the M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic receptor therefore have been compared to identify those allosteric properties that are gained in oligomers. Allosteric interactions were monitored by means of a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site and in pharmacological assays involving mutants engineered to preclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of allostery at the atomic level were examined in molecular dynamics simulations. Allosteric effects in monomers were exclusively negative and derived primarily from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Allosteric effects in oligomers could be positive or negative, depending upon the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and they arose from interactions within and between the constituent protomers. The complex behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations."

Monomers and oligomers of the M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic receptor therefore have been compared to identify those allosteric properties that are gained in oligomers. Allosteric interactions were monitored by means of a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site and in pharmacological assays involving mutants engineered to preclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of allostery at the atomic level were examined in molecular dynamics simulations. Allosteric effects in monomers were exclusively negative and derived primarily from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Allosteric effects in oligomers could be positive or negative, depending upon the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and they arose from interactions within and between the constituent protomers. The complex behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations."

This involved developing a method to track the receptor in mammalian cells using a fluorescent sensor that detects changes in the allosteric site. The experiments show that two or more GPCRs need to interact for the receptors to respond to allosteric drugs in a manner that reflects the normal effect of the drugs on the body. This result is unexpected in light of the assumption that individual receptor molecules act independently. Shivnaraine et al.\u2019s findings indicate that the clusters may play a role in the normal behavior of GPCRs in cells. A future challenge is to understand exactly how the GPCRs interact with each other."

Taken together, the results indicate that intramolecular interactions\u2014<i>i.e</i>., between two sites on a monomer or on the same protomer of an oligomer\u2014are dominated by electrostatic repulsion and result in low-affinity negative modulation by the allosteric ligand.

The amount of receptor was determined from the binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]QNB at the saturating concentration of 10 nM. Following electrophoresis and transfer, the membranes were blotted with anti-c-Myc antibody. (<b>B</b>) Gels were loaded with parallel samples of purified M<sub>2</sub> receptor taken before (lane 1) and after cross-linking with BS<sup>3</sup> (lane 2). The same amount of receptor was applied to each well (15\u201325 fmol). The intensities of the immunopositive bands were measured by densitometry, and the area under each densitometric trace was determined in three segments as indicated by the braces (<i>a</i>, 40\u201375\u00a0kDa; <i>b</i>, 75\u2013170 kDa; <i>c</i>, 170\u2013360 kDa) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>, <i>N</i> = 3).

For more direct information on those interactions and related conformational changes, we developed a sensor based on FRET between FlAsH and mCherry. FlAsH was incorporated via the hairpin-forming sequence FLNCCPGCCMEP (FCM) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hoffmann et al., 2010</a>), which was inserted after Val<sup>166</sup> in the second extracellular loop (ECL2), and mCherry was fused to the amino terminus (<i>i.e.</i>, mCh-M<sub>2</sub>-FCM)."

The purified complex retained the sites of high and intermediate affinity for gallamine that are seen in native preparations of the wild-type receptor but not the site of low affinity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>); whereas the former are associated with oligomers, only the latter is observed in monomers.

While modeling the loop, the rest of the protein was constrained to the crystallographic conformation. FlAsH was built in MOE 2013.08 (Molecular Operating Environment, 2014) and attached to the insertion sequence (CCPGCC) via covalent bonds between the sulfur atoms of the cysteine residues and the arsenic atoms of FlAsH. The length of the sulfur-to-arsenic bonds was set at 2.275\u2009\u00c5.

The electrostatic potential of an allosteric ligand in the absence and presence of an orthosteric ligand was calculated using the CHARMM27 force\u00a0field, and the difference was taken as a measure of the energetic cost of repulsion. A degree of electrostatic repulsion was observed with all four ligand-pairs. The effect was observed throughout the simulations, but it diminished over time as the cations compensated by moving apart. In the case of strychnine and QNB, for example, the average difference in electrostatic potential was 0.7 kcal/mol over the first 10 ns of production and 0.06 kcal/mol over a period of 30 ns. Because the average electrostatic potential of the ligands over time does not scale directly with the degree of repulsion, the result of repulsion was tracked in terms of distance."

The manuscript combines a novel FRET approach based on spectral unmixing with molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulations to understanding the nature of positive and negative cooperativity between orthosteric and allosteric sites in the receptor. As in previous work based on ligand binding in purified monomers or oligomers, you show that only negative cooperativity can be detected between the orthosteric and allosteric sites using a FlAsH-FRET approach. Using binding defective mutants you show that cooperativity between these two sites is lost but can be restored by an untagged WT receptor, suggesting that this allostery is rescued only in the context of an oligomeric receptor. The approach is elegant and the data is supported by your previous binding studies. The reviewers point out that your group has consistently provided the best proof for receptor oligomerization and its allosteric consequences. Nevertheless, they had a few substantive concerns they would like you to address."

The difference is due in part to a longer averaging time, giving a higher signal-to-noise ratio, and in part to improvements in the method of analysis. The fluorescence decay traces from the horizontal and vertical channels now are fit simultaneously upon deconvolution of the instrument response function assuming a mono-exponential decay of the intensity and another exponential term that defines the rotational correlation time.

We now have shown that, in membranes from CHO cells, the modified receptor displays the characteristic triphasic effect of gallamine on the binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]NMS. We see that as persuasive evidence for the retention of the allosteric properties."

That would be of interest if one were planning experiments on reconstituted tetramers, and it certainly would support our claim that reconstituted tetramers are a faithful reconstruction of the native state [Ma et al. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 7907\u20137927; Redk aet al. (2013) Biochemistry 52, 7405\u20137427; Redka et al. (2014) ibid.], but those issues are beyond the scope of the present manuscript. If the native allosteric properties were not recovered upon reconstitution of the mutant in liposomes, it would raise questions about the nature of that reconstituted preparation, but it would not invalidate our conclusions regarding the modified receptor in CHO membranes or whole cells."

It is clear from the present data that all of the complexity represented by the triphasic, serpentine binding curves is absent from monomers in solution, which behave as one would expect for a single orthosteric site and a single allosteric site on the same protomer. When we compare affinities, it is between the single affinity of gallamine or strychnine for monomers in solution and the affinities for oligomers in solution. It is not clear to us how the story would be advanced by measurements on monomers in nanodiscs. Also, the binding of agonists and antagonists to monomers is essentially the same in solution and after reconstitution in nanodiscs [e.g., Redka et al. (2014) ibid.]. It seems reasonable to suppose that the same would be true of intramolecular allosteric effects."
