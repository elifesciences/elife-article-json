                    "text": "In response to an osmotic challenge, the synthesis of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) increases in the hypothalamus, and this is accompanied by extension of the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail of the AVP mRNA, and the up-regulation of the expression of RNA binding protein Caprin-2. Here we show that Caprin-2 binds to AVP mRNAs, and that lentiviral mediated shRNA knockdown of Caprin-2 in the osmotically stimulated hypothalamus shortens the AVP mRNA poly(A) tail at the same time as reducing transcript abundance. In a recapitulated in vitro system, we confirm that Caprin-2 over-expression enhances AVP mRNA abundance and poly(A) tail length. Importantly, we show that Caprin-2 knockdown in the hypothalamus decreases urine output and fluid intake, and increases urine osmolality, urine sodium concentration, and plasma AVP levels. Thus Caprin-2 controls physiological mechanisms that are essential for the body's response to osmotic stress."

Here we show that Caprin-2 binds to AVP mRNAs, and that lentiviral mediated shRNA knockdown of Caprin-2 in the osmotically stimulated hypothalamus shortens the AVP mRNA poly(A) tail at the same time as reducing transcript abundance. In a recapitulated in vitro system, we confirm that Caprin-2 over-expression enhances AVP mRNA abundance and poly(A) tail length. Importantly, we show that Caprin-2 knockdown in the hypothalamus decreases urine output and fluid intake, and increases urine osmolality, urine sodium concentration, and plasma AVP levels. Thus Caprin-2 controls physiological mechanisms that are essential for the body's response to osmotic stress."

In mammals, a hormone called arginine vasopressin regulates water and salt levels in the whole body. This hormone is made by cells in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus, and is then transported to the pituitary gland. When the level of water relative to the level of salts in the blood starts to drop (i.e., during dehydration), arginine vasopressin is released into the blood and travels to the kidneys where it acts as a signal to retain more water in the body."

Like all proteins, arginine vasopressin is made by first copying a template encoded in a particular gene into a molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). During dehydration, the cells in the hypothalamus produce more of these corresponding mRNA molecules. Also, the mRNAs are slightly larger than normal because they have longer \u2018polyA tails\u2019 (structures added to the ends of all newly-made mRNAs). However, it was not clear how or why this happens."

The experiments show that a protein called Caprin-2 accumulates in hypothalamic neurons when rats are dehydrated. Furthermore, Caprin-2 is able to directly bind to the mRNA that encodes arginine vasopressin and is responsible for increasing the length of the polyA tail. To test whether this interaction is important for regulating the balance of water and salts, Konopacka et al. decreased the levels of Caprin-2 protein in the hypothalamus of live rats. When these rats became dehydrated, they had lower levels of the arginine vasopressin mRNA and these mRNAs had shorter polyA tails. Furthermore, the rats drank less water and urinated less than normal rats. Further experiments show that Caprin-2 helps to stabilize the structure of these mRNAs so that they accumulate in cells."

In mammals, this process is centrally regulated by the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS), the source of the antidiuretic neuropeptide hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). The HNS consists of the large peptidergic magnocellular neurones (MCNs) of the hypothalamic supraoptic nuclei (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN), the axons of which course though the internal zone of the median eminence and terminate on blood capillaries of the posterior pituitary (PP) gland (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bargmann, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Burbach et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Antunes-Rodrigues et al., 2004</a>), a neuro\u2013vascular interface through which the brain regulates peripheral organs in order to maintain homeostasis."

Delivery of AVP to the pituitary starts with the insertion of the preprohormone into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum with the removal of the SP. The resulting prohormone is folded then routed unidirectionally to the trans-Golgi network, where it is targeted specifically into the large dense core vesicle of the regulated secretory pathway. Whilst these granules are anterogradely transported some considerable distance towards the PP, the prohormone is processed to generate the biologically active, mature AVP, which is stored in PP axon terminals until mobilised for secretion into the systemic circulation. The rise in plasma osmolality that follows dehydration is detected by intrinsic MCN mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bourque, 2008</a>) and by specialised osmoreceptive neurons in the circumventricular organs such as the subfornical organ, which provide excitatory inputs to shape the firing activity of MCNs for hormone secretion (<a href=\"#bib25\">McKinley et al., 2004</a>). Upon release, AVP travels through the blood stream to specific receptor targets located in the kidney where it promotes water reabsorption in the collecting duct (<a href=\"#bib7\">Breyer and Ando, 1994</a>), and sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ares et al., 2011</a>)."

We performed an RNA immunoprecipitation assay on extracts from the SON and PVN of EU and SL rats using anti-Caprin-2 antibodies, followed by qRT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The level of Caprin-2-AVP mRNA binding was quantified by comparing it to the signal detected with the non-specific binding control IgG performed simultaneously for each individual sample. In all samples incubated with Caprin-2 antibody, we found AVP mRNA at levels 1\u20132 orders of magnitude higher than in samples incubated with non-specific IgG.

Importantly, we demonstrate that Caprin-2 knockdown in the SON and PVN disrupts physiological osmoregulatory mechanisms. Normally, chronic salt loading leads to a gradual increase of urine output and fluid intake. Loss of Caprin-2 significantly reduces the salt loading-induced urine output and fluid intake and increases urine osmolality, urine sodium concentration and plasma AVP levels."

The increase in AVP biosynthesis in MCNs that follows osmotic stimulation is accompanied by a plethora of changes in gene expression (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mutsuga et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hindmarch et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Yue et al., 2006</a>). One of the novel genes identified as such by transcriptome analysis was Caprin-2. Here we confirm the transcriptome data, and that Caprin-2 protein is up-regulated at the mRNA level by chronic hyperosmotic cues. Using double immunostaining we also provide evidence that Caprin-2 protein is present in the cytoplasm of VP MCNs, and that its expression increases during osmotic stress. Caprin-2 has been reported to play a role in several physiological processes, including differentiation, apoptosis in erythroblasts or lens fiber cells, and synaptic plasticity in the mouse cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aerbajinai et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ding et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lor\u00e9n et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Miao et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Flores and Zhong, 2015</a>). Although expression of Caprin-2 in the HNS has been reported (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mutsuga et al., 2004</a>), its role in the maintenance of fluid homeostasis had not previously been addressed. We therefore investigated the physiological consequences of Caprin-2 gene knockdown using virally delivered specific shRNAs in the SON and PVN in vivo. The Caprin-2 shRNA had no effect on water homeostasis in euhydrated rats. In na\u00efve rats (<a href=\"#bib19\">Greenwood et al., 2015</a>), and in rats transduced with a scrambled control shRNA, as shown here, salt loading results in production of large amounts of dilute urine and excessive fluid intake. However, compared to the control animals, salt loaded Caprin-2 knockdown rats only minimally increased their urine production and they drank less fluid. Urine osmolality and sodium levels were also higher in Caprin-2 knockdown rats. These observations may be explained by water retention resulting from the elevated plasma AVP levels found in the Caprin-2 shRNA-transduced rats. Our data suggest that Caprin-2 knockdown rats increase their ability to concentrate urine and so doing they prevent the decrease in sodium excretion (i.e., elevation of plasma sodium) resulting from lower urine output by producing more concentrated urine."

Here we show that Caprin-2 does indeed bind to AVP mRNAs in the SON and PVN in vivo. We then asked if Caprin-2 binding has any role in the alterations in AVP mRNA metabolism that occur as a consequence of the chronic osmotic stimuli of dehydration or salt-loading, namely an increase in abundance (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sherman et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Murphy and Carter, 1990</a>), and the unusual post-transcriptional modification of an increase in the length of the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carrazana et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zingg et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carter and Murphy, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Murphy and Carter, 1990</a>). Our in vivo studies show that knockdown of Caprin-2 in the rat SON and PVN prevented the salt-loading-induced increases in the abundance of the AVP mRNA, and the elongation of its poly(A) tail. In HEK293T cells transfected with a plasmid containing rat AVP genomic sequences under constitutive CMV promoter, concomitant overexpression of Caprin-2 increased AVP mRNA abundance, whilst addition of the Caprin-2 shRNA significantly reduced AVP mRNA levels. At the same time, Caprin-2 overexpression resulted in elongation of the poly(A) tail of the AVP mRNA, whilst Caprin-2 knockdown shortened the poly(A) tails of the AVP mRNA. The direct binding and positive regulation of AVP transcript levels suggest that Caprin-2 may be important for stabilization of AVP mRNAs during osmotic stress, in a similar way to another AVP mRNA binding protein, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mohr et al., 2002</a>). It is thus tempting to speculate that the two processes, increased poly(A) tail length and increased mRNA abundance, are consequential. An important role of poly(A) tail length in regulation of mRNA degradation and stability has been demonstrated for many transcripts (<a href=\"#bib15\">Curinha et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). It is therefore possible that one of the functions of Caprin-2-mediated poly(A) tail length regulation is protection of AVP transcripts from degradation, which in turn would lead to the observed increase of AVP mRNA levels. Note that we are unable to distinguish between a process that promotes polyadenylation, or one that prevents deadenylation."

Although the precise mechanisms underlying this paradoxical effect require separate investigation, examination of the existing literature leads us to propose two possible hypotheses. Firstly, Caprin-2 binding to AVP mRNA might inhibit translation, a phenomenon observed as a consequence of other association mRNA-RNA-binding protein interactions, such as the binding of PABP to the AVP mRNA (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mohr et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Richter, 2008</a>). This is not necessarily in disagreement with the fact that Caprin-2 stimulates extension of poly(A) tail in AVP mRNAs\u2014recent studies have revealed that a correlation between the length of poly(A) tail and translational activity is not always present (<a href=\"#bib37\">Weill et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Subtelny et al., 2014</a>)."

This is consistent with our observation that Caprin-2 knockdown in the SON and PVN increases circulating plasma AVP levels. It is conceivable that this effect results from the increased translation of AVP mRNA under conditions when Caprin-2 protein level is too low to suppress this process. Moreover, knockdown of Caprin-2, whilst increasing the translation of the AVP mRNA, might increase its turnover, and hence decreases steady state transcript levels and poly(A) tail length. We have previously examined the polysome distribution of the AVP mRNA in euhydrated and salt-loaded SON (<a href=\"#bib28\">Murphy and Carter, 1990</a>), and showed no difference in the pattern association with heavy polysome fractions. However, the AVP mRNA is small, and subject to a high rate of translation, even in euhydrated animals. Thus, the rates of translation initiation, elongation and termination, none of which are directly measured by polysome analysis, especially when the size of the RNA limits ribosome number, could be influenced, positively or negatively, by poly(A) tail length. Quantification of Caprin-2 and AVP levels in AVP in the SON neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) revealed that salt-loading elicits a significant increase in the former protein, but a significant decrease in the latter, consistent with Caprin-2 being an inhibitor of the translation of the AVP mRNA. However, it is important to point out the steady-state level of AVP in hypothalamic MCNs is not only determined by translation rate. As we describe in some detail in the Introduction, the AVP precursor is subject to axonal transport from cell bodies in the hypothalamus to terminals in the PP, a process that is activated by the need to deliver mature peptide to the circulation following an osmotic stimulus. Thus, further studies are needed to examine the translation of the AVP mRNA under different physiological conditions."

Dendritic release and autocrine or paracrine action of AVP has been well documented (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ludwig and Stern, 2015</a>). AVP released from dendrites inhibits the electrical activity of AVP neurons, thus suppressing axonal release to the blood stream (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ludwig and Stern, 2015</a>). Caprin-2 protein is present in the RNA granules localized in the rat neuronal dendrites (<a href=\"#bib35\">Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010</a>). Therefore, it is possible that Caprin-2 knockdown results in a decrease of the synthesis and dendritic release of AVP, which in turn decreases AVP-mediated auto-inhibition of AVP neurons and leads to an increase of AVP release in the neurohypophysis and increased plasma concentration, as we observe after Caprin-2 knockdown in the SON and PVN."

On the basis of these data, we propose a new mechanism mediating the regulation of AVP gene expression (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Whilst it has previously been demonstrated that a chronic osmotic stimulus results in an increase in the transcription of the AVP gene (<a href=\"#bib28\">Murphy and Carter, 1990</a>), the data presented here provides new evidence that post-transcriptional process, governed by Caprin-2, are also operative. Both the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional mechanisms would contribute to overall steady-state AVP mRNA abundance. However, it would appear that the increase in AVP mRNA mediated by Caprin-2 does not result in an increase in AVP peptide production. Indeed, our results are consistent with previous reports that showed that Caprin-2 inhibits translation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010</a>). Thus we suggest that association with Caprin-2 may inhibit the production of AVP peptide, perhaps by directly interfering with the translational apparatus, or through sequestration of AVP mRNA in translationally inert mRNP storage or transport granules (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buchan, 2014</a>). Interestingly, polysome analysis revealed a heavy class of EDTA-resistant AVP mRNA containing fractions that might represent storage granules (<a href=\"#bib28\">Murphy and Carter, 1990</a>). We also note that AVP transcripts are known to be transported to dendrites (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mohr et al., 2002</a>) and to axons (<a href=\"#bib29\">Murphy et al., 1989</a>), although in the latter case, the AVP RNAs are characterised by a short poly(A) tail that does not change in length following osmotic stimulation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Murphy et al., 1989</a>)."

Caprin-2 binds to the AVP mRNA, and mediates an increase in the length of the poly(A) tail, either by stimulating further synthesis, or by inhibiting deadenylation. Caprin-2 also mediates an increase in VP mRNA abundance, possibly by increasing transcript stability. Paradoxically, we propose that Caprin-2 inhibits translation of the AVP mRNA, perhaps by displacing ribosomes or by slowing initiation or elongation, or through mediating sequestration into translationally inert storage or transport granules."

To get a more comprehensive picture of Caprin-2 functioning in the HNS, it will be of interest to identify other mRNAs that bind to Caprin2 in the SON and PVN, in addition to those encoding AVP. Further, identification of the sequences within the AVP mRNA that are recognised by Caprin-2, and the Caprin-2 protein modules that mediate binding to the AVP mRNA and poly(A) tail extension, might reveal interactions with other known Caprin-2 functions, such as the modulation of Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ding et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Miao et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Flores and Zhong, 2015</a>) that may have regulatory and physiological relevance."

We found that the longest isoform was 3090 bp long, which encodes 1029 aa. Exons were predicted on the basis of GT and AG flanking regions of introns in rat Caprin-2 gene (NCBI reference sequence AC_000072.1, 170273255\u2013170328842, complement strand) and verified by comparison to the mouse Caprin-2 sequence ENSMUST00000111569.

Coronal hypothalamic sections were stained with anti-GFP (Abcam), AVP NP-II (PS-41, kindly provided by Prof. Harold Gainer, NIH, Bethesda, USA [<a href=\"#bib5\">Ben-Barak et al., 1985</a>]) and Caprin-2 antibodies (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology) and the imaging was performed using fluorescent confocal microscope (Leica, Germany) as described earlier. Quantification analysis has been performed on the Z-stack and single-plane confocal microscope images obtained from the SON and PVN of 5 rats injected with scrambled (Ctrl) or Caprin-2 (Cap2 KD) shRNA, using Fiji software (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a>)."

To this end two 0.8 mm holes were drilled at co-ordinates 1.3 mm posterior to bregma and 1.95 mm lateral to midline for SON injection and one 1 mm hole was drilled at co-ordinates 1.8 mm posterior to bregma, and \u00b10.4 mm lateral to midline for PVN injection, and 1 \u00b5l of LV at the concentration of 2 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> particles/ml, was delivered separately into four nuclei, over 5 min/nucleus. Like previously, at the end of surgery the rats received Antisedan (Norden Laboratories) and analgesic Rimadyl (Zoetis). After the surgery the animals were individually housed in standard laboratory cages for two and a half week before being transferred to metabolic cages (Techniplast, Italy), for precise daily measurements of fluid intake and urine output. Animals were weighed and allowed to acclimatize to the cage for 48 hr. Fluid intake, urine output, urine osmolality and body weights were recorded for 10 days, between 10\u201311 am. The animals received ad libitum water for the first 3 days, and 2% (wt/vol) NaCl for the next 7 days. At the end of the experiment the animals were culled by stunning and decapitation and trunk blood samples were collected and processed immediately for plasma isolation. Brain tissue was frozen in powdered dry ice and stored in \u221280\u00b0C for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. Accuracy of injections and Caprin-2 knockdown were confirmed by eGFP and Caprin-2 mRNA expression analysis in each individual SON and PVN using qRT-PCR. Two separate groups of animals were used. In the first group, individual Caprin-2 shRNA-injected nuclei with 25% or higher Caprin-2 knockdown (as compared to the average control, scrambled shRNA-injected PVNs or SONs) were retrospectively chosen for gene expression analysis. In the second group, rats with more than 30% of Caprin-2 gene knockdown in both SON and PVN (5 out of the 10 animals injected) were retrospectively chosen for analysis of physiological parameters."

Previous studies by this lab have shown that Caprin-2 mRNA level is induced in response to osmotic challenges. In the present manuscript they show that the induction of Caprin-2 protein is important to maintain physiological responses to osmotic stimuli (i.e. fluid intake and urine output, osmolality and sodium concentration). They associate this response to the regulation of AVP levels by Caprin-2. Thus, they show that Caprin-2, which is a known RNA-binding protein, forms a complex with AVP mRNA following osmotic challenge. Through a set of experiments using shRNA knockdown and/or overexpression of Caprin-2 in vivo and in vitro they show that the binding of Caprin-2 to AVP affects the levels of AVP mRNA via regulation of AVP's poly(A) tail elongation."

In the present manuscript they provide a mechanism for this post-transcriptional modification and associate it to a critical physiological response."

The immunostaining data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and 1D</a> need to be quantified, so both protein and RNA levels of Cap2 and AVP in SON and PVN of EU, SL and DH rats can be compared side-by-side to provide a initial hint whether a change in translation efficiency may contribute to increased AVP synthesis. Alternatively, is it possible to divide the SON and PVN lysates to isolate RNAs for RT-qPCR and to prepare protein samples for western blotting? The images in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> seem to suggest that AVP-immunostained signal is weaker in SL than EU-stimulated SON. Moreover, osmotic stress-increased Cap2 but not AVP protein is more widely occurred in SON and PVN MCN neurons. Is this true? The authors claimed this is a \u201cCaprin-2-like\u201d signal. What does this mean? Are the authors not sure this signal is really Caprin-2? Some neurons with high AVP signal did not necessarily have high Cap2 signal, vice versa. Are Cap2 also up-expressed in non-AVP neurons in response to osmotic stress or some AVP secreted already?"
