Here, we show that PexRD54, an effector from the Irish potato famine pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, binds host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation. PexRD54 depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes and interferes with Joka2's positive effect on pathogen defense. Thus, a plant pathogen effector has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses."

Here, we show that PexRD54, an effector from the Irish potato famine pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, binds host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation. PexRD54 depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes and interferes with Joka2's positive effect on pathogen defense. Thus, a plant pathogen effector has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses."

This process is known as autophagy and it involves engulfing cellular material inside spherical structures called autophagosomes, before delivering it to sites in the cell where digestive enzymes can break the material down. A form of autophagy, known as selective autophagy, can specifically degrade toxic substances such as disease-causing microbes. Selective autophagy works through proteins called autophagy cargo receptors that define which molecules are targeted for degradation. However, it was not clear whether autophagy protects plants from infections, or how much disease-causing microbes interfere with this process for their own benefit."

Future work could test these two hypotheses and explore whether other effectors from disease-causing microbes work in a similar way."

The process plays a vital role in survival of the organism by improving cellular adaptation to environmental and stress conditions (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shintani and Klionsky, 2004</a>). Autophagy provides building blocks and energy for elementary cellular processes by degrading dysfunctional or unnecessary cellular components during nutrient deprivation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shintani and Klionsky, 2004</a>). However, even though autophagy was initially thought to be a bulk degradation process activated during starvation, recent studies showed that it can act selectively, capturing specific substrates through specialized cargo receptors to respond to a variety of environmental and stress conditions (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stolz et al., 2014</a>)."

Selective autophagy is regulated through specific interactions of autophagy cargo receptors and ATG8 proteins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stolz et al., 2014</a>). Autophagy cargo receptors carry a short sequence motif called ATG8-interaction motif (AIM) that binds lipidated ATG8 proteins anchored on autophagosomal membranes. Cargo receptors mediate recognition of a diverse set of cargo (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stolz et al., 2014</a>). For instance, mammalian autophagy cargo receptors NDP52 and optineurin can recognize intracellular pathogenic bacteria and mediate their autophagic removal by sorting the captured bacteria inside the ATG8-coated autophagosomes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boyle and Randow, 2013</a>). Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanisms of selective autophagy and the components that regulate it remain unknown (<a href=\"#bib18\">Huang and Brumell, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mostowy, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Randow, 2011</a>)."

This pathogen delivers RXLR-type effector proteins inside plant cells to enable parasitism (<a href=\"#bib31\">Morgan and Kamoun, 2007</a>).

The association between PexRD54 and ATG8CL was retained under stringent binding conditions in contrast to other candidate interactors (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). We validated the association with reverse coimmunoprecipitation after co-expressing the potato ATG8CL protein with the C-terminal effector domain of PexRD54 <i>in planta</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>).

Immunogold labelling in transmission electron micrographs of cells expressing GFP:PexRD54 revealed a strong signal in electron dense structures that are not peroxisomes (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3s3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">Dagdas et al., 2016</a>). To determine whether these structures are ATG8CL autophagosomes, we transiently co-expressed RFP:PexRD54 with GFP:ATG8CL in plant cells and observed an overlap between the two fluorescent signals in sharp contrast to RFP:PexRD54<sup>AIM2</sup> and RFP:EV negative controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). This indicates that PexRD54 localizes to ATG8CL-marked autophagosomes and its C-terminal AIM is necessary for autophagosome localization. In contrast, RFP:PexRD54 signal overlapped with GFP:ATG8IL-labelled autophagosomes in only 15\u201320% of observations consistent with its weaker binding affinity to ATG8IL (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Recently, Joka2 was reported as a selective autophagy cargo receptor of Solanaceous plants that also binds ATG8 via an AIM (<a href=\"#bib43\">Svenning et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zientara-Rytter et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Indeed, <i>in planta</i> coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that potato Joka2, but not the AIM mutant, Joka2<sup>AIM</sup>, associated with ATG8CL (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Joka2 association with ATG8CL was somewhat specific given that this cargo receptor failed to coimmunoprecipitate with ATG8IL (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Joka2, but not Joka2<sup>AIM</sup>, also markedly increased the number of GFP:ATG8CL autophagosomes (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), and enhanced ATG8CL protein levels (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

We tested our hypothesis by performing coimmunoprecipitation experiments between Joka2:RFP and GFP:ATG8CL in the presence or absence of PexRD54. Remarkably, ATG8CL complexes were depleted in Joka2 in the presence of PexRD54 relative to the PexRD54<sup>AIM2</sup> and vector control (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Consistently, Joka2 binding to ATG8CL decreased with increasing PexRD54 concentrations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The distinct AIMs of PexRD54 and Joka2 presumably determine the effect observed in these competition experiments. To further test this, we replaced the functional PexRD54 AIM with two sequences that cover the Joka2 AIM:GVAEWDPI (PexRD54<sup>J2AIM1</sup>) and GVAEWDPILEELKEMG (PexRD54<sup>J2AIM2</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Both PexRD54<sup>J2AIM1</sup> and PexRD54<sup>J2AIM2</sup> associated with ATG8CL to a lesser extent than wild-type PexRD54 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), and were less effective than PexRD54 in depleting Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes (<a href=\"#fig6s6\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 6</a>).

In turn, pathogens can deploy effectors to avoid autophagy and enable parasitic infection (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baxt et al., 2013</a>). For instance, to counteract antimicrobial autophagy, intracellular bacterial pathogen <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> secretes a type IV effector protein RavZ that impedes autophagy by uncoupling ATG8-lipid linkage (<a href=\"#bib12\">Choy et al., 2012</a>). In this study, we show that a plant pathogen effector has evolved an ATG8 interacting motif to bind with high affinity to the autophagy protein ATG8CL and stimulate the formation of ATG8CL-marked autophagosomes. Unlike the Legionella effector RavZ, PexRD54 activates selective autophagy possibly to eliminate defense-related compounds or to reattribute cellular resources by promoting nutrient recycling. Our results show that, in addition to disrupting, pathogens can also activate autophagy for their own benefit (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

For example, the confocal image shows GFP-tagged PexRD54 mainly localized in some foci and the cytosol (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but the TEM image (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, please correct the figure legend, which explains A and B but not panel C) does not show any particles in the cytosol. Moreover the vesicles in which particles accumulate do not have the appearance of autophagosomes (they seem more like an aggresome due to overexpression) and this cannot explain the ring-like structure of PexRD54 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). There should be a good control photo showing an autophagosome, probably marked with ATG8CL. We suggest observing the sample expressing both constructs of PexRD54 and ATG8CL for TEM to see both at the autophagosome. Since the autophagosomes induced by PexRD54 have altered morphology (compare <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> to <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), please address the morphology difference in the manuscript. Differences in morphology could also affect quantification. Are the differences the same when overlap is quantified in a 50x50 micron area compared to all puncta found in the area? The TEM data is very important and should be in the main figure. Instead, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> can be in the supplement."

These results are consistent with the observation that overexpression of Joka2 enhances resistance. The authors provide a detailed rebuttal to why they have not performed silencing in <i>P. infestans</i>.

Moreover the vesicles in which particles accumulate do not have the appearance of autophagosomes (they seem more like an aggresome due to overexpression) and this cannot explain the ring-like structure of PexRD54 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). There should be a good control photo showing an autophagosome, probably marked with ATG8CL. We suggest observing the sample expressing both constructs of PexRD54 and ATG8CL for TEM to see both at the autophagosome. Since the autophagosomes induced by PexRD54 have altered morphology (compare <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> to <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), please address the morphology difference in the manuscript. Differences in morphology could also affect quantification. Are the differences the same when overlap is quantified in a 50x50 micron area compared to all puncta found in the area?

Considering the expected quantitative phenotypes, this variation may mask the potential phenotype of PexRD54 silencing. Also, only a few labs managed to stably silence genes in <i>P. infestans</i> and results are typically not readily reproducible, even within individual labs.

This mutant was used as a negative control in ALL functional assays and provided a genetic link between multiple experimental readouts.
