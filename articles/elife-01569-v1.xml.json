Particularly useful have been those organs in which different cell identities and polarities are displayed cell by cell in the cuticle and epidermis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lawrence, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bejsovec and Wieschaus, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Freeman, 1997</a>). Here we use the pattern of larval denticles and muscle attachments and ask how this pattern is maintained and renewed over the larval moult cycles. During larval growth each epidermal cell increases manyfold in size but neither divides nor dies. We follow individuals from moult to moult, tracking marked cells and find that, as cells are repositioned and alter their neighbours, their identities change to compensate and the pattern is conserved. Single cells adopting a new fate may even acquire a new polarity: an identified cell that makes a forward-pointing denticle in the first larval stage may make a backward-pointing denticle in the second and third larval stages."

In the embryo, these cells are tendons and attach to the muscles needed for crawling. Saavedra et al. found that these cells remain attached to the same muscles throughout growth, but that they do not make denticles during the second and third larval stages. Instead, the denticles in the second row of later larval stages are made by other cells, and these new second row cells are not attached to any muscles. In another example of these changes, some cells make denticles that point away from the head during the first larval stage, and then make denticles that point towards the head during later stages. Thus, cells can change both their identity (e.g., whether they are attached to muscles or not) and their orientation (also known as the cell polarity) during the development of a larva."

This suggests that some movement of the pre-denticles may be part of polarity reversal. Also it may be relevant that cell lines I and IV of the embryo are the only lines that make extra lines of cells in the larva, and therefore contribute to convergent extension.

Note that in what follows there are generalisations as accurate as we can make them but, in truth, each segment differs slightly from the next. Sometimes the lines of cells and the denticle rows are incomplete or partially duplicated, occasional cells are difficult to allocate or sit in an ambiguous position. The tendon cells are separated by the two lines of cells that will make denticle rows 3 and 4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a>). The embryonic P compartment is two-cells wide in the anteroposterior axis, the posterior of these two lines of cells making row 1 denticles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,G</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dougan and DiNardo, 1992</a>). In the larva, the arrangement of the cells differs from the embryo in three major respects: first, unlike the tendon cells of the embryo, the tendon cells of the larva do not themselves make denticles. One row of tendon cells is located between denticle rows 1 and 2 and the other between denticle rows 4 and 5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D,F</a>). Second, in the embryo there are two lines of cells between the tendon cells, while in the larva the tendon cells are separated by three lines of cells. Third, in the embryo, the P compartment is two cells wide, but it becomes about four cells wide in the larva (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). These changes occur prior to the L2 stage and clearly involve a reorganisation of the cells that gives a substantial increase in length, along the anteroposterior axis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Nevertheless, in spite of this cell rearrangement, the cuticular pattern is very similar in all the three larval stages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>); suggesting that some cells must be reallocated to different fates during the transition from the embryo to the L2 larva."

In the embryo, the average number of lines of cells found in the anteroposterior axis of this portion was about 14 but it increased to 18 in the pre-L2 larva and remained unchanged thereafter and up to the pre-L3 stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>). Also, the proportions of a fixed rectangular region of the segment changed between embryo and the pre-L3 larva. The ratios of the lengths of the anteroposterior to mediolateral axes were compared; there was a large change in the shape of this rectangle from the embryo to the L2 and L3 larval stages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We measured the shape changes separately in the denticulate and naked cuticle; the cells in these two regions rearranged in a similar way, each one increasing by roughly 2 cells in the anteroposterior axis (data not shown)."

To track the cells in the clones we needed to number the lines of cells (in roman numerals) to distinguish them from the rows of denticles that they contribute to (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). For example, a marked cell might divide and label three cells that belong to line III in the embryo; all such cells would form pre-denticles of row 3. This clone could then be revisited in the pre-L3 to see if the same three cells were still forming row 3 pre-denticles in the larva and ask whether the disposition of these cells in the larva differed from the earlier arrangement in the embryo."

However, since the P compartment is made of two lines of cells in the embryo and four lines of cells in the larva, one extra row has to come from somewhere and line \u2013I is the obvious suspect.

Nearly 30% of line I cells, which all form row 1 denticles in the late embryo and L1, moved forward to contribute to line I\u2019 and most of these produced row 0 denticles in L2 and L3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A and 5</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Are all the row 0 denticles made by cells that originated from line I in the embryo? To test we looked at those line I\u2019 larval cells that do not make denticles. It is possible that any denticle-free gaps in the larval row 0 could be due to line I\u2019 cells in the larva, if they originated from line \u2013I in the embryo. We therefore checked the fate of 29 line \u2013I cells and asked if any went on to make denticles of row 0 (or row 1) in L2 and L3. None of these cells made denticles in the larva and none joined line I\u2019 in the larva (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5 and 4A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

Even so, of 12 cells originating in line I (that made row 1 denticles in the embryo and became line I\u2019 in the larva), 2 failed to make denticles in the larva.

Row 4 denticles point forwards and row 3 denticles point backwards. These cases prove that an identified epidermal cell, even as it grows in size and increases its DNA content without division, can undergo a change in overt polarity during normal larval development. In an experimental situation involving ectopic expression of Dachsous, it was possible to change the polarity of epidermal cells as they developed through the larval stages (<a href=\"#bib38\">Repiso et al., 2010</a>), but a change of polarity as a normal part of development has neither been suspected nor found before."

Similarly cells from lines VI and VII that made rows 6 and 7 denticles in the embryo made rows 5 and 6 denticles in the larva (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C, 4 and 5</a>). Thus their identities change and with a particular bias; for they all make more anterior pattern elements in the larva than they did in the embryo.

The instruments of this change are unknown. It may be relevant however that the expression of the <i>stripe</i> (<i>sr</i>) gene, that drives the differentiation of tendon cells, has two isoforms expressed at different times (<a href=\"#bib45\">Volohonsky et al., 2007</a>). The embryonic tendon cells express the B isoform of <i>sr</i>. Later, in the pre-L1 stage, when the muscles have already attached to the tendon cells and the pre-denticles have been formed, the tendon cells begin to express also the <i>srA</i> isoform (<a href=\"#bib19\">Frommer et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Becker et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Vorbruggen and Jackle, 1997</a>). Perhaps the expression of <i>srA</i> could change the nature of the tendon cells? To test we expressed <i>srA</i> and <i>srB</i> prematurely and ectopically in the early embryo in clones and found that the early expression of either of these forms failed to block the formation of pre-denticles and denticles in L1. However, in the larva, cells in those clones over-expressing either SrA or SrB acquired the actin palisades characteristic of muscle-attached tendon cells in L3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>) and did not form any denticles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). One simple interpretation is that, although <i>sr</i> expression allows denticle formation in the embryo, it blocks denticle formation in the larva."

In <i>Drosophila</i> many experiments suggest that an individual cell\u2019s polarity is not imposed by pervasive forces but depends, locally, on its interactions with its neighbours. For example, wild type cells that are adjacent to a nascent clone of cells lacking the <i>frizzled</i> gene form hairs of reversed polarity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gubb and Garcia-Bellido, 1982</a>). Now we report changes, during normal development, in the polarity of larval cells that do not divide. In both cases it is likely that polarity of a cell is driven by interactions with contacting cells. During development from embryo to larva, we have shown that cells, as a consequence of rearrangement, acquire new neighbours. Moreover, if these new neighbours were to present different amounts of Dachsous or Fat on their abutting membranes, this would lead to different arrangements of heterodimers and consequent polarity changes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ma et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Casal et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Repiso et al., 2010</a>)."

The naming of the rows is done objectively in both L1 and L2/3 but a comparison between the stages is open to various interpretations. Comparison is problematic because we have shown that two lines of cells that make denticles in L1 do not make denticles in L2/3. Since the number of denticle rows is about the same in all three larval stages, it follows that the two replacement denticular rows in L2/3 must be made by cells that either did not have denticular identity in L1, or by cells that contributed to different denticle rows in L1."

Row 2 is so named because it is the next row after row 1. Row 2 in L1, as we and others (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dilks and DiNardo, 2010</a>) have described, is made by the tendon cells, T1. But we show here that, in L2/3, the second row of denticles we now call row 2 is made by the cells lying posterior to T1, and the clones show indubitably that the cells that make this row in L2/3 are different from those that made row 2 in L1. Row 3 is named as the next row back from row 2 in both L1 and L2/3 and and the other rows in sequence, up to and including row 7. Second, the rows are named because of their characteristics. In L1, the rows differ in polarity and also in structure. In L1, most of the denticles are similar, although variable, sizes, but row 5 has clearly larger denticles. However in L2/L3 the rows are more individually sized and can be distinguished on those grounds (e.g., row 3 denticles are small and row 5 denticles particularly large, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In addition we name the rows because of their polarity; the denticles of rows 0, 1 and 4 point forward in all larval stages."

But if we were to rename our row 2 \u2018row 3\u2019 in L2/3 (as he/she suggests) then we would have to rename the more posterior rows and if we were to do that then \u2018row 5\u2019 in L2/3 would point forwards (as row 4 does in all larval stages in our nomenclature) and \u2018row 6\u2019 in L2/3 would have the largest denticles (like row 5 in all larval stages in our nomenclature). These inconsistencies argue against using the reviewer\u2019s alternative nomenclature; in our view all the characteristics of the different denticle rows should be used as objectively as possible to help name them."

If so, it needs to be conserved not only during the evolution of species (<a href=\"#bib31\">McGregor et al., 2007</a>) but also in all the three larval stages of each species. However, conflicting with this need, is the fundamental and atavistic process of convergent extension that, necessarily, causes cell rearrangement. This conflict is resolved by the use of supracellular mechanisms, mechanisms that can build a fixed pattern in a shifting and labile cell population (<a href=\"#bib11\">DiNardo et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Heemskerk and Dinardo, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alexandre et al., 1999</a>). To achieve the same final pattern in spite of cell rearrangement it becomes necessary to drive, as we have found, changes in individual cell identity. We believe that the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo is exceptional because, throughout the growth of these <i>Diptera</i>, the epidermal cells are neither dividing nor dying. This makes our finding that individual cells become reallocated to different fates and polarities particularly eloquent."

To identify the lines of cells labelled, we used a combination of features: the number of rows of pre-denticles, the localisation of the tendon cells and the distinct types of pre-denticles specific for each row. For example, some III cells that did not completely align with each other were still scored as III cells based on their position relative to the tendon cells and also on the size and number of their pre-denticles\u2014usually in the larva, III cells make about four big pre-denticles, whereas cells of line IV tend to form more denticles per cell, but of smaller size."

Around 10 straight lines were then drawn between and perpendicular to the lines <i>ac</i> and <i>bd</i>. The number of cells intersected by these lines was counted and the average of the ten lines used to estimate the number of cells in the A/P axis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). We also measured separately the number of cells in the denticular region (rows 1 to 7 in the embryo and 0 to 6 in the larva) as well as the cells forming the naked cuticle between two denticle belts (comprising the posterior half of the A compartment plus the anterior half of the P compartment in the same segment). For the total number of cells we counted the cells that were, entirely or partially, inside the quadrilateral. For statistical analysis we used the R programming language and software environment (<a href=\"#bib37\">R Core Team, 2013</a>)."

All cells were marked with <i>utrp::GFP</i> and <i>DE-cad::tomato</i>. This allows an excellent resolution of cell outlines and following clone fates.

An alternative interpretation is that embryonic denticle belt 2 is lost (i.e., tendon cells simply stop to make denticles after the molt) and what appears as larval denticle belt 2 is actually embryonic (and larval) denticle belt 3. Similarly, larva could just stop having a denticle belt 5 (T2 cells) and what looks like larval belts 5 and 6 could actually be larval belts 6 and 7 (i.e., belt 5 ceases to exist). This alternative model should be discussed."

It has been defined by both predenticle location and denticle hook orientation. However, it seems that these two properties are not tightly coupled either during normal development or in experimental situations, and so cannot substitute for each other. This situation contrasts with the <i>Drosophila</i> wing, for example, where prehair location and hair orientation seem tightly coupled. Changes in hair polarity in wing cells appear to be consistently preceded by changes in prehair location. This difference makes comparisons between findings on PCP in the embryo/larva with those in adult tissues problematic. I recommend that the authors clarify which specific aspect of cell polarity (denticle orientation, predenticle location) they are discussing, rather than just referring to \u2018cell polarity\u2019 or \u2018PCP\u2019."

Therefore, when a cell\u2019s PCP is altered, it is either because it no longer knows where anterior/posterior are, or, for example, it has confused anterior with posterior. In this worldview, the cell fate change from a row 4 cell to a row 3 cell does not appear to be a change in PCP (despite the change in denticle orientation), as the cell seems always to know the correct direction of anterior and posterior.

Without cell division, how is a single embryonic row able to populate two larval rows? Cell numbers between larval rows do not appear (by eye) to differ greatly. Is there another source of cells for larval rows 3 and 4?"

The authors state that the reviewers\u2019 model is \u2018inviable\u2019; however, I believe that their own interpretation has some problems, and the reviewers\u2019 model may be the more parsimonious. From the paper: \u201cline III cells made only row 3 denticles in L1 but all made row 2 denticles in L3. Similarly cells from lines VI and VII that made rows 6 and 7 denticles in the embryo made rows 5 and 6 denticles in the larva. Thus their identities change and with a particular bias; for they all make more anterior pattern elements in the larva than they did in the embryo\u201d. So the authors show that line III cells make row 3 denticles in L1, but row 2 denticles in L3. They call this a change in identity, presumably because \u2018row 3\u2019 cells have become \u2018row 2\u2019 cells (the name has changed). However, in both L1 and L3, line III cells are two cells posterior to the compartment boundary, immediately posterior to a tendon cell and produce a posterior pointing denticle. How is the identity changed? In what way have the cells taken a \u2018more anterior\u2019 identity? Similar questions can be asked about the identity of Line VI and VII cells."

The authors\u2019 view, in which most cells within the denticle belt change to a more anterior identity between L1 and L3, would indeed suggest the involvement of supracellular mechanisms that can redefine cell identity across the denticle belt. In contrast, the reviewers\u2019 model would only require local changes in cell morphology, for example, tendon cells stop producing denticles, that would probably not require supracellular patterning mechanisms. I think the authors should discuss the reviewers' model further rather than labeling it inviable."

Although the authors consider this idea \u2018inviable\u2019, it is, in my view, plausible (I think I understand the power of cell tracking using clones). Perhaps this discussion is semantic and due to different ideas of cell fate (i.e., is any change of how a cell behaves at two different times of development a change in cell fate?). Of course, I agree with the authors that the case for row IV' cells that revert their polarity with respect to the A/P axis is entirely different."

Wg is essential for the patterning, without Wg the denticle belts do not form. In short, there are hundreds of papers on these supracellular mechanisms but they are nearly all concerned with the embryo.

As for the specification of the individual denticle rows there are fewer papers, but those by DiNardo and colleagues and by Alexandre et al., to which we refer, are concerned with the embryo, the development of the L1 cuticle and the mechanisms that contribute to making its 6 rows of denticles."

Another complication is that cells that make row 2 in L1 make no contribution to denticle rows in the L2; this means that the cells that make row 2 in L2 and L3 have to be found from the others, and therefore mean that the total number of rows of cells increases in the denticular region by more than the one referred to (embryonic row 4) by the reviewer.
