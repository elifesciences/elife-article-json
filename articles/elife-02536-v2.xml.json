In this study, we show in awake mice at rest that spiking activity of Purkinje cells, the sole output cells of the cerebellar cortex, differs between cerebellar modules and correlates with their expression of the glycolytic enzyme aldolase C or zebrin. Simple spike and complex spike frequencies were significantly higher in Purkinje cells located in zebrin-negative than zebrin-positive modules. The difference in simple spike frequency persisted when the synaptic input to, but not intrinsic activity of, Purkinje cells was manipulated. Blocking TRPC3, the effector channel of a cascade of proteins that have zebrin-like distribution patterns, attenuated the simple spike frequency difference. Our results indicate that zebrin-discriminated cerebellar modules operate at different frequencies, which depend on activation of TRPC3, and that this property is relevant for all cerebellar functions."

In this study, we show in awake mice at rest that spiking activity of Purkinje cells, the sole output cells of the cerebellar cortex, differs between cerebellar modules and correlates with their expression of the glycolytic enzyme aldolase C or zebrin. Simple spike and complex spike frequencies were significantly higher in Purkinje cells located in zebrin-negative than zebrin-positive modules. The difference in simple spike frequency persisted when the synaptic input to, but not intrinsic activity of, Purkinje cells was manipulated. Blocking TRPC3, the effector channel of a cascade of proteins that have zebrin-like distribution patterns, attenuated the simple spike frequency difference. Our results indicate that zebrin-discriminated cerebellar modules operate at different frequencies, which depend on activation of TRPC3, and that this property is relevant for all cerebellar functions."

This pattern is seen throughout the cerebellum, and is evident even when the positive and negative cells are neighbors, which indicates that these differences do not simply reflect differences in the locations of the cells or differences in the inputs they receive from parallel fibers. Additional experiments revealed that the distinct firing rates are likely not generated by zebrin itself, but rather by proteins that are expressed alongside zebrin, most notably those that work through an ion channel called TRPC3."

The unique cyto-architecture of the cerebellum is characterized by the crystalline matrix of its sagittally oriented PC dendrites and climbing fibers and its orthogonally running parallel fibers (<a href=\"#bib27\">Larsell, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Voogd, 2011</a>). The ubiquitous nature of this relatively simple matrix throughout all lobules and modules of the cerebellar cortex made scientists predict in 1967 that this neuronal machine was probably the first to be elucidated (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eccles, 1967</a>). Yet, about half a century later, we have collected a wealth of information about the molecular and physiological identity of the various cell types in the cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>), but gross structure\u2013function relations are still largely lacking. For example, the amount of evidence for physiological differences within the cerebellar cortex is limited and there is little comparative analysis of spiking activity throughout the cerebellar cortex in adult awake animals. In fact, even most slice physiology studies do not discriminate between lobules or modules, indicative of the fact that the cerebellum is still considered physiologically homogeneous."

                        "text": "At the same time, several molecular markers have been identified that can subdivide the cerebellar cortex into distinct bands (<a href=\"#bib3\">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</a>). The best-known of these molecules are the zebrins, which are highly expressed by specific bands of Purkinje cells (PCs), that is the sole output of the cerebellar cortex. Immunostainings for both zebrin I and II give rise to symmetric stripes that are oriented perpendicular to the cerebellar folds (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brochu et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Leclerc et al., 1990</a>). The combined presence of zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative PCs can be found in all vertebrate classes, and zebra-like patterns are present in the cerebellum of birds and mammals, varying from pigeons and mice up to monkeys and humans (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brochu et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sillitoe et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Marzban and Hawkes, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Graham and Wylie, 2012</a>). In most cases, adjacent PCs with zebrin II (from hereon referred to as zebrin) are located in the same bands, receive CF inputs from the same part of the inferior olive, and project their axons to the same part of the cerebellar nuclei (<a href=\"#bib48\">Voogd and Ruigrok, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pijpers et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sugihara et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sugihara, 2011</a>). Moreover, although their various terminal rosettes may be located in different parts of the cerebellar cortex, individual mossy fibers often also adhere to the same zebrin signature (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pijpers et al., 2006</a>). As such zebrin may be regarded as a biomarker linking different cerebellar cortical zones, potentially binding activity of different olivo-cerebellar modules and mossy fiber systems (<a href=\"#bib48\">Voogd and Ruigrok, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pijpers et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ruigrok, 2011</a>). However, what the basic characteristics of this zebrin-related activity might be is unknown. Since zebrin has been identified as the glycolytic enzyme aldolase C, its presence might in principle be linked to the level of metabolic and/or electrophysiological activity. Indeed, the distribution of zebrin in the cerebellum is similar to that of the excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (EAAT4) and complementary to splice variant b of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1b) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dehnes et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mateos et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</a>). Intracellularly, several proteins in a molecular cascade linked to mGluR1 are also expressed in zebrin-like bands, including the IP3-receptor (<a href=\"#bib16\">Furutama et al., 2010</a>), PLC\u03b23/4 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sarna et al., 2006</a>), PKC\u03b4 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barmack et al., 2000</a>), and NCS-1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jinno et al., 2003</a>). This cascade controls the activity of the transient receptor potential cation channel type C3 (TRPC3) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hartmann et al., 2008</a>), which in turn can influence the firing activity of PCs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sekerkova et al., 2013</a>). We hypothesized that differential activity of this cascade of proteins with zebrin-related expression might lead to differential activity of their effector channel, TRPC3, and thereby to differences in simple spike (SS) firing frequency between modules (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2012b</a>)."

Purkinje cells were identified by the presence of SSs and CSs and the consistent presence of a pause in SS firing after a CS (i.e., climbing fiber pause) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013F</a>). Recordings that were used for analysis had to meet several criteria including a minimum duration of 120 s, stable spike amplitude over the whole recording period and no detectable tissue damage in a 400-\u00b5m radius (see also <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Following perfusion of the animals and processing of their cerebella, the zebrin-negative (Z\u2212) and zebrin-positive (Z+) zones were identified by immunostaining. Of the 104 PCs included in the analysis (50 mice), 47 and 57 cells were located in Z\u2212 and Z+ zones, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, plot adapted from <a href=\"#bib43\">Sugihara and Quy, 2007</a>). The SS firing frequency was significantly higher in Z\u2212 zones than in Z+ zones (Z\u2212: 96.1 \u00b1 15.4 Hz, Z+: 61.4 \u00b1 19.3 Hz, <i>t</i> = 9.942, p&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). In line with this the climbing fiber pause was also significantly longer (<i>t</i> = \u22127.482, p&lt;0.001) in Z+ zones (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>) (see also <a href=\"#bib35\">Paukert et al., 2010</a>). Both the SS firing frequency, SS regularity and CS firing frequency were stable over time (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast to the SS firing frequency and climbing fiber pause, the waveform and regularity of SSs did not consistently depend on zebrin identity in that average half-width and mean coefficient of variation for adjacent intervals (CV2) were not significantly different between Z\u2212 and Z+ PCs (half-width: <i>t</i> = \u22121.133, p=0.260, data not shown; CV2: <i>t</i> = 1.197, p=0.234) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013J</a>)."

Hence, one could argue that the difference between Z+ and Z\u2212 is related to location, rather than directly linked with zebrin identity. Re-plotting the results, but now color-coded for simple spike frequency to facilitate individual comparisons, seems to largely contradict this possibility (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To more thoroughly test our hypothesis that differences are indeed related to zebrin identity, we also attempted to record neighboring, online identified, Z+ and Z\u2212 PCs in a single experiment. To this end, we performed two-photon imaging in vivo in awake, head-fixed mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the EAAT4 promoter in a pattern similar to that of zebrin (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gincel et al., 2007</a>). In the dorsal layer of lobule V, VI, and Crus I we identified Z+ and Z\u2212 bands and recorded PCs in adjacent zebrin bands (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). In line with our hypothesis, we observed higher simple spike activity in Z\u2212 than in Z+ Purkinje cells (Z+: 36.0 \u00b1 15.5 Hz, n = 8; Z\u2212: 75.8 \u00b1 19.5 Hz, n = 9; <i>t</i> = 4.618, p&lt;0.001) and concommitant longer climbing fiber pauses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In contrast to the immunohistochemically subdivided PC dataset (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), that covers the entire cerebellar cortex, this spatially restricted dataset did show a difference in simple spike regularity, suggesting that variations in regularity may occur more locally."

                                "text": "Reduced tonic SS activity of PCs at rest, as observed in Z+ modules, will lead to enhanced activity of the GABAergic neurons in the cerebellar nuclei that inhibit inferior olivary neurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, one can expect the CS activity that results from activity in the climbing fibers originating in the inferior olive to be reduced as well. This prediction indeed holds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The CS activity of immunostaining identified Z+ PCs was significantly lower than that in Z\u2212 PCs (same PCs as described in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013J</a>; Z\u2212: 1.13 \u00b1 0.25 Hz, Z+: 0.92 \u00b1 0.28 Hz, <i>t</i> = 3.926, p&lt;0.001). This difference persisted in the subset of two-photon imaging identified Z+ and Z\u2212 PCs recorded in lobule V\u2013VI and Crus I, supporting the link to zebrin-identity, rather than cortical location (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Moreover, the gradual trend that we observed for SS firing frequency, but not for CV2, in the different lobules in both the vermis and hemispheres was also observed for CS activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since climbing fibers evoked prolonged EPSCs in Z+ Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Paukert et al., 2010</a>), we also investigated the half-width of the first upward deflection in potential and the integrated deviation of the CS potential from zero. Both parameters were significantly higher in immunostaining identified Z+ PCs (half-width: <i>t</i> = \u22123.269, p=0.001, spike area: <i>t</i> = \u22122.523, p=0.013) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Given that SS activity and the wave of CS activity correlated with zebrin, the distribution of post-CS configurations of SS activity might in principle also be affected (<a href=\"#bib42\">Simpson et al., 1996</a>). Based on the peri-CS time histograms, we could distinguish four different types of SS responses following the climbing fiber pause. These included a neutral pattern (i.e., normal type), a pattern with increased SS activity (i.e., facilitation type), and two patterns with decreased SS activity, one without and one with a superimposed oscillatory effect (i.e., suppression and oscillation type, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Thus, if there is a relation with zebrin expression, one could predict that the facilitation type of cells prevail in the Z\u2212 zones, whereas the suppression and oscillation type of cells occur predominantly in the Z+ zones. This prediction did hold. Even though the normal type dominated in both Z\u2212 and Z+ PCs, the suppression and oscillation types only occurred in Z+ PCs. The facilitation type occurred in both Z\u2212 and Z+ PCs, but significantly more in the Z\u2212 areas (Z\u2212: 17 /47, Z+: 6/57; <i>\u03c7</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> = 9.835, p=0.002, Pearson's Chi-squared test) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Attempts to find other parameters correlating with the response type were largely unsuccessful, except for the oscillation type, which showed a combination of low SS frequency and low CV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>)."

This raises the question as to what extent the difference in SS firing frequency between Z+ and Z\u2212 PCs results from differences in input or intrinsic activity. We used two approaches to tackle this question. First, we completely removed the impact of external inputs onto the PCs using blockers for AMPA, NMDA, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors during cell-attached recordings from sagittal slices (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The average SS firing frequency was, on average, 22 \u00b1 7% lower over all lobules in vitro than that in vivo indicating that the larger part of SS activity is internally driven by PCs. The dominant impact of intrinsic PC activity was also reflected by the finding that the differential firing frequency pattern over all lobules in vitro correlated with that in vivo (<i>r</i> = 0.916, p=0.010, Pearson's correlation) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). For example, the in vitro SS firing frequency of PCs in lobules III, which are predominantly Z\u2212, was alike the in vivo recordings significantly higher than that in lobule X, where PCs are Z+ (<i>t</i> = 2.844, p=0.007). This higher firing frequency in lobule III was associated with a higher intrinsic excitability in lobule III compared to lobule X, reinforcing the interpretation that the difference is predominantly intrinsic to Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (see also <a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2012a</a>). To confirm that under these in vitro conditions, without excitatory or inhibitory input, the difference in simple spike firing frequency still correlates with zebrin identity, we also recorded the activity of fluorescence-identified Z+ and Z\u2212 PCs in adjacent bands in slices from the EAAT4-eGFP mice. Comparison of sets from lobules II\u2013V and lobule VIII\u2013IX confirmed this presumption (II\u2013V: <i>t</i> = 2.910, p=0.017; VIII\u2013IX: <i>t</i> = 2.352, p=0.043) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

These differences held true for lobules I\u2013III (in vitro: <i>t</i> = 32.647; <i>a6-Cacna1a</i>: <i>t</i> = 5.613, p&lt;0.001; <i>PC-\u0394\u03b32</i>: <i>t</i> = 3.068, p=0.003 vs <i>in vivo</i> wild-types), as well as for lobule X (in vitro: <i>t</i> = 14.593, p&lt;0.001; <i>a6-Cacna1a</i>: <i>t</i> = 2.062, p=0.046; <i>PC-\u0394\u03b32</i>: <i>t</i> = 3.292, p=0.002).

This may be particularly relevant as zebrin, or aldolase C, is a glycolytic enzyme and probably plays a secondary role via energy consumption without a direct impact on the electrophysiological properties of PCs. In fact, when the products of aldolase C, that is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), were introduced to the ACSF in our in vitro recordings, SS firing increased in both the largely zebrin-negative lobule III and zebrin-positive lobule X (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), arguing against the possibility that aldolase C's enzymatic function directly contributes to a lower SS firing frequency in Z+ PCs. Hence, we shifted our focus to TRPC3, which can be associated with zebrin-negative PCs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mateos et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hartmann and et al, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2012b</a>), and underlies the mGluR1-mediated slow EPSCs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hartmann and et al, 2008</a>) and mGluR1-agonist (DHPG)-induced currents (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nelson and Glitsch, 2012</a>), that have been shown to affect SS activity even in the absence of synaptic input (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yamakawa and Hirano, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Coesmans et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chanda and Xu-Friedman, 2011</a>). We first tested the effect of blocking TRPC3 on the activity of PCs in vitro in lobules III and X, in the absence of synaptic input, using two blockers, genistein and Pyr3 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kiyonaka et al., 2009</a>). Both TRPC3 blockers had a significant impact on PC activity reducing the firing frequency in lobule III (genistein, p&lt;0.001; Pyr3, p&lt;0.001 vs vehicle control, one-way followed by Tukey's post-hoc test) without a significant effect in lobule X (p=0.271 and p=1.000 vs vehicle respectively, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), an effect that is in line with that of blocking mGluR1 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yamakawa and Hirano, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Coesmans et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chanda and Xu-Friedman, 2011</a>). To more directly compare the effect of blocking TRPC3 between lobule III and X, we recorded PC activity during wash-in of the blockers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Wash-in of Pyr3 had a robust effect on SS firing frequency of PCs in lobule III (pre: 49.9 \u00b1 7.9 Hz; post: 25.5 \u00b1 9.9 Hz; <i>t</i> = 5.412, p=0.002, paired Student's <i>t</i> test) and this effect was significantly larger than that in lobule X (reduction, lobule III: 48.2 \u00b1 19.7%; lobule X: 8.5 \u00b1 16.6%; <i>t</i> = 4.069, p=0.002) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>)."

If this difference in enzymatic activity is responsible for the difference in simple spike activity between Z+ and Z\u2013 Purkinje cells, addition of the reaction products of zebrin should decrease the activity of Zebrin-negative Purkinje cells in lobule III. Simultaneous application of 250 \u00b5M of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) caused a subtle but significant increase in simple spike activity in both lobule X and lobule III (X: p&lt;0.001; III: p=0.019 vs vehicle, One-Way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc tests).

As zebrin, as a biomarker, can be associated with the modular organization of the olivo-cortico-nuclear circuit (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brochu et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Voogd et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pijpers et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2007</a>), our results indicate that Purkinje cells within the same module operate around a preferred range of intrinsically determined SS firing frequencies and that this activity is different from modules with a different zebrin identity. Moreover, presumably as a secondary effect, CS activity is also altered. Since the differences were consistently found throughout the entire cerebellar cortex, these findings have direct consequences for all cerebellar functions and the coding schemes they can engage."

Although we cannot exclude the possibility that lobule-specific effects contribute to the observed differences in simple and complex spike firing frequency, the results obtained in EAAT4-eGFP mice in vivo and in vitro argue against a contribution of their rostro-caudal or lobular location. The difference in SS firing frequency is probably largely determined by the intrinsic properties of PCs, as this difference was maintained in the reduced slice preparation, in which the inputs are blocked, as well as in mouse mutants, in which the excitatory (<i>a6-Cacna1a</i> mice) or inhibitory (<i>PC-\u0394\u03b32</i> mice) inputs are attenuated. Comparing the PC activity in zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative PCs per transverse zone confirmed its link to zebrin-identity, but also revealed a more subtle difference within the population of zebrin-positive PCs. These differences could be lobule-specific and/or originate from differences in input, in more subtle variations in zebrin or its related proteins or even in the expression pattern of other proteins. It should be noted, however, that blocking TRPC3 shifts the activity of Z\u2212 PCs towards that of Z+ PCs, indicating that the potential differences within the group of Z+ PCs do not affect our conclusions."

                                "text": "In contrast, the level of regularity of firing (i.e., CV2) was not consistently dependent on zebrin identity, but significantly altered by impairing the excitatory and/or inhibitory inputs. In line with the notion that reduced SS activity of PCs, as observed in the zebrin-positive modules, should lead to enhanced firing of the GABAergic neurons in the cerebellar nuclei and thereby to reduced activity in the inferior olivary neurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</a>), we found that CS activity induced by activity of olivary climbing fibers was reduced in zebrin-positive PCs. In fact, reduction of simple spike frequency in lobule III in vivo for several minutes to hours by Pyr3 application also reduced complex spike frequency, supporting the indirect control of simple spikes on complex spike activity. Interestingly, temporary increases in climbing fiber-evoked CS activity suppress SS frequency providing a homeostatic control mechanism within an olivocerebellar module (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mathews et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Coddington et al., 2013</a>). Thus, whereas the external inputs to PCs may control the precise temporal coding of SS activity at rest as well as the firing frequency and dynamic range during natural sensory stimulation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Badura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Galliano et al., 2013</a>), their intrinsic properties appear to determine the baseline frequencies of SSs as well as CSs at rest, around which they can operate."

                                "text": "These findings raise the question which proteins in the zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative zones may actually determine the difference in intrinsic firing frequencies of their PCs. Since zebrin's enzymatic reaction products did not underlay the differences in SS firing frequency, we shifted our attention to other proteins that are expressed in pattern similar or complementary to that of zebrin. We targeted EAAT4 that is expressed in a pattern similar to that of zebrin, and TRPC3, the effector channel of a cascade of proteins that has zebrin-like expression patterns (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dehnes et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mateos et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</a>). Although blocking EAAT4 in vitro had no detectable effect on SS firing frequency, blocking TRPC3 reduced SS activity in lobule III (largely zebrin-negative), but not in lobule X (zebrin-positive), both in vitro and in vivo. It should be noted that, although TRPC3 gene expression appears to vary from anterior to posterior with higher levels in the anterior, largely zebrin-negative, lobules (Allen Brain Atlas, <a href=\"http://www.brain-map.org\">www.brain-map.org</a>), there is no immunohistochemical evidence for differences in protein levels (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hartmann and et al, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Becker et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sekerkova et al., 2013</a>). If the expression of TRPC3 is indeed homogeneous throughout the cerebellum, the differential effect of blocking TRPC3 suggests that its activity might be higher in Z\u2212 PCs. Two mutually non-exclusive mechanisms could contribute to this difference in activity. First, several proteins in the molecular cascade related to TRPC3 are expressed in zebrin-like bands, including the IP3-receptor (<a href=\"#bib16\">Furutama et al., 2010</a>) (TRPC3 modulator [<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2012b</a>]), PLC\u03b23/4 [<a href=\"#bib39\">Sarna et al., 2006</a>] (TRPC3 activator [<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2012b</a>]), PKC\u03b4 [<a href=\"#bib5\">Barmack et al., 2000</a>], and NCS-1 [<a href=\"#bib23\">Jinno et al., 2003</a>]. In fact, zebrin II or aldolase C, which is not likely to be involved via its enzymatic function, bears the capacity to bind IP3 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baron et al., 1999</a>), and thus could potentially reduce the activation of TRPC3 in Z+ PCs, through the IP3-receptor. At the same time, mGluR1 subtype b is expressed in a pattern complementary to that of zebrin (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mateos et al., 2001</a>), and it has been shown that mGluR1 can be tonically activated, that mGlurR1 blockers can reduce SS firing frequency (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yamakawa and Hirano, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Coesmans et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chanda and Xu-Friedman, 2011</a>), and that mGluR1-evoked depolarizing currents can be blocked with TRPC3-selective blockers (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kiyonaka et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2012b</a>). However, the possibility that an alternative pathway, independent of mGluR1, leads to TRPC3 activition cannot be excluded. Knowledge of this pathway of proteins and their exact interactions is at current presumably incomplete and beyond the scope of this study. The findings that the expression patterns of mGluR1b, PLC\u03b2, PKC\u03b4, and IP3R1, all of which are key proteins in calcium release from intracellular calcium stores, are linked to cerebellar modules (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mateos et al., 2001</a>) and intimately connected with TRPC3, provokes the speculation that this entire pathway contributes to the difference in SS activity between zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative PCs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hartmann and et al, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Becker et al., 2009</a>)."

Interestingly, the low and high baseline frequencies of zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative PCs also appear to be in line with their propensities for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), respectively (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Thus, PCs operating at lower frequencies may be preferentially potentiated, whereas PCs with higher SS firing frequency may have less \u2018space\u2019 for increasing the firing rate and may be more prone to express LTD. Likewise, entrainment of cerebellar nuclei neurons by synchronized SS input from PCs, which results in phase-locking of connected neurons, may occur at 50\u201380 Hz, but is impaired at 100 Hz (<a href=\"#bib36\">Person and Raman, 2012</a>). If correct, this mechanism predicts that the phase-locking mechanism is engaged in contacts between zebrin-positive PCs and cerebellar nuclei neurons, whereas those involved in zebrin-negative zones may be more prone for rebound excitation, which follows strong forms of inhibition (<a href=\"#bib13\">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Person and Raman, 2012</a>)."

This implies that PC input to cerebellar nuclei neurons may be segregated on the basis of frequency, and that as a consequence the output of cerebellar nuclei neurons located within zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative territories may be distinctly different. Although this remains speculative at this stage, similar phenomena have been described for highly active neurons in cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yassin et al., 2010</a>) and hyperpolarization-activated currents in affiliated olfactory bulb mitral neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Angelo et al., 2012</a>). Combined with the zebrin- or lobule-related prevalence of plasticity mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wang et al., 2011</a>), our results suggest that the biochemically identified bands in the structurally homogenous cerebellar cortex are physiologically different with distinct biophysical signatures that probably have significant implications downstream in the cerebellar nuclei and thereby on motor behaviour and cognition."

Mice were prepared for recordings by placing an immobilizing construct (pedestal) and a craniotomy on their skulls (<a href=\"#bib4\">Badura et al., 2013</a>). In short, the skin over the skull was shaven, and opened along the rostro-caudal midline. Using Optibond (Kerr, Salerno, Italy) and Charisma (Heraeus Kulzer, Hesse, Germany), a U-shaped holder (6 \u00d7 4 mm) with a magnet inside (4 \u00d7 4 mm, MTG, Weilbach, Germany) was fixed on the skull, overlying the frontal and parietal bones. Next, the medial neck muscles overlying the occipital bone were removed, a craniotomy was made over the interparietal or occipital bone and a recording chamber was placed around it, allowing in vivo electrophysiological recordings throughout different areas in the cerebellum of awake mice. The exact location of the craniotomy depended on the target area, see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for details. After recovery of &gt;24 hr, mice were head-fixed to a bar, their bodies restrained in a custom-made plastic tube and the dura was opened to facilitate the recording of extracellular Purkinje cell activity, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hoebeek et al., 2005</a>). Electrophysiological activity in the cerebellar cortex was recorded using double barrel borosilicate glass pipettes (theta septum, 1.5 OD, 1.02 ID, WPI, FL, USA). To do so, one of the barrels was opened laterally, approximately 10 mm from the taper, to allow entrance of the electrode wire and sealed with glass glue at the back. The other barrel was filled with a blue dye (Alcian Blue, 0.1\u20130.2% solution in saline; Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The recording half of the double barrel pipettes were filled with 2 M NaCl-solution, and had a tip size of 3\u20136 \u03bcm, respectively. Pipettes were advanced into the cerebellum with an oil micro-drive (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) and signals were pre-amplified (custom-made preamplifier, 1000x DC), filtered (CyberAmp 320, Axon, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), digitized (Power1401, CED, Cambridge, UK), and stored for offline analysis. After successful recordings, brief pressure pulses were delivered through the other barrel of the electrode, using a custom-built device, to mark the recording site. To obtain <i>a6-Cacna1a</i> and <i>PC-\u0394\u03b32</i> mice, we used the Cre/loxP system to delete exon 4 of the gene coding for the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (<i>Cacna1a</i>) selectively from granule cells and exon 4 of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor \u03b32 subunit gene (<i>Gabrg2</i>) selectively from PCs, respectively, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wulff et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Galliano et al., 2013</a>). In short, we crossed <i>Cacna1a</i><sup><i>lox/lox</i></sup> mice with Gabra6::Cre (or \u0394a6::cre) mice (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aller et al., 2003</a>) and <i>Gabrg2</i><sup><i>lox/lox</i></sup> mice with Pcp2::Cre (or L7::Cre) mice (<a href=\"#bib33\">Oberdick et al., 1990</a>), respectively. From the offspring, that was heterozygous for the floxed genes (i.e., <i>Cacna1a</i><sup><i>lox/+</i></sup> and <i>Gabrg2</i><sup><i>lox/+</i></sup>), Cre-negative males were crossed with Cre-positive females to generate, amongst others, \u0394a6::cre;Cacna1a<sup>lox/lox</sup> (or <i>Cacna1a</i><sup><i>\u0394/\u0394</i></sup>, here named <i>a6-Cacna1a</i>) and Pcp2::cre;gabrg2<sup>lox/lox</sup> (or <i>Gabrg2</i><sup><i>\u0394/\u0394</i></sup>, here named <i>PC-\u0394\u03b32</i>) mice, respectively. Both lines were maintained in a C57Bl6 background. In the experiments with mutant mice and blocker injections, double and single barrel (2.0 mm OD, 1.16 mm ID, Harvard Apparatus, MA, USA) borosilicate glass pipettes were used, and alcian blue was injected to confirm that the recordings were from lobules I\u2013III or X."

SpikeTrain uses wave clustering to identify simple and complex spikes, and in case of doubt manual checking (and correcting) would be performed. For each cell the firing rate, CV and mean CV2 were determined for simple and complex spikes, as well as the climbing fiber pause. CV is the standard deviation of inter-spike intervals (ISI) divided by the mean, the mean CV2 is calculated as the mean of 2\u00b7|(ISI)<sub>n+1</sub>\u2212ISI<sub>n</sub>|/(ISI<sub>n+1</sub> + ISI<sub>n</sub>). Both are measures for the regularity of the firing, with CV reflecting that of the entire recording and mean CV2 that of adjacent intervals, making the latter a measure of regularity on small timescales. The climbing fiber pause is determined as the minimum duration between a complex spike and the following simple spike. To extend this analysis, we also plotted histograms of simple spike activity time locked on the complex spike, and labelled the shape of this time histogram as normal, facilitation, suppression, and oscillation (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> for examples). The spike characteristics half maximum width (HMW) and spike area were determined from the normalized average signal of simple and complex spikes of individual recordings. Half-width was calculated as the width of the first peak at half of its maximum amplitude.

Purkinje cells were identified using visual guidance by DIC video microscopy and water-immersion 40X objective (Axioskop 2 FS plus; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Slices were transferred to the recording chamber and incubated for at least 10 min before starting the recordings. We recorded the Purkinje cell activity in cell-attached mode (0 pA injection) at 33.0 \u00b1 1.0\u00b0C, with a distance of 0.5 cm between temperature probe and slice. Current clamp recordings were performed with the same setting as cell-attached recording, except that pipettes were filled with intracellular solution contains the following (in mM): 120 K-Gluconate, 9 KCl, 10 KOH, 3.48 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.4 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, and 17.5 sucrose, pH 7.25 and Osm 295."

The typical signal-to-noise ratio was larger than 5:1, and minimum recording duration was 120 s, unless stated otherwise. Cells were included based on the following criteria: (1) the CV over the whole period of recording was &lt;0.2; (2) the average frequency changed less than 20% between the first and the last (30 s), except for those in the wash-in experiment. To minimize the day-to-day and slice-to-slice variations, recordings were targeted at different lobules for every slice. For the Pyr3 wash-in experiment, firing frequencies were normalized to the average frequency over the 2-min period before adding the drug to the ACSF (pre). The wash-in effect was determined by calculating the firing frequency in the period of 5\u20137 min after the drug was in the recording chamber (post)."

After injection, extracellular Purkinje cell activity was recorded as described above, and alcian blue was injected to verify that the recordings were from lobules I-III or X. The minimum recording duration was 60 s and recordings were made for up to 4 hr after injection for these experiments. For in vitro experiments all blockers were prepared in 1:1000 stock solutions in DMSO, stored at \u221220\u00b0C and used within 4 weeks after preparation. Blockers were bath applied where indicated in the following concentrations: DL-TBOA (25 \u03bcM), genistein (10 \u03bcM), and Pyr3 (100 \u03bcM). Except for the wash-in experiments, all recordings started after the slice was incubated in the drug-containing ASCF for at least 15 min. In the cases where we observed an effect in the wash-in experiments, the firing frequency of Purkinje cells typically dropped the moment the drug reached the bath, an effect maximizing within a few minutes and sometimes followed by a smaller recovery. The experimenter was blind to the presence and type of drug applied until analysis was completed. The tubing was changed after every blocker experiment."

If the same injection could be found in several slices, the injection was allocated to the slice with the highest density of Alcian Blue. If the injection site was at the border of two cerebellar lobules, the cell was allocated to the most rostral lobule. Particularly in the hemipsheres, a distinction between positive and lightly positive areas can be made. In this study, they were taken together as positive, and compared to the\u2014clearly identifiable\u2014negative bands. Recordings were excluded from further analysis if there was clear tissue damage within a circle with a radius of 400 \u00b5m around the injection site. The recording sites of 7 out 8 cells in the flocculus (FL) were confirmed by the response to visual stimulation instead of histology (<a href=\"#bib17\">Galliano et al., 2013</a>). Example sections and sections used to determine the staining intensity of zebrin II were photographed using a Leica DMRB microscope equipped with Leica DC300 camera. To compare zebrin intensity between lobules the average pixel intensity of the PC somas in each lobule was determined using ImageJ software, based on the average of a total of 3 sections for vermis and 2 sections for the hemisphere per mouse, from 3 mice. Sections compared in the same panel, were processed in parallel. To correct for minor differences in overall staining intensity between vermis and hemispheres, soma intensities were normalized based on background (granule cell layer) intensity."

One of these properties, simple spike firing rate, can be reduced in some (anterior) modules by blocking TRPC3 channels. The mapping of physiological heterogeneity of the oft-assumed homogenous Purkinje cell population onto different cerebellar regions, and the proposed role for TRPC3 in this difference is potentially quite interesting. However, as written, it could appear that the paper focuses on the stronger conclusion that the differences across regions are determined by zebrin banding. Here the arguments are weaker for two major reasons. 1) The zebrin&gt;mGluR1b&gt;TRPC3 assumption is indirect. 2) The evidence that zebrin identity is the key predictor of Purkinje cell physiology is not convincing and premature. This is especially confusing because the authors eliminate zebrinII itself as the determinant. Please change the presentation to avoid this problem.

Even though the link between zebrin (as a biomarker) and mGluR1b is strong, in that the distribution of mGluR1b is complementary to that of zebrin (see Mateos et al., 2001), we agree with the reviewers that the connection from mGluR1b to TRPC3 in term of expression is less clear, and other proteins could very well be involved here. In this manuscript we provide evidence supporting a significant contribution of TRPC3 to the difference in simple spike frequency, but there is no evidence, as far as we know, that the expression of TRPC3 is complementary to that of zebrin. We agree that the link between zebrin and TRPC3 is therefore indirect, and want to make clear that we believe that the evidence for the zebrin hypothesis comes from the experimental data, linking PC activity to zebrin identity (including newly added results). We have toned down the text in the Introduction and Discussion sections regarding the link, and clarify that there is no evidence for a pattern in the expression pattern of TRPC3 other than that in the Allen Brain Atlas."

We have discussed this issue with colleagues from other labs, and they confirmed that the TRPC3 antibody quality is suboptimal. In the end, we were not confident in the results. But, even though we fully agree with the reviewers that it is an interesting question, we do not believe this to be absolutely essential for the current study. If TRPC3 is not expressed in bands, the differential effect of blocking TRPC3 suggests that there are differences in the expression and/or activity of other proteins that are directly linked to TRPC3 or its pathway. This has been shown for several proteins in this cascade, including e.g. IP3R1, PLCbeta3/4, PKCdelta and mGluR1b. This point is now also addressed in the Discussion."

In vivo we recorded 17 cells (Z+: n=8; Z\u2212: n=9) in lobules V-VI and Crus I, and confirmed the difference between Z+ and Z\u2212 PCs (Z+, 36.0 \u00b1 15.5; Z\u2212, 75.8 \u00b1 19.5, <i>t</i> = 4.618, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In addition, we performed recordings in slices of EAAT4-eGFP mice in two areas that we were not able to reach by two-photon imaging. We obtained recordings from 11 cells (7 vs. 4) in lobules II-V and 11 cells (6 vs. 5) in lobules VIII-IX, that again confirm the difference (II-V: Z+, 30.9\u00b1 3.4; Z\u2212, 67.5 \u00b1 34.4, <i>t</i> = 2.910, <i>p</i>= 0.017; VIII-IX: Z+, 35.4 \u00b1 9.2; Z-, 55.1 \u00b1 18.0, <i>t</i> = 2.352, <i>p</i> = 0.043). These results are now described in a separate Results paragraph and presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A-C</a> (in vivo), <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> (in vivo) and added to <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, as panel C (in vitro). Together the in vivo and in vitro results cover nearly the entire vermal cortex. The fact that the differences in simple spike frequency between Z+ and Z\u2212 PCs persist in each comparison in these new experiments, as well as in the previously presented comparisons per transverse zone (with new two-photon data added, new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), we believe, argues strongly against their dependence on lobular location, and instead indicates that they correlate with the zebrin identity of the PC."
