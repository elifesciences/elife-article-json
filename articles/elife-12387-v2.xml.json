Hallmarks of the multi-polar state are large fluctuations in microtubule-based transport into and outgrowth of different neurites, although what drives these fluctuations remains elusive. We show that actin waves, which stochastically migrate from the cell body towards neurite tips, direct microtubule-based transport during the multi-polar state. Our data argue for a mechanical control system whereby actin waves transiently widen the neurite shaft to allow increased microtubule polymerization to direct Kinesin-based transport and create bursts of neurite extension. Actin waves also require microtubule polymerization, arguing that positive feedback links these two components. We propose that actin waves create large stochastic fluctuations in microtubule-based transport and neurite outgrowth, promoting competition between neurites as they explore the environment until sufficient external cues can direct one to become the axon."

Hallmarks of the multi-polar state are large fluctuations in microtubule-based transport into and outgrowth of different neurites, although what drives these fluctuations remains elusive. We show that actin waves, which stochastically migrate from the cell body towards neurite tips, direct microtubule-based transport during the multi-polar state. Our data argue for a mechanical control system whereby actin waves transiently widen the neurite shaft to allow increased microtubule polymerization to direct Kinesin-based transport and create bursts of neurite extension. Actin waves also require microtubule polymerization, arguing that positive feedback links these two components. We propose that actin waves create large stochastic fluctuations in microtubule-based transport and neurite outgrowth, promoting competition between neurites as they explore the environment until sufficient external cues can direct one to become the axon."

Furthermore, the actin waves promote the formation of more microtubule filaments."

This would allow each projection to explore its environment in the search for signals that promote axon growth. The next challenge is to understand how different signals select the \u201cwinning axon\u201d."

                        "text": "During development, hippocampal neurons transit through a multi-polar intermediate state in which neurons typically extend 4\u20135 immature neurites, which are each capable of becoming either an axon or a dendrite (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dotti et al., 1988</a>). These neurites stochastically retract and elongate for a period of hours to days before a single neurite is specified as the axon (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). This delayed axon specification is typically mediated by extracellular cues such as soluble growth factors, neighboring cells, and the extracellular matrix (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</a>) or in vitro by stochastic extension and stabilization of the longest single neurite (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dotti et al., 1988</a>). Previous studies showed that axon specification is based on a competition between \u201caxon-promoting\u201d signals such as Ras, Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), and Protein Kinase A (PKA) and \u201caxon-inhibiting\u201d signals such as Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2) and Protein Kinase G (PKG) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Shelly et al., 2010</a>). It is believed that these signals are controlled by the selective accumulation of axon-promoting proteins in the nascent axon via microtubule-based transport involving one or more self-reinforcing positive feedback loops (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fivaz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Inagaki et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Shi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Toriyama et al., 2006</a>). During the multi-polar state, however, pro-axon components appear to dynamically shuttle collectively to and from different neurites through an unknown mechanism (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), a process that has been investigated using a constitutively active version of the microtubule motor Kinesin-1 (a.a. 1\u2013560, CA-KIF5C) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hammond et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jacobson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Konishi and Setou, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Toriyama et al., 2010</a>). Kinesin-1 carries numerous proteins known to promote axon formation such as CRMP2 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kimura et al., 2005</a>) and WAVE/Sra (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kawano et al., 2005</a>), and perturbing Kinesin-1 expression or localization inhibits single axon formation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Konishi and Setou, 2009</a>). There is also evidence that the Kinesin-1 adaptor protein c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein-1 (JIP1) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dajas-Bailador et al., 2008</a>) and the PI3K interactor Shootin1 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Toriyama et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2010</a>) also relocalizes from one neurite to another before settling in the nascent axon. A similar dynamic collective relocalization of this kinesin motor domain has also been observed in vivo in developing neurons expressing CA-KIF5C (<a href=\"#bib30\">Randlett et al., 2011</a>). What drives these fluctuations is a fundamental open question, as the number, orientation, or age of microtubules may play a role, and conflicting studies suggest that Kinesin-1 may preferentially bind microtubules that are stable (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hammond et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Konishi and Setou, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Reed et al., 2006</a>) or newly polymerized (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nakata et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Valesoq et al., 1994</a>). These results regarding microtubule-based transport may also be related to an earlier observation that bulk cytoplasmic flow precedes axon specification (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bradke and Dotti, 1997</a>)."

Our study shows that actin waves act in concert with microtubules to direct microtubule-based transport and that these discrete transport events are tightly linked to neurite outgrowth during the multi-polar state before an axon is specified."

                        "text": "To investigate the role of actin waves in neuronal polarity, we first characterized actin waves in our in vitro\u00a0system. Consistent with previous studies of cultured hippocampal neurons extracted from embryonic rat brains (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ruthel and Banker, 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Flynn et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Katsuno et al., 2015</a>) actin waves are clearly visible in all neurons and neurites that bear actively growing processes (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), and travel nearly exclusively in an anterograde fashion, from cell body to growth cone (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>) during our DIV1 imaging window. Actin waves are generated at a median frequency of 1\u20132 actin waves per hour (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), move at average speeds of 2\u20133 \u00b5m/min (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and morphologically resemble growth cones (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b,c</a>). Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) revealed that actin waves are a mix of lamellipodial and filopodial structures that project outward from the neurite shaft, mainly contained to the x-y plane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). After an actin wave impacts the neurite tip, the neurite undergoes a growth spurt that often lasts until the growth cone shrinks (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d, e</a>). Afterwards, the neurite often does not grow outwards again until the arrival of an additional actin wave reactivates the growth cone. Kymographs of actin intensity paired with neurite length over time illustrate the tight correlation between neurite outgrowth and actin wave arrival (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). In fact, roughly 90% of neurite outgrowth in the DIV1 window is clearly concomitant with actin wave arrival (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Later stage imaging (DIV2+) displays greater neurite outgrowth in the absence of actin waves (data not shown). We further noted that actin waves entered different neurites at different times in an apparently stochastic fashion without an obvious pattern or frequency (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>). For the majority of live cell images in this study, fluorescently-tagged F-tractin (<a href=\"#bib20\">Johnson and Schell, 2009</a>) is used as a marker for f-actin, although actin waves can also be observed with only a membrane marker (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>) as well. Together with previous findings, our results strongly support the hypothesis that actin waves have a role in promoting the stochastic fluctuations in neurite length observed during the multi-polar phase of symmetry breaking."

Indeed, live cell imaging of F-tractin and EB1 revealed an increase in the number of EB1 puncta within and behind actin waves, with much lower levels of EB1 puncta in front of the wave (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9b</a>). This enrichment in the number of polymerizing microtubules progresses down the neurite with the actin wave, creating a dual wave of polymerizing microtubules and polymerizing actin. Control experiments using a maximum intensity projection of time lapse images showed that single EB1 puncta moved in a persistent fashion outward, confirming that they track with anterograde polarized polymerizing microtubules (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), consistent with previous measurements showing that microtubules generally polymerize outward during the multi-polar phase (<a href=\"#bib37\">Stepanova et al., 2003</a>)."

The mechanisms controlling the dynamic localization pattern of CA-KIF5C during symmetry breaking have previously been investigated, and the dynamic, stochastic nature of actin wave entry into various neurites struck us as reminiscent of the dynamic localization of CA-KIF5C. We first confirmed that the Kinesin-1 motor, CA-KIF5C, is often enriched at the tip of one or sometimes more neurites (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jacobson et al., 2006</a>) during the multipolar phase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). We also confirmed dynamic switching of the localization of CA-KIF5C back and forth between one or more neurites via the cell body over a period of many hours until most of the construct ultimately localizes to the emerging axon (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>)."

We marked the time when actin waves entered neurites by visual inspection and averaged the time course of change in total CA-KIF5C intensity in the neurite receiving the actin wave. This analysis showed in the same neurite a marked increase in CA-KIF5C over a period of over 10 min following an actin wave (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Moreover, we found that when CA-KIF5C entered a neurite previously lacking CA-KIF5C, such entry events occurred in parallel with an actin wave (in 34 out of 35 entry events). We then assessed the time lag (if any) between the increases of actin and CA-KIF5C signals during CA-KIF5C entry events and found that the increase in actin intensity preceded the increase in CA-KIF5C intensity by several minutes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). To address the concern that the co-localization of actin waves and CA-KIF5C entry into neurites may be an artifact of a cytoplasmic fraction of CA-KIF5C, we imaged CA-KIF5C moving in and out of neurites in neurons also expressing a cytoplasmic Turquoise fluorescent protein. Taking the ratio of CA-KIF5C over the Turquoise volume marker shows that the movement of CA-KIF5C into and out of neurites is significant over changes in volume; moreover, addition of the microtubule polymerization inhibitor Nocodazole eliminates the movement of CA-KIF5C into and out of neurites relative to a volume marker, confirming that CA-KIF5C movement is dependent on microtubules (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We first probed the potential role of actin waves in promoting microtubule polymerization and microtubule-based transport by examining both microtubule polymerization and microtubule-based transport after the addition of Jasplakinolide, an actin-stabilizing agent that stalls the progression of actin waves. We found that stalling actin waves halted the progression of CA-KIF5C (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a,b</a>) as well as the progression of the wave of polymerizing microtubules (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,d</a>), suggesting that progression of actin waves was necessary in order to continue the forward progression of the other two components. Notably, EB1 comets were still observed in the stalled actin wave, suggesting that although microtubules were still polymerizing in the actin waves, they were unable to polymerize beyond the structural bottleneck present at the front of the actin wave. This observation suggests that a mechanical mechanism may, at least partially, drive the increase in microtubule polymerization observed in the actin wave, and may explain the conundrum presented by the discrepant speeds of the components moving along with actin waves. More precisely, vesicular transport and Kinesin motors both advance at a speed of ~50 \u03bcm/min along microtubules while actin waves only advance at a speed of ~ 2 \u03bcm/min (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This raises important mechanistic questions of why Kinesin motors and vesicles have a net progression that is much slower than their molecular transport rate, why motors and vesicles appear to be restrained behind the leading edge of actin waves, and why vesicular transport stays elevated in and behind an actin wave (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>)."

                                "text": "To answer these discrepancies, we speculated that the bottleneck at the front of the actin wave restrains the movement of polymerizing microtubules and microtubule-based transport, and that the dilation of the neurite shaft caused by the actin wave may spatially de-restrict microtubules and allow more room for microtubules to polymerize towards the growth cone. In this hypothesis, the increase in the number of microtubules could enhance the flux of microtubule-based transport through the neurite. Another motivation for this hypothesis was that the speed of microtubule polymerization is ~10x faster than the speed of actin waves (in neurite: 20.4 +/- 5.4 um/min (39 measurements) in wave: 16.8 +/- 5.4 (23 measurements)), which is consistent with previously measured microtubule polymerization rates (<a href=\"#bib37\">Stepanova et al., 2003</a>). Thus, in order for the wave of EB1 puncta to advance at the same speed as the actin wave, individual EB1 puncta must stall and disappear at the leading edge of the actin wave, similar to what we see when a polymerizing microtubule hits the membrane of the neurite tip (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>, left). Indeed, kymograph analysis of EB1 comets moving through the bottleneck of the actin wave revealed that EB1 comets disappear at the bottleneck (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>, right). As a separate experiment, we quantifiedthe flow of EB1 puncta through two windows placed right before and right after the bottleneck (but within 6 \u03bcm of each other) at time points 100\u2009s apart which showed the same marked difference consistent with a loss of EB1 comets in between. In control experiments, we observed that the flow through each window does not significantly change over the time window measured, suggesting that microtubule polymerization is at a steady state over short time periods (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). Also, the difference between the flow of EB1 puncta through the two windows does not change over time (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, the larger flow of polymerizing microtubules through the window closer to the cell body does not reach the second window ahead of the actin wave, suggesting EB1 puncta disappear between the two windows. To understand this result, it is helpful to again consider that processive EB1 puncta should move 25\u201330 \u03bcm in approximately 100\u2009s, much faster than the actin waves. We also measured EB1 puncta flow versus neurite width in a smooth neurite or within an actin wave which reveals a correlation between neurite width and the number of EB1 puncta (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). The lack of a pronounced higher\u00a0number of EB1 puncta per unit area in actin waves relative to smooth neurites suggests that the mechanism by which actin waves promote microtubule polymerization is mainly steric, although this does not rule out other signaling cross-talks between the two cytoskeletal components. Furthermore, as for microtubule polymerization, the number of microtubules present also correlates with neurite width, as shown by SIM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>)."

Interestingly, we also used a Cdc42 Raichu FRET reporter and observed that only Cdc42 exhibited a relatively higher activity in front of the actin wave, suggesting that the consistent anterograde direction of actin waves propagation may in part be directed by Cdc42 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a,b</a>). To directly investigate the dependence of microtubule polymerization on actin waves, we used a photo-activatable Rac1 construct designed by the Hahn laboratory to test whether Rac activity is sufficient to generate actin waves (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wu et al., 2009</a>). This approach led to the successful generation of either fully processive (5 times) or partially processive (5 times) actin waves during successful Rac1 activations (18 times) using selective photo-excitation at the base of a neurite on a scanning confocal microscope (example in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>). The generated waves caused neurite widening (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and increased numbers EB1 puncta (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a>), consist with naturally-generated waves. This suggests that Rac1 activity is sufficient to initiate actin waves and to generate the enrichment of microtubule polymerization observed in actin wave."

We also found that the addition of a high dose of Taxol (50 nM), a small molecule that stabilizes microtubules, leads to non-processive bursts of actin polymerization, interfering with normal actin wave formation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>). 50 nM Taxol also appears to affect microtubule polymerization (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that microtubule stabilization and/or an effect on microtubule polymerization may be affecting actin wave production.

If such changes were long-lasting, we would expect that neurites would steadily thicken over time, which has not been previously observed. Also, our analysis of neurite growth over 10\u2009hr time periods suggest that the growth promoting effect of an incoming actin waves is lost after tens of minutes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). To determine whether the induced microtubule polymerization persists after an actin wave, we imaged the number of EB1 puncta in a neurite segment before, during, and after actin waves (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>, top). Markedly, the EB1 puncta number increased along with an actin wave and persisted after the wave passed (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>, bottom; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9b</a>), in agreement with our analysis of the persistence of the spatial profiles of Synaptophysin, volume, and microtubule enrichment. We then generated kymographs of actin intensity, EB1 intensity, and neurite width in a single section of neurite with multiple actin waves (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9c</a>). The kymographs reveal simultaneous increases in EB1 intensity and neurite width that remained past the passage of the actin wave, but gradually decayed with variable timescales (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9c</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). The transient nature of the increases in microtubule polymerization and microtubule-based transport was confirmed using a kymograph analysis of Synaptophysin vesicles in a neurite containing actin waves (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9d</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). Thus, our data as a whole suggests that each actin wave, by creating a transient increase in neurite width, creates a burst of microtubule polymerization and microtubule-based transport that will eventually decay after approximately 30 min and neurites will start to retract (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10a</a>). The transient characteristic of the increase in transport explains the frequent neurite retractions and the necessity of frequent actin waves to continually deliver cargo to a single growth cone to maintain and elongate the neurite and ultimately allow one of the neurites to dominate and become the axon."

                        "text": "Our study argues that developing neurons employ an interlinked cytoskeletal system whereby actin waves cross-talk with microtubules to direct microtubule-based transport and drive neurite extension. More broadly, our study suggests that the stochastic nature of actin waves leads to the stochastic increase of microtubule-based transport paired with growth cone extension in different neurites thereby creating the dynamic multi-polar state that allows a search for external cues and ultimately enables single axon formation. In particular, we show that the fluctuating actin waves control the previously observed pulsatile anterograde Kinesin transport generated during the multi-polar phase of symmetry breaking. We discovered that the link from actin wave to Kinesin-mediated transport appears to be based on a mechanical control mechanism whereby actin waves widen the neurite shaft and create the space needed for more microtubules to polymerize. The increase in microtubule polymerization in turn increases microtubule number and vesicular microtubule-based transport. In addition, these morphological changes and consequent changes in microtubule-based transport are transient, resulting in the pulsatile delivery of cargo to the growth cone and necessitating the generation of frequent actin waves in order to continue to deliver axon-promoting factors into the neurite. Finally, the results of our pharmacological perturbation of microtubules suggest that, in fact, actin waves and microtubules co-regulate each other through a positive feedback mechanism, potentially mediated by cross-talk mechanisms that have been identified in other systems (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akhshi et al., 2014</a>)."

Consistent with this finding, it has also been shown that depolymerizing actin in growth cones spatially de-restricts microtubule polymerization, thus promoting neurite growth (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bradke and Dotti, 1999</a>). A later study further found that ADF/cofilin, an actin severing enzyme, promotes neuritogenesis by disassembling the actin meshwork at the cortex, allowing for microtubule polymerization to promote a new protrusion (<a href=\"#bib14\">Flynn et al., 2012</a>). In conjunction with these previous studies, our results argue that the actin cortex structurally inhibits microtubule extension, and that a stent-like broadening of the neurite shaft or other mechanisms to \u201cloosen\u201d the actin cortex, by actin waves or other processes, relieves this inhibition to enable more microtubules to extend forward."

When receiving sufficient input, signaling in one of the neurites is expected to be strengthened and the neurite is marked as the future axon. Such a specification of one neurite as the axon is known to subsequently inhibit axonal maturation of the other neurites and convert them to dendrites (<a href=\"#bib11\">Esch et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">M\u00e9nager et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Shelly et al., 2010</a>). Together with these previous considerations, our study argues that actin waves have a dual function. First, they are the drivers for neurite outgrowth by directing microtubule-based transport to deliver axon-promoting factors to the growth cones at the neurite tip. Second, they promote competition between neurites by generating large stochastic fluctuations that allow each neurite to sample \u201cwinning\u201d and \u201closing\u201d states as they explore their surroundings for the cues that will ultimately determine axon specification."

However, imaging of later stage polarized neurons in culture showed that actin waves still move through the nascent dendrites and the axon, but their effect on neurite outgrowth appears to be smaller (<a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). This suggests that actin waves may become less important after polarization. With respect to their in vivo relevance, actin waves have been observed in hippocampal and cortical neurons in slice cultures (<a href=\"#bib13\">Flynn et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Katsuno et al., 2015</a>), although whether they promote microtubule polymerization and transport is more difficult to explore in this setting. Nevertheless, the results of our study suggest that actin waves could play an equally important role in neurite extension in vivo, to allow neurites to properly sense the polarized growth cues provided by the developing brain."

Our study further argues that the stochastic nature of actin waves creates the previously described stochastically fluctuating microtubule-based transport events during the multi-polar state. Thus actin waves may play a critical role in a stochastic search mechanism that allows a set of neurites to explore the surrounding space, integrate external signaling cues, and measure relative input differences to select the a \u201cwinning\u201d axon."

Original F-tractin, EB1 (human), Synatophysin (rat), and CA-KIF5C (a.a. 1\u2013560 of KIF5C (rat)) constructs were gifts from Michael Schell, Clare Waterman, Craig Garner, and Gary Banker respectively. mCerulean-PA-Rac1 was ordered from Addgene (Addgene #22030). Lyn-mCherry was used as a membrane marker, with the N-terminal Lyn sequence used described in (<a href=\"#bib18\">Inoue et al., 2005</a>). The original GFP-KIF5C(1\u2013560) vector was reassembled with Venus or Turquoise with the pCAGEN (Addgene #11160 [<a href=\"#bib26\">Matsuda and Cepko, 2004</a>]) backbone using PCR assembly methods while maintaining the original linker sequence. For the remaining constructs, all final constructs were generated by Gateway cloning using the same methodology. First, a destination vector with the desired CAG promoter (for higher, more even expression in primary cells [<a href=\"#bib29\">Qin et al., 2010</a>]) was generated. pCAGEN-DEST was constructed by taking the pCAGEN backbone and using the Gateway Vector Conversion System. Briefly, a Gateway cassette (Life Technologies) containing attR recombination sites with the ccdB gene and a chloramphenicol-resistance gene was inserted into the EcoRV restriction site contained within pCAGEN. Full-length YFP-EB1, F-tractin-mCherry (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wollman and Meyer, 2012</a>), pCerulean-PA-Rac1, and Citrine-Synaptophysin was PCRed with the TOPO-compatible tag CACC at the 5\u2019 end and put into a pENTR vector using the pENTR/D-TOPO vector kit (Life Technologies). The resulted entry clones were then subject to an LR reaction (LR Clonase II Enyzme Mix, Life Technologies) with pCAGEN-DEST."

Photo-excitation studies were performed on a Leica SP8 scanning confocal microscope with a white-light laser and a 40x (1.3 NA) objective. Photo-excitation was performed by locally exciting a region of the neuron with 480 nm light on the white-light laser (10 rounds of 5 excitations, 10 sec between rounds, 10% power on the FRAP user interface). Structured illumination microscopy was performed on a GE/Applied Precision OMX V4 (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) at the Neuroscience Microscopy Service at Stanford. All live cell imaging was performed at 37C in the absence of CO2 unless otherwise noted.

                                "text": "Image analysis was conducted using basic image analysis tools available in Fiji (<a href=\"#bib34\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a>) or custom-written MATLAB scripts. <i>Total neurite intensity</i>: analysis was performed by generating a binary mask of the summed timelapse set of images, and assessing total intensity within the mask for each timepoint. <i>2D line scans:</i> analysis was conducted as follows 1) generate binary mask of neurite section of interest, 2) skeletonize mask, 3) select two endpoints on skeleton to generate \u201cshortest path\u201d aka a single path, 4) divide path into regular coordinates with desired spacing, 5) divide original binary mask into windows based on proximity to the closest coordinate. Using the window analysis, parameters such as mean signal intensity (from live cell probes or fixed cell staining), max signal intensity, neurite width (total number of pixels divided in a window divided by given spacing), puncta per window, and others can be calculated. In most cases, intensity measurements were determined by taking the mean or median of the top 20% of pixels in a given window. <i>Trace alignment for averaging data between independent waves</i>: traces were aligned to the half-maximum value of the front of the actin wave (oriented towards the growth cone). Half maximum values were determined by manual identification of the maximum and minimum actin signals on the front half of the actin curve. Traces were then computationally aligned. <i>EB1 puncta counting:</i> to count EB1 puncta, puncta were manually identified and computationally assigned to their corresponding window. <i>EB1 flow measurements</i>: to calculate flow, the number of EB1 puncta passing through a perpendicular plane of the neurite was counted by eye for 20 s. <i>2D kymographs</i>: to generate 2D kymographs, window analysis was used with coordinate spacing of 1\u20133 pixel(s). For each window, the maximum signal from the various sensors was measured. For kymographs in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>, the \u201cMulti Kymograph\u201d feature of Fiji was used. <i>Mobile vesicle intensity measurement:</i> to obtain a measure of mobile vesicles, fast image series of 600\u00a0m<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s per image were gathered. Images were filtered using a tophat filter with a disc (2\u20133 pixel radius) to remove background signal. Negative values were then set to zero and the difference between subsequent images was taken in order to remove stationary particles. The resulting subtracted images from successive timepoints were added together and the summed image was subjected to the window analysis to produce line traces. <i>Single microtubule counting</i>: maximum intensity projection of SIM images were taken and the \u201cPlot Profile\u201d function used to take a line scan perpendicular to the neurite at desired locations in Fiji. Peaks in the line scan were identified by eye and counted as single microtubules. This method likely undercounts microtubules because of the high density of microtubules present in the neurite. <i>SIM images</i>: raw SIM data was processed on the API DeltaVision OMX softWoRx image processing software available in the Stanford Neuroscience Microscopy facility. Generation of maxiumum intensity projections and 3D reconstructions were performed in Fiji. <i>FRET analysis:</i> CFP and FRET images were collected with a 20x (NA = 0.75) Nikon objective. Regions of interest were identified and subjected to a flat background subtraction (background calculated after removal of the object of interest), segmentation, and smoothing with a Gaussian filter before calculating FRET/CFP ratios. Custom written Matlab scripts used for 2D line scan analysis, mobile vesicle intensity measurements, and FRET analysis can be found at github.com/MeyerLab/AWinans_Elife_2016."

The studies were done with cultured hippocampal neurons, before an axon is permanently specified and when all neurites have MTs arranged with plus ends out. The authors find that CA-KIF5C moves to and fro prior to a wave, but the arrival of a wave causes a widening of the shaft and predominantly anterograde movement of CA-KIF5C. The CA-KIF5C and actin wave move together along the shaft, followed by vesicles and a wider shaft with increased microtubules. The authors repeat Ruthel and Banker's finding that MTs are needed for the actin waves, and also show that stabilizing F actin with Jasplakinolide inhibits the MT increase that occurs in the wave region. The results suggest positive feedback between the actin wave and MT processes."

However, to my knowledge, waves have not been noted in the many publications in which neurons were labeled by in utero electroporation and then imaged in slice culture. As noted in Barnes and Polleux, 2009, in vivo pyramidal neurons inherit their axon-dendrite polarity from the trailing and leading processes during migration. The hippocampal culture system is essentially a \"repolarization\" of cells that were polarized in vivo before they were dissociated for culture. Studying symmetry breaking using the hippocampal culture system is well established, but the authors should be explicit about the artificiality of the system."

Does the increased MT extension (or initiation) in the wave result from the increased cross-section area or from increased rate of extension of individual MTs per unit volume? The super-resolution microscopy suggests that the microtubule number is greatly increased behind the wave. This means there are more MT ends available for extension. Perhaps EM would help show whether more MTs are being seeded in the wave, or whether the dilation is creating volume for more tubulin dimers to recruit to the growing plus ends."

Determining wave function within an initial study would be a lot to ask, but some further clarity on the limits of the study is needed. In particular, the physiological purpose of the waves is incompletely understood from the current data. Also, there is little evidence other than codistribution with CA-KIF5C and synaptophysin vesicles for a role in axon specification, as implied in the title and text. As a practical issue, it has remained unresolved how reliably the CA-KIF5C motor domain alone can locate the putative nascent axonal process. The current study seems to push the question back to the actin wave, but it remains unclear whether the CA-KIF5C construct is simply carried forward as part of the increased cytoplasmic volume, whether it is enriched solely as a result of the increased MT number, or whether it localizes specifically to MT plus ends, not a known form of behavior for this kinesin. Another issue is the limited data indicating that actin actually leads the way in this behavior. Modifications and additions to the text and data are recommended to clarify these and other important issues and to improve the presentation of the data."

Unfortunately, they had not, although in all cases the developmental window in which they imaged and the temporal resolution of imaging was not suited to observe actin waves, if they did exist. In in vitrocultures, actin waves are most frequent in young cultures (DIV1-2) in pre-polarized neurons. We also image a minimum of once every five minutes to capture the movement of the actin waves.

Also, there is little evidence other than codistribution with CA-KIF5C and synaptophysin vesicles for a role in axon specification, as implied in the title and text. As a practical issue, it has remained unresolved how reliably the CA-KIF5C motor domain alone can locate the putative nascent axonal process. The current study seems to push the question back to the actin wave, but it remains unclear whether the CA-KIF5C construct is simply carried forward as part of the increased cytoplasmic volume, whether it is enriched solely as a result of the increased MT number, or whether it localizes specifically to MT plus ends, not a known form of behavior for this kinesin.

We use a virtually identical construct to that used by Banker et al. (Neuron, 2006), with a change in the fluorescent protein that preserves the original linker. Cloning is described in the Materials and methods. CA-KIF5C localization is hugely dynamic. The fluorescently-tagged motor protein will move in and out of neurites at a timescale on the order of tens of minutes. It can also dwell in the growth cones for variable amounts of time. Localization of CA-KIF5C at any given time will be determined by the balance of the anterograde and retrograde movement of the protein. Given our finding that the CA-KIF5C travels with the actin wave and is thus linked with neurite outgrowth, it appears that CA-KIF5C presence in the neurite coincides with a neurite\u2019s attempt to grow out and become the axon. Its movement out of the neurite may occur when the signals traditionally responsible for axon specification are not strong enough to maintain CA-KIF5C and other possible pro-axon factors at the growth cone. During the multi-polar phase, each neurite has the inherent capability to become an axon, and thus most or all neurites will grow and receive growth promoting factors. Due to insufficient growth cues (both external and internal) however, most neurites will be unable to permanently specify as axons."

While their exciting work has the potential to become a fine eLife paper, the authors need to perform some experiments to put their idea on a more solid basis. All of the experiments are relatively straightforward and should be all done. 1) The authors show that kinesin-1 mediated transport is enhanced after waves. What happens when kinesin 1 activity is abrogated? Do the authors still see traffic into the axon? Do waves actually still form without kinesin 1 activity?</i>"

Knock-down of Kinesin-1 also causes an aberrant localization of CRMP2, a protein important for axonal development (Kimura et al., J. of Neurochemistry, 2005). These results suggest that Kinesin-1 does play a role in trafficking and polarity."

We first attempted to knock down all three known isoforms of Kinesin-1, but were unable to achieve more than mild knock down of each isoform (assessed via qPCR). We then decided to do a single knockdown of KIF5C, an isoform highly expressed in the brain, and examine the effect of the single knock down on actin waves formation. After achieving ~65% knock down (assessed via qPCR), we found no apparent affect on axon formation, assessed at DIV3. This differs from published results (Konishi and Setou, 2009), likely because the paper cited was able to knock down all three isoforms. We also observed no affect on actin wave formation during a co-culture experiment of control and KIF5C knock-down, assessed on DIV2. siRNA\u2019s were introduced before plating on DIV0. Moving forward, it is unclear whether the lack of phenotypes observed during knock-down is biologically significant, or a result of insufficient knock-down."

Could the actin waves enable this process by dynamizing the cortical actin. Consistent with this possibility the authors show that jasplakinolide prevents these processes. The authors should try the converse experiment with cytochalasin D or latrcunculin. If their hypothesis is true then cytoD treatment (probably local treatment) should enable dilation and enhance microtubule polymerization.

In response, we treated F-tractin-mCherry expressing neurons with increasing doses of Taxol (5 \u2013 50 nM) and observed effects on actin waves. Although we did not see any obvious effects on actin waves at low doses within the several hours of exposure observed, high doses of Taxol disrupted the processive nature of actin waves (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Bursts of actin polymerization were still observed, although the bursts could originate in different location in the neurite, rather than the cell body, and lacked the anterograde processive behavior of stereotypical actin waves. EB1 puncta measurements in the presence of a high dose of Taxol show that microtubule polymerization is diminished at high doses (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), so it remains unclear whether the effect of Taxol on actin waves is from the stabilization of microtubules, or from its affects on microtubules polymerization."

This enrichment ratio was also statistically greater than the control ratio in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>.
