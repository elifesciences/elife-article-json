Here we use anatomical, optogenetic, behavioral, and physiological techniques to identify a circuit in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> that can elicit stereotyped leg movements that groom the antennae. Mechanosensory chordotonal neurons detect displacements of the antennae and excite three different classes of functionally connected interneurons, which include two classes of brain interneurons and different parallel descending neurons. This multilayered circuit is organized such that neurons within each layer are sufficient to specifically elicit antennal grooming. However, we find differences in the durations of antennal grooming elicited by neurons in the different layers, suggesting that the circuit is organized to both command antennal grooming and control its duration. As similar features underlie stimulus-induced movements in other animals, we infer the possibility of a common circuit organization for movement control that can be dissected in <i>Drosophila</i>."

Such grooming movements are stereotyped yet have certain degrees of flexibility, which makes them ideal to study the neural circuits that underlie specific movements. Grooming further lends itself to this kind of investigation because it can be triggered by irritating the surface of the fly's body. There is also an extensive genetic toolkit that can be used to manipulate and observe the fruit fly's nervous system in detail."

Once these neurons were found, techniques\u2014including those that allow specific neurons in the fly's brain to be precisely controlled\u2014were then used to find other neurons that participate in the grooming process. This approach highlighted three groups of interneurons: two in the brain and one in the fly's equivalent of the spinal cord. Together these layers of sensory neurons and interneurons formed a circuit that triggered grooming whenever the antennae were disturbed."

This shows that the same neural circuit can both produce highly specific movements and modify the movements to provide flexibility. Neural circuits with similar features have been observed previously to induce other animal behaviors, for example, swimming in leeches. This suggests that this organization may be common in circuits that elicit movements. Additional experiments are now needed to validate whether similar circuits underlie other stereotyped movements in fruit flies and other animals."

This repertoire can include movements that serve particular purposes, such as feeding, grooming, song production, locomotion, and even coordinated facial poses for expressing different emotions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Grillner and Wall\u00e9n, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Grillner et al., 2005</a>). Many of these movements are produced by neural networks called pattern generators, which control the precise timing of motor neuron activity to coordinate stereotyped patterns of muscle contractions (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pearson, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kiehn and Kullander, 2004</a>). These neural networks are localized to distinct regions of the central nervous system (CNS), such as the hindbrain and spinal cord in vertebrates and ventral nerve cord in arthropods, and are capable of producing their respective movements even when experimentally isolated from the brain and sensory inputs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grillner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Marder et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">B\u00fcschges et al., 2011</a>). The activity of pattern generators can be initiated, or adapted to particular circumstances, in response to inputs from proprioceptive neurons, neuromodulators, or command-like neurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Marder et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Grillner, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ritzmann and B\u00fcschges, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Blitz and Nusbaum, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Harris-Warrick, 2011</a>)."

However, the organizational principles underlying how such command circuitry can both initiate movements and control their parameters remain unclear. Moreover, in many cases in which the activity of command-like neurons has been experimentally manipulated (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jing, 2009</a>), the behavioral impact of the manipulations was not assessed in intact and freely moving animals."

This progress has been enabled by the use of optogenetic and thermogenetic activation of specific, genetically targeted populations of neurons in freely moving adult flies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Flood et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Owald et al., 2015</a>). For example, activation of specific neuronal types can elicit stereotyped movements such as feeding, locomotion, courtship song, or escape (<a href=\"#bib47a\">Lima and Miesenb\u00f6ck, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Flood et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Inagaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bidaye et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib78a\">von Reyn et al., 2014</a>). Although some of these studies have led to the identification of individual neurons and groups of neurons that command their respective behaviors, the anatomical organization of and functional connections among such groups of neurons that control these movements has been largely unexplored."

                        "text": "Grooming movements (a.k.a. cleaning, scratching, or wiping reflexes) can be studied to determine the neuronal mechanisms by which specific movements are initiated and controlled. Grooming is ubiquitous among limbed animals as a means of protecting the body surface from different types of mechanical or chemical irritants (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sachs, 1988</a>). Such sensory stimuli induce the movement of a limb to the irritated body part, which then scratches or wipes the surface (<a href=\"#bib74\">Stein, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">D\u00fcrr and Matheson, 2003</a>). Because grooming movements can be predictably elicited by defined stimuli, they offer a way to access the sensory-connected neural circuitry that commands precisely targeted limb movements. In addition, grooming movements exhibit differing response durations, limb trajectories, stimulus-induced habituation, and can be suppressed, suggesting that the neural circuitry underlying these movements is subject to regulation and flexible control (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sherrington, 1906</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Stein, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Page and Matheson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Seeds et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, the study of grooming movements may reveal basic principles of movement control, but little is known about the neuronal mechanisms governing their initiation and modulation."

This raised the possibility that the functional organization of the neural circuitry controlling specific grooming movements could be defined. Here we examine a circuit that commands one of these grooming movements\u2014antennal grooming. This movement involves the grasping and brushing of the antennae with the legs in response to different types of irritants (<a href=\"#bib66\">Robinson, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">B\u00f6r\u00f6czky et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Seeds et al., 2014</a>). To deconstruct the neural circuitry underlying antennal grooming, we isolated a small number of GAL4-expressing transgenic lines that could elicit the appropriate leg movements when driving expression of the temperature-gated neuronal activator dTrpA1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hamada et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Seeds et al., 2014</a>). However, these lines expressed GAL4 in multiple neuronal subsets, making it difficult to determine which neurons were responsible for the grooming movement. In this work, we refine these GAL4 lines to identify the specific neurons that elicit antennal grooming. We show that these neurons are functionally connected to form a circuit that detects displacement of the antennae via mechanosensory neurons and then commands grooming through three different interneuronal classes. Our analysis of the complex organization of this circuit provides insight into how stereotyped movements are controlled."

To this end, we revisited the GAL4 lines we identified in our previous behavioral screen and examined them for expression in the antennae (<a href=\"#bib69\">Seeds et al., 2014</a>). One line expressed GAL4 in mechanosensory chordotonal neurons of the Johnston's Organ (JO, see below), and elicited antennal grooming when the targeted neurons were thermally activated by dTrpA1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Because this line also expressed in interneurons in the CNS (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>), we identified four additional GAL4 lines that target these sensory neurons by visually screening an image database of GAL4 line expression patterns (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jenett et al., 2012</a>). Each of these lines elicited antennal grooming when used to thermogenetically activate the targeted neurons, further implicating this population of JO neurons in the behavior (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013J</a>, behavior not shown)."

To examine whether the JO neurons elicit antennal grooming, we used the intersectional Split GAL4 (spGAL4) approach in an effort to restrict GAL4 activity to these neurons (<a href=\"#bib49\">Luan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</a>). Specifically, the activation domain (AD) of GAL4 is expressed in the genomic enhancer-driven pattern of one identified GAL4 line, while the DNA binding domain (DBD) of GAL4 is expressed in the pattern of another line (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). When both halves are co-expressed in the same cell, the activity of GAL4 is reconstituted. By co-expressing the AD and DBD in the patterns of different enhancer pairs, we observed reconstitution of GAL4 activity in the JO neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013E\u2032</a>). Five of these different AD/DBD pairs showed increased antennal grooming with thermogenetic activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, pairs referred to as aJO-spGAL4-1 through aJO-spGAL4-5, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> shows enhancer pairs used)."

The anatomy of these neurons identifies them as subsets of the approximately 500 chordotonal neurons within the JO, a mechanosensory structure that detects antennal movements. All five pairs were expressed in two distinct clusters of 40\u201350 neurons each in the dorsal and ventral regions of the JO, and we designate these clusters collectively as the antennal grooming JO (aJO) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2032\u2013E\u2032</a>). Although four of the pairs still targeted GAL4 activity to neurons outside of the JO (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013E</a>), aJO-spGAL4-1 expressed almost exclusively in the aJO, providing strong evidence that these sensory neurons elicit antennal grooming (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). To independently evaluate the necessity of the aJO in antennal grooming, we tested whether amputation of the antennae, and thus removal of the JO, would abolish the thermogenetically elicited behavior of the spGAL4 pairs. Indeed, antennal amputation abolished grooming at temperatures that would normally activate dTrpA1 and elicit antennal grooming (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These experiments demonstrate that the aJO induces antennal grooming."

However, unlike previously described C/E neurons that terminate in the AMMC, the aJO have three apparent projections within the ventral brain: the AMMC, the ventral subesophageal zone (SEZ), and the posterior SEZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). To test whether each neuron within the aJO has all three projections, we performed multicolor stochastic labeling (<a href=\"#bib55\">Nern et al., 2015</a>), which allows for visualization of individual neurons within the aJO population. Because each of the single neurons that we isolated projects from the AMMC to the ventral SEZ (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013F,I</a>), it would appear that the majority of neurons within the aJO have similar projections. A smaller subset appears to project from the AMMC to the posterior SEZ; however, we were unable to isolate individual cells to definitively show this (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4G,H</a>). In contrast to previously identified zone C/E-projecting neurons, we found no evidence of aJO neurons that project only to the AMMC. Because none of the previously described JO neurons project to the ventral SEZ (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Matsuo et al., 2014</a>), the aJO corresponds to a previously unrecognized set of neurons."

In contrast, activation of zone A or B neurons did not elicit antennal grooming (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3F,G,H</a>), indicating that only the zone C/E subpopulation elicits the behavior. Therefore, our data indicate that at least two types of zone C/E-projecting neurons are sufficient to induce grooming. The first terminates within the AMMC and constitutes a previously described set of JO neurons (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</a>), whereas the second type are the aJO neurons that project into the AMMC and then ventrally to the SEZ."

A visual screen of the GAL4 line expression pattern database (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jenett et al., 2012</a>) identified additional lines with interneuron projection patterns in the AMMC and SEZ that made them candidates for associating with the JO projections. Five of these lines elicited antennal grooming when thermogenetically activated (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). As each GAL4 line expressed in other neuronal populations (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013H</a>), we again generated spGAL4 lines using their respective enhancers to further restrict GAL4 activity to the behaviorally relevant interneurons. With this approach, we identified spGAL4 pairs that elicited antennal grooming with thermogenetic activation, and targeted interneurons that we designated aBN1, aBN2, and antennal descending neuron (aDN) for reasons described below (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Of note, there were striking differences in the amounts of grooming elicited by these pairs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

Each pair targets expression to either three or five of these neurons (aBN2-spGAL4-1, aBN2-spGAL4-2, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>)."

Given that the R18C11 enhancer was used to generate several of these pairs, and by itself targets expression to three aDNs when driving GAL4 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), we asked whether each spGAL4 pair targeted the same neuron or distinct neurons. By simultaneously combining the GAL4 DBD, expressed under control of the R18C11 enhancer, with two versions of the GAL4 AD, one expressed under control of the R76F12 enhancer and the other controlled by the R34C03 enhancer, we observed two aDNs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). This demonstrates that the spGAL4 pairs target distinct descending interneurons, and we named these aDN1 and aDN2. However, we did not identify a spGAL4 combination that exclusively expresses in the third R18C11-targeted aDN (named aDN3)."

                                "text": "We first asked whether the grooming elicited by aJO thermogenetic activation required the activity of the aBNs and aDNs by performing a behavioral epistasis test in which we genetically silenced the activity of the interneurons while activating the aJO (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). For silencing the interneurons, we used the aBN spGAL4 pairs and aDN-GAL4 to target expression of the synaptic transmission blocker, tetanus toxin (TNT) (<a href=\"#bib76\">Sweeney et al., 1995</a>). To genetically access the aJO independent of the interneurons, we employed the LexA binary transcriptional system so that the aJO enhancer R27H08 directed expression of LexA (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lai and Lee, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</a>). The resulting aJO-LexA line targeted aJO neurons and also elicited antennal grooming with thermogenetic activation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Although aJO-LexA targets more JO neurons than the aJO spGAL4 pairs (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>), expression of TNT in the aJO by aJO-spGAL4-1 significantly decreased antennal grooming in response to thermogenetic activation by aJO-LexA. This showed that the aJO-spGAL4-1 neurons constituted a major portion of the grooming elicited with aJO-LexA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, blue boxes). However, given that aJO-LexA targets additional zone C/E neurons that could induce grooming (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C\u2013E,H</a>), it is possible that they are responsible for the residual grooming that occurs with expression of TNT in aJO-spGAL4-1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, blue boxes). Therefore, we hereafter refer to the neurons targeted by aJO-LexA as aJO+C/E neurons. We next found that TNT expression in the interneurons aBN1 and aBN2 suppressed grooming when aJO+C/E neurons were thermogenetically activated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, red and yellow, respectively). However, grooming was not suppressed when TNT was expressed in the aDNs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, green boxes). We conclude that the aBNs are necessary for the grooming response to aJO+C/E activation, while additional descending neurons important for mediating antennal grooming may remain to be identified."

To test this, we glued iron powder to the third antennal segments and tethered the flies within an electromagnetic behavioral set up (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Application of a magnetic field at 1 Hz caused visible displacements of the antennae (31 \u00b1 6 \u03bcm) and elicited grooming of both the antennae and other head parts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, white boxes, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The aJO was critical for this response because expression of TNT in these neurons significantly reduced antennal and head grooming in response to the magnetic field (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, blue boxes, head grooming not shown). Given that activation of aJO elicits antennal grooming almost exclusively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), the role of the aJO in head grooming is unclear."

Intriguingly, expression of TNT targeted by the two different aBN2 spGAL4 pairs gave opposing results in this assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, yellow boxes): aBN2-spGAL4-1 activity showed necessity for antennal grooming while aBN2-spGAL4-2 did not. This contrasted with our earlier finding that both spGAL4 pairs disrupted grooming when the aJO+C/E neurons were thermogenetically activated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, yellow boxes). This may reflect a functional difference between the specific subsets of aBN2 neurons targeted by these two spGAL4 pairs in the context of antennal displacement. Similar to the results for thermogenetic activation of aJO+C/E neurons, expression of TNT (or the inward rectifying potassium channel Kir) in all three aDNs did not block the grooming response to antennal displacement (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, green box, Kir data not shown). Taken together, our results demonstrate that all identified neurons within the putative circuit elicit antennal grooming when activated, but not all are necessary for the grooming response to antennal displacement."

Activation of aBN1 induced a calcium response in aBN2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), whereas only high-intensity red light activation of aBN2 could cause a weak calcium response in aBN1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). The latter response was inconsistent, as only three out of five flies tested showed increases in calcium in aBN1 (average trace of three trials are shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, raw traces of all five trials shown in <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Further, because the aBN2-LexA driver used to express CsChrimson in aBN2 also expresses in neurons in other parts of the brain (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), we cannot rule out these other neurons as causing the aBN1 calcium response. Therefore, our results strongly support excitation from aBN1 to aBN2, but we only find weak functional imaging-based evidence supporting the reverse connection. Nevertheless, the excitatory responses that we observed are cholinergic because they were suppressed by the cholinergic receptor antagonist mecamylamine (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>)."

Interestingly, activation of aBN2 caused a mecamylamine-sensitive excitatory response in aDN1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>), yet decreased the basal fluorescence of GCaMP6s in aDN2 in a manner that was alleviated by mecamylamine (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). The latter observation leads us to propose that aBN2 excites an unidentified neuron that then inhibits aDN2. We tested this possibility by applying picrotoxin, a GABA and inhibitory glutamate receptor blocker (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cleland, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Liu and Wilson, 2013</a>). In the presence of picrotoxin, activation of aBN2 abolished the decreased calcium responses in aDN2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). This corroborated the presence of an inhibitory neuron (IN) that impinges on aDN2 that is stimulated by the activity of aBN2. Thus, the aDNs are subject to both feedforward excitation and indirect inhibition from aBN2. Taken together, these data demonstrate functional connectivity between the JO, aBNs, and aDNs and imply that they form a circuit that relays antennal sensory information through the brain and conveys it to the VNS."

The model includes putative <i>reciprocal excitation</i> between the aBNs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>) and <i>feedforward inhibition</i> of aDN2 mediated by aBN2 and an unknown IN (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). The proposed outputs of this circuit are the <i>parallel descending commands</i> to the VNS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), where the antennal grooming pattern-generating circuitry is expected to reside (see \u2018Discussion\u2019). We propose that the aDNs can act in parallel because experiments to thermogenetically activate aDN1 or aDN2 alone indicate that they are each sufficient to induce antennal grooming (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The presence of these features within the circuit suggests complex processing and raises the question of whether they influence the grooming output. Given that aBNs and aDNs induce different amounts of grooming with thermogenetic activation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), we postulated that one feature of the circuit is to control the duration of antennal grooming."

                                "text": "Our results raise the possibility that aBN1 and aBN2 are reciprocally excitatory, although the aBN2 to aBN1 excitatory connection was only weakly supported. One prediction of reciprocal excitation between the aBNs is that activation of either neuronal class will induce grooming that persists in the absence of stimulation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Major and Tank, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 2006</a>). To test this, we exploited CsChrimson's tight temporal control to activate these neurons briefly with red light, and then examined the dynamics of the grooming responses after red light cessation. Activation of either aBN1 or aBN2 elicited long antennal grooming durations that could persist for tens of seconds beyond red light cessation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). In contrast, activation of the aDNs, which are downstream of potential aBN-induced reciprocal excitation, should not induce persistent grooming (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Indeed, activation of aDN1 or aDN2 caused grooming that did not outlast the red light activation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). We observed similar results using additional spGAL4 pairs that target aBN1, aBN2, and aDN2 (not shown). Of note, activation of aDN2-elicited antennal grooming that lasted until the stimulus ended (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>), whereas activation of aDN1 elicited about 50% fewer grooming bouts that terminated prior to the red light turning off (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). This raises the intriguing possibility that the parallel aDNs induce different durations of antennal grooming. We next found that red light activation of the aJO, which is upstream of the aBNs, could also elicit grooming that persisted after red light cessation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). This suggests that the aJO might excite the aBNs, which then induce persistent grooming. Taken together, our data indicate that the circuit produces persistent antennal grooming through aBN1 and aBN2. Future experiments will test whether the persistence is caused by reciprocal excitation or alternate mechanisms (see \u2018Discussion\u2019). We concluded that our data describe an antennal grooming circuit whose components have the potential to modulate the duration of grooming, possibly mediated by their connectivity."

This was based both on our discovery that the JO induces grooming, and that different JO neurons can detect antennal movements to elicit specific behavioral responses (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yorozu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Matsuo et al., 2014</a>). Further, insects can encounter conditions in their natural environments, such as static electricity or unexpected mechanical disruptions that can move the antennae and cause different aversive behavioral responses (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hunt et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Newland et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jackson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Matsuo et al., 2014</a>). We have observed that flies show increased grooming of their antennae in chambers with high levels of static, and that this grooming was ablated using antistatic agents (unpublished observations). This led us to find that imposed deflections of the antennae induce grooming through the JO. Because such deflections likely disrupt normal antennal functions, such as hearing (<a href=\"#bib21\">G\u00f6pfert and Robert, 2002</a>), grooming may provide a means of restoring them to their proper position and function."

We have shown that dust on the antennae induces grooming in flies (<a href=\"#bib69\">Seeds et al., 2014</a>), however, it seems unlikely that small particles of dust could cause the large displacements that induce grooming in this work. This is supported by our observations that expression of TNT in the aJO does not cause defects in antennal dust removal (unpublished data), but does disrupt the grooming response to antennal displacements (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Therefore, dust might be detected by different sensory neurons, such as the mechanosensory bristle neurons found on the surface of the antennae. Bristle neurons are good candidates for stimulating grooming, given that mechanical stimulation of bristles on other body parts can induce site directed grooming responses (<a href=\"#bib77\">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</a>). Like JO neurons, the antennal bristle mechanosensory neurons send projections to the AMMC, and possibly to the SEZ (<a href=\"#bib32\">Homberg et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Melzig et al., 1996</a>), where they could induce grooming by interacting with the interneurons described in this work. This raises the possibility that multiple different sensory neuron types feed into the circuit to induce grooming. However, we have not yet identified spGAL4 lines that specifically target the antennal bristle mechanosensory neurons to allow us to test this hypothesis."

Our data suggest multiple possible routes of feedforward excitation through the circuit layers to induce antennal grooming. For example, the function of at least a subset of the aBN2 neurons was not necessary for grooming in response to physical displacement of the antennae, whereas they were necessary in response to thermogenetic activation of the JO. Thus, feedforward excitation likely has multiple routes through the antennal grooming circuit, but why would this be? One possibility is that each route reflects specific features of the sensory stimulus. Different stimuli might be sensed by distinct JO neurons or mechanosensory bristle neurons on the antennae that engage different ensembles of neurons within the circuit to produce specific grooming responses. Therefore, it may be revealing to test whether different stimuli coopt specific circuit components to fine\u2013tune parameters of grooming, such as short vs persistent grooming durations."

Our results do not reveal a natural stimulus that induces persistence, as displacements of the antennae rarely induced persistent grooming (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Persistence was previously described in the grooming responses of other animals, where it was found to be at least partially dependent on the nature of the stimulus (e.g., stimulus strength, duration, or frequency) (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sherrington, 1906</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Stein, 2005</a>). Thus, future work will explore the possibility that specific stimulus parameters can evoke persistent antennal grooming in flies. Additionally, persistence indicates the presence of a mechanism that produces long lasting neural activity within the grooming sensorimotor response. Such persistent activity could provide a mechanism by which temporal summation of successive stimuli is achieved. That is, successive, sub-threshold stimuli have been shown to be \u2018remembered\u2019 or summed to elicit grooming, although the neuronal mechanisms have not been identified (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sherrington, 1906</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Stein, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Guzulaitis et al., 2013</a>).

These behaviors are mediated by JO neurons that are localized to distinct regions of the mechanosensory structure and respond to high frequency vibrations (e.g., sounds) or more tonic movements (e.g., wind) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yorozu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Matsuo et al., 2014</a>).

These neuronal types have been termed trigger and gating neurons respectively (<a href=\"#bib73\">Stein, 1978</a>). In the marine mollusc (<i>Tritonia diomedia</i>) and in the leech (<i>Hirudo medicinalis</i>), trigger neurons immediately downstream of sensory neurons induce persistent swimming motor patterns (named Tr1 in both animals) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Frost et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kristan et al., 2005</a>). Gating neurons then induce swimming downstream of Tr1 in both animals (named DRI in the mollusc and 204/205 in the leech). This organization is strikingly similar to the layers of neurons that induce antennal grooming identified here; the aBNs induce persistent grooming and might be considered trigger neurons, whereas aDN2 could serve as a gating neuron.

We discussed above the possibility that the circuit may have different possible routes of feedforward excitation. Such organization may provide different points at which the circuit can be modulated, thus allowing for flexible control of different movement parameters. In the antennal grooming circuit, flexible control of movement duration could be provided by the parallel aDNs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), which appear to elicit different amounts of antennal grooming when activated. Artificially activated aDN1 elicits isolated grooming bouts that terminate despite continued activation, whereas activated aDN2 elicits grooming throughout the activation period. These observations are reminiscent of two descending neurons in molluscs that initiate biting movements during feeding, as one induces longer protraction durations whereas the other induces shorter durations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jing and Weiss, 2005</a>). This ability to generate distinct movement parameters, such as duration, may be a general feature of descending neurons that induce the same movement. Other parameters that might be differentially controlled are illustrated by locomotor systems, wherein descending neurons can elicit movement while controlling parameters such as speed and direction (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dubuc et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Roberts et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Mullins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Puhl et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">El Manira and Grillner, 2014</a>)."

Such an effect has been described for the two descending neurons controlling mollusc bite protraction, as activating the two together produces intermediate durations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jing and Weiss, 2005</a>).

Alternatively, aBN1 and aBN2 could have intrinsic membrane properties that allow them to produce prolonged responses to brief excitation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Major and Tank, 2004</a>). Thus, future experiments will examine whether reciprocal excitation or intrinsic membrane properties of the aBNs produce persistent grooming."

The level of behavioral analysis presented in this work reveals that the induced trajectories of the legs are specific for the antennae rather than other head parts; however, it does not allow for the detection of finer antennal grooming movements. Grooming is characterized by an initial targeting of the legs to the stimulated body part, followed by cyclic movements that groom the region (<a href=\"#bib11\">D\u00fcrr and Matheson, 2003</a>). Higher resolution analysis of the leg kinematics could help resolve the boundary limits on the head to which the antennal grooming movements are confined during these two phases, and allow for determining how stereotyped these movements are. Furthermore, such analysis could elucidate how the legs interact with the antennal region to perform the grooming movements. Thus, higher resolution analysis would facilitate testing possible roles for the circuit in controlling different variables of antennal grooming, such as the limb trajectories or speed."

                                "text": "Recent work indicates that command-like neurons may constitute a common means of eliciting specific movements in insects. Tools that allow for both acute control of neuronal activity and precise genetic targeting of specific neurons in fruit flies have enabled experiments that merge behavioral analyses with real time neuronal manipulations. Such experiments demonstrate that activation of specific neurons can elicit distinct movements, such as escape, locomotion, or courtship song (<a href=\"#bib47a\">Lima and Miesenb\u00f6ck, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Flood et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Inagaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bidaye et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib78a\">von Reyn et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, work in crickets, grasshoppers, and locusts has revealed specific neurons that elicit courtship stridulation or flight (<a href=\"#bib60\">Pearson et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hedwig, 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2000</a>). Given our discovery of a circuit that specifically elicits antennal grooming, it would appear that the use of dedicated neurons to command specific movements is a common mechanism of behavioral control in insects. However, these command-like neurons may be embedded in larger, more dynamic neural networks in which neurons that elicit one movement also participate in other movements (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kupfermann and Weiss, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kristan, 2008</a>). For example, in the leech several of the neurons involved in commanding swimming were found to also be excited during stimulus-induced shortening movements (<a href=\"#bib71\">Shaw and Kristan, 1997</a>). Such findings indicate that neurons that can command one movement might also participate in the production of other movements, with their specific output subject to the collective activities of multiple different neurons within a given network (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kristan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kristan, 2008</a>). Thus, future experiments that examine whether the antennal grooming command circuit participates in controlling additional movements, may further elucidate the properties of neural networks that enable the performance of specific movements."

The brain and VNS were placed on a poly-lysine-coated coverslip. Dissections were visualized using minimal illumination to avoid activation of CsChrimson. The preparation was continuously perfused in saline at 60 ml/hr. Imaging was done using a two-photon scanning microscope (Bruker, Billerica, MA) with an excitation wavelength of 920 nm. Imaging fields of view were chosen as to contain a distinctive process of the candidate post-synaptic neuron, which included processes at the midline for the aDNs and aBN2, and vertical running processes close to the midline for aBN1."

Instantaneous powers measured out of the objective ranged between 50 \u03bcW/mm<sup>2</sup> and 800 \u03bcW/mm<sup>2</sup>. Trains were delivered at 50 Hz. Experiments usually started with a 50-pulse train. If no response was observed, the power was raised progressively until one occurred or the maximum power was reached. Each experimental run consisted of 4 repeats lasting for approximately 20 s. Runs were repeated approximately every 2 min. When postsynaptic responses were observed, we did not see any desensitization. See <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> for stimulus conditions used for data shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. For blocking nicotinic or GABAergic/glutamatergic transmission, mecamylamine (50 \u03bcM) or picrotoxin (30 \u03bcM) were administered through a perfusion line for 3\u201310 min, followed by a drug-free wash (drugs from Sigma). Pharmacology experiments were run using samples that showed consistent responses. Stimulus conditions were chosen that elicited reliable transient responses. Average traces shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013I</a> are from those trials where pharmacology experiments were done (trials used to generate average traces shown in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 2, 3</a>). Average traces shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a> correspond to all flies and trials at the indicated stimulus conditions shown in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 2, 3</a>."

Of note, the selection method relies only on average intensity and not activity, because we wanted to use the same detection method for responsive and non-responsive runs. This also relies on selecting fields of view that unambiguously contain only the neuron of interest. Analysis was run in Julia (<a href=\"http://julialang.org/\">http://julialang.org/</a>)."

Moreover, they have a nicely supported model for functional interactions in the circuit, including the role of inhibition \u2013 this is terrific!\u201d. Another reviewer commented: \u201cThis study will be highly interesting for neuroscientists in the field of motor control as well as for scientists studying animal behavior in general\u201d. A third reviewer also stated: \u201cThe authors identify novel chordotonal sensory neurons innervating Johnston's Organ (JO) in the second antennal segment, and 3 classes of interneurons involved in this behavior, including 2 classes of local neurons (LNs) and several classes of descending neurons (DNs). This clearly required a heroic effort, and the authors are to be congratulated for their work\u201d."

This observation offers a fascinating insight into the fundamental question of how the fly's brain directs its appendages to groom the precise part of the body surface from which it is receiving a sensory irritant or input: evidently the sensory neurons that innervate that part of the body surface activate a motor circuit that controls limb movement with precisely the right trajectory to direct them to the location from which the sensory input was received. The data presented here show that deeper layers of the circuit exhibit a similar level of functional specificity. It is almost as if this part of the fly's sensory-motor system is built like a marionette: a dedicated, position-specific sensory-interneuron-motor loop for each body part that needs to be groomed. While there were hints of this in the original paper, the present study demonstrates this much more clearly and the degree of specificity uncovered, at all layers of the circuit, is remarkable. Although the results of this paper do not yet explain how this sensory information is converted to such a specific limb trajectory through 3-D space at the motor level, they provide an important step in this direction. It is, therefore, surprising that the authors do not raise this interesting point at all in their Introduction and Discussion. They are encouraged to do so."

They are encouraged to downplay the reciprocal excitation/persistent activity part of their story, which is the weakest, and emphasize the aspects of their findings that are most relevant to the grooming system, namely the remarkable functional specificity they have uncovered. The circuit architecture they have defined certainly hints at a more complex function and regulation than would be expected from a simple feed-forward stimulus-response reflex pathway, and this is interesting as well. Above all, they should make clear to the reader (especially the non-specialist) the limitations of the methods they have employed, and the parts of the story that are rock-solid vs. those that are less so."

The authors place a great deal of emphasis on the finding of an apparent reciprocal excitation loop between the aLN1 and aLN2 local interneurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), and invoke it to explain their interesting observation that activation of these interneurons can produce persistent grooming (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Unfortunately, due to limitations in the specificity of the reagents used to perform these experiments, the evidence of reciprocal excitation is unconvincing and it is very difficult to correlate the physiological (imaging) and behavioral data. Firstly, the evidence of reciprocal connectivity is weak. The degree of anatomical overlap between aLN1 and aLN2 neurons is very limited (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> \u2013 by the way, please indicate with dashed outlines the location of the AMMC, posterior and ventral SEZ on these figures for the readers' benefit). Although the evidence for functional connectivity from LN1\u2192LN2 neurons is convincing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), the evidence for the reciprocal connection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) is not. Apparently (based on the information provided in <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 3</a>), to test for the latter connection the authors used an LN2-LexA driver to express CsChrimson in these neurons (in contrast to the reverse experiment where they used an LN1-GAL4 driver to express the opsin). This LN2-LexA driver is extremely broadly expressed, in the central brain and optic lobes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1C</a>). Without specific 2-photon targeted activation of the LN2 neurons themselves, it is difficult to be confident that the excitatory drive on the LN1 neurons in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> is indeed due to input from the aLN2 cells."

Close inspection of the supplemental data indicates that even this weak average recording is misleading, because only a fraction of the flies tested, and only a small fraction of trials, yielded any response at all (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 3</a>, LN2 to LN1). This is very different from a result in which the neurons showed a weak response in most of the flies in most of the trials. This is all the more puzzling given that there are more aLN2 than aLN1 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), and that the activation of neurons in the aLN2-spGAL4-2 line has the strongest effect to promote grooming of any of the lines characterized in the paper (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and 7C</a>). Thus, the evidence for an LN2\u2192LN1 connection that is relevant to grooming is, in my opinion, weak and unconvincing. At the very least, the circuit diagram in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> should be re-drawn to show that the connection from aLN2\u2192aLN1 is far weaker and more questionable than the reverse connection (perhaps using a dashed line and question mark), and this issue and associated caveats should be clearly spelled out in the Discussion."

We mention that this response was inconsistent, as only three out of five flies tested showed increases in calcium in aBN1.

This text reads: \u201cAlthough our work only provides weak evidence for reciprocal excitation between the aBNs, a mechanism whereby reciprocal connections maintain their excitation offers a plausible explanation for the persistence that we observe. Alternatively, aBN1 and aBN2 could have intrinsic membrane properties that allow them to produce prolonged responses to brief excitation. Thus, future experiments will examine whether reciprocal excitation or intrinsic membrane properties of the aBNs produce persistent grooming (<a href=\"#bib50\">Major and Tank, 2004</a>).\u201d"

However, persistence was previously described in the grooming responses of other animals, where it was shown to be at least partially dependent on the nature of the stimulus (e.g. stimulus strength, duration, or frequency). Thus, future work will explore the possibility that specific stimulus parameters can evoke persistent antennal grooming in flies."
