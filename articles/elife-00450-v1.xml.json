In the early twentieth century, the physiologist T Graham Brown identified complex networks of neurons in the spinal cords of cats that coordinated walking and other rhythmic movements (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brown, 1911</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">1914</a>). However, it was only when these networks\u2014which are also called central pattern generators\u2014were rediscovered in the early 1960s that their importance was fully appreciated (<a href=\"#bib14\">Wilson, 1961</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ikeda and Wiersma, 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Mulloney and Smarandache, 2010</a>). From this point onwards, research into the generation of rhythmic activity by these networks and the influence of sensory feedback on this activity, has continued at a rapid pace (<a href=\"#bib11\">Marder et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Marder and Bucher, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Lamb and Calabrese, 2011</a>)."

However, this situation is starting to change, and several groups have explored locomotion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Berni et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Heckscher et al., 2012</a>) and its development (<a href=\"#bib5\">Crisp et al., 2012</a>) in fruit fly maggots."

Until now, this had required time-consuming manual frame-by-frame video analysis, which is a difficult process to automate (<a href=\"#bib15\">Wosnitza et al., 2012</a>). Exploiting an optical phenomenon known as frustrated total internal reflection (fTIR), Mendes and co-workers have developed an imaging method and associated analysis software that can rapidly analyze the footprints (tarsal contacts) and body position of a fly as it walks (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). As well as revealing the insect's speed and the distance covered, the software extracts key parameters such as the degree to which limb movements are coordinated, thus allowing the insect's gait to be classified. Similar technology is already available for tracking the movements of larger animals such as rats (<a href=\"http://www.noldus.com/animal-behavior-research/products/catwalk\">http://www.noldus.com/animal-behavior-research/products/catwalk</a>), but the Columbia team is the first to scale it down to fly-like dimensions."

These differences led Mendes et al. to suggest that flies use distinct neural programs for walking at different speeds."

To examine this interaction, the Columbia team used genetically modified flies that either lack all leg proprioceptors\u2014sensors that detect the length and tension of muscles and the angle of joints, which together provide information about a limb's position in space\u2014or a specific class of stretch receptors known as chordotonal organs. Both types of mutant fly walked more slowly than wild-type flies, and showed a more uneven gait with footprints that were less precisely aligned. Nevertheless, the mutant flies maintained a typical tripod gait and near normal coordination of limb movements with respect to body segment and side. It seems therefore that proprioception is not essential for coordinated walking, but walking is less precise without it."

Indeed, in some respects, the behaviour of feedback-deprived flies resembled that of wild-type flies walking at high speed. These observations suggest that flies walking at slow\u2013medium speeds use distinct neural programs from those walking at faster speeds, and that flies walking at fast speeds are less dependent on sensory feedback."

In the slow-moving stick insect (<i>Carausius</i>), sensory feedback from legs in the stance phase appears to be required for inter-leg coordination (<a href=\"#bib4\">B\u00fcschges 2012</a>), whereas this does not seem to be the case in the fruit-fly experiments at Columbia. To account for this apparent discrepancy, Mendes et al. speculate that when all six legs are equally impaired, flies resort to using the central pattern generator alone, which is sufficient to execute the tripod gait. Other recent studies on adult flies, in which single legs were amputated, are consistent with this speculation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Wosnitza et al., 2012</a>)."
