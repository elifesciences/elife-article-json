Transporter specificity towards the recently evolved glucosinolates characteristic of <i>Brassicales</i> is shown to evolve prior to emergence of glucosinolate biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that glucosinolate transporters belonging to the ubiquitous NRT1/PTR FAMILY (NPF) likely evolved from transporters of the ancestral cyanogenic glucosides found across more than 2500 species outside of the <i>Brassicales</i>. Biochemical characterization of orthologs along the phylogenetic lineage from cassava to <i>A. thaliana,</i> suggests that alterations in the electrogenicity of the transporters accompanied changes in substrate specificity. Linking the evolutionary path of transporter substrate specificities to that of the biosynthetic pathways, exemplify how transporter substrate specificities originate and evolve as new biosynthesis pathways emerge."

Transporter specificity towards the recently evolved glucosinolates characteristic of <i>Brassicales</i> is shown to evolve prior to emergence of glucosinolate biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that glucosinolate transporters belonging to the ubiquitous NRT1/PTR FAMILY (NPF) likely evolved from transporters of the ancestral cyanogenic glucosides found across more than 2500 species outside of the <i>Brassicales</i>. Biochemical characterization of orthologs along the phylogenetic lineage from cassava to <i>A. thaliana,</i> suggests that alterations in the electrogenicity of the transporters accompanied changes in substrate specificity. Linking the evolutionary path of transporter substrate specificities to that of the biosynthetic pathways, exemplify how transporter substrate specificities originate and evolve as new biosynthesis pathways emerge."

A group of transporters known as the NPF family move some of these compounds across the cells outer membrane. The types of substrates they transport vary in different plants. In cassava, for example, NPF transporters move compounds called cyanogenic glucosides, which are poisonous to humans and other animals. On the other hand, NPF transporters in another plant called <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> can move bitter-tasting compounds called glucosinolates. The process that makes glucosinolates in plants evolved from the process that makes cyanogenic glucosides."

To answer this question, J\u00f8rgensen et al. studied the NPF family in <i>A. thaliana</i>, cassava and another plant called papaya that makes both cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates. The experiments suggest that NPF transporters able to move both cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates evolved before plants evolved the ability to make glucosinolates. Later in evolution, these multi-specific transporters specialized to only move glucosinolates. J\u00f8rgensen et al. also show that early glucosinolate transporters could move a broad variety of glucosinolates but later evolved to only transport particular types."

New biosynthesis pathways continuously emerged throughout evolution, resulting in a vast diversity in metabolite chemical structures (&gt;200.000 structures tentatively identified in the plant kingdom alone), where some are restricted to certain taxa and others are found broadly (<a href=\"#bib83\">Weng et al., 2012</a>). Matching the vast structural diversity of metabolites, approximately 10% of coding sequences of contemporary genomes encode transport proteins with diverse substrate specificities (<a href=\"#bib72\">Saier and Ren, 2006</a>) that enable transport of metabolites and ions into and out of cells. However, the evolutionary path that leads to the rise of new transporter substrate specificity upon emergence of new metabolites is unknown. Classical evolution theory (<a href=\"#bib65\">Ohno, 2013</a>) and several studies (e.g. <a href=\"#bib29\">Fani and Fondi, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Prasad et al., 2012</a>) support the hypothesis that new enzyme functions arise in duplicated genes if they are subject to unique selection pressure, - alternatively they rapidly become pseudogenes. A key example is found in the evolution of mineral corticoid and glucocorticoid receptors found in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bridgham et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Carroll et al., 2008</a>). These two receptors evolved post duplication of a dual specificity aldosterone and cortisol receptor basal to the jawed vertebrate lineage (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bridgham et al., 2006</a>). However, aldosterone biosynthesis did not arise before the advent of tetrapods suggesting that the ancestral receptor evolved affinity towards aldosterone before the hormone was present, possibly as a by-product of the receptors\u2019 affinity towards chemically similar ligands (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bridgham et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Carroll et al., 2008</a>). Thus, it appears that selection pressure enforced upon related but distinct ligands can drive the emergence of receptors\u2019 affinity towards a new substrate. In comparison, it is not clear if new transporters evolve de novo with emergence of new substrates, or whether gene duplications allow ancestral multifunctional proteins to take on greater specificity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010</a>)."

Through an arms race between plants and interacting organisms (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bidart-Bouzat and Kliebenstein, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Z\u00fcst et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kliebenstein et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">de Vos et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Sanchez-Vallet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Prasad et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Newton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Fahey et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agerbirk and Olsen, 2012</a>), the glucosinolate pathway evolved to produce\u00a0&gt;130 glucosinolate structures with diverse amino acid-derived side chains (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fahey et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agerbirk and Olsen, 2012</a>). Also, two H<sup>+</sup>/glucosinolate symporters, GTR1 and GTR2, belonging to the NPF family (<a href=\"#bib46\">L\u00e9ran et al., 2014</a>) and with broad glucosinolate specificity (i.e. no discrimination against amino acid side chain) were identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nour-Eldin et al., 2012</a>) that predominantly produces aliphatic and indole glucosinolates (<a href=\"#bib57\">Mithen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Brown et al., 2003</a>). Although transporters for cyanogenic glucosides are yet to be identified (<a href=\"#bib39\">J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2005</a>), we set out to investigate whether the evolution of a new biosynthetic pathway (here glucosinolates from cyanogenic glucosides) promoted the co-evolution of transporter specificity, i.e. did glucosinolate transporters originate from cyanogenic glucoside transporters in the NPF family? Furthermore, <i>in planta</i> studies suggest the existence of an additional glucosinolate transporter with narrow specificity for the recently evolved indole glucosinolates (<a href=\"#bib4\">Andersen et al., 2013</a>) that are essential for innate immune responses (<a href=\"#bib73\">Sanchez-Vallet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Clay et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bednarek et al., 2009</a>). We therefore investigated if evolution within a biosynthetic pathway (here emergence of indole glucosinolates) is accompanied by evolution in transporter substrate specificity."

By characterizing substrate specificity and electrogenicity in orthologs along the phylogenetic lineage from cassava to <i>A. thaliana</i>, we provide a model for the evolutionary path of the substrate specificity of a plant specialized metabolite transporter. Surprisingly, we show that glucosinolate transport capacity likely occurred prior to the emergence of glucosinolate biosynthesis in dual-specificity transporters of cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates. With the emergence of glucosinolate biosynthesis, the transporters lost the capacity to transport cyanogenic glucosides. Moreover, we show that the first glucosinolate transporters had broad specificity and later subfunctionalized towards specific classes of glucosinolates. Our data suggests that changes in electrogenicity have accompanied the evolutionary changes in substrate specificity. Our results exemplify how new transporter substrate specificities evolve when new metabolites arise."

                                "text": "To assess the evolutionary path of GTR transporters, we first set out to identify the putative indole-specific glucosinolate transporter. In a previous study (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nour-Eldin et al., 2012</a>), we found that the glucosinolate transport capability of the NPF family is confined to the NPF2.8\u20132.14 transporters that cluster closely with AtGTR1 (NPF2.10) and AtGTR2 (NPF2.11). We thus hypothesized that the indole-specific glucosinolate transporter could be found in this NPF subclade in <i>A. thaliana</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Via heterologous expression in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, we screened six of the seven members within this subclade for transport of indol-3-yl-methyl glucosinolate (I3M, the simplest indole glucosinolate) and 4-methylthiobutyl glucosinolate (4MTB) \u2013 representing a highly abundant aliphatic glucosinolate in <i>A. thaliana</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>). NPF2.9 (At1g18880, hereafter GTR3) - the closest homolog of GTR1 and GTR2 - transported I3M effectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Two Electrode Voltage Clamp (TEVC) electrophysiology and time-course uptake assays showed that I3M, but not 4MTB, induces negative currents in GTR3-expressing oocytes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>) and that GTR3 can over-accumulate I3M, but not 4MTB, against a concentration gradient (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). Alternatively, an un-coupled conductance may accompany 4MTB transport in GTR3 resulting in non-electrogenic transport or transport rates may be below the electrophysiological detection level. In comparison, GTR1 over-accumulated both 4MTB and I3M (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>) and elicited negative currents of similar amplitude for both glucosinolates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>)."

Through competition assays we show that GTR3-mediated 4MTB uptake is strongly inhibited by 10% I3M, whereas 10-fold excess 4MTB does not affect I3M uptake (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). In contrast, GTR1 transports 4MTB and I3M to the same ratio as applied in the assay media (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). In accordance with previous characterization (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wang and Tsay, 2011</a>), GTR3 imports nitrate into oocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Nitrate at concentrations 100-fold in excess of I3M or 4MTB did not outcompete uptake of neither glucosinolate, indicating that the two substrates are not mutually exclusive (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013G</a>). In conclusion, our biochemical characterization shows that GTR3 is an electrogenic transporter with a high apparent affinity and strong preference for indole glucosinolates."

GTR3 is strongly expressed in the plasma membrane of root phloem companion cells (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wang and Tsay, 2011</a>) and is co-expressed with GTR1 and GTR2 at the tissue level in other tissues according to publicly available translatome data (<a href=\"#bib58\">Mustroph et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <i>A. thaliana gtr3</i> mutants accumulate significantly lower concentrations of indole glucosinolates in roots compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This shift was increased in <i>gtr1 gtr2 gtr3</i> triple knock-out (tko), but was not seen in <i>gtr1 gtr2\u00a0double\u00a0knock-out</i> (dko) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>, [<a href=\"#bib4\">Andersen et al., 2013</a>]). In the rosette, there is a trend, but no statistically significant increase in indole glucosinolates of the <i>gtr3</i> mutant when compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The <i>gtr1 gtr2</i> dko shows a statistically significant increase in the rosette levels of indole glucosinolate that is further increased to 4 fold when also knocking out GTR3 (<i>gtr1 gtr2 gtr3</i> tko) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This suggests that GTR1, GTR2 and GTR3 all contribute to distributing indole glucosinolates between root and shoot. We used micro-grafting to further investigate the role of GTR1, GTR2 and GTR3 in the source-sink relationship for indole glucosinolates between root and rosette. As MYB28 and MYB29 \u2013 key regulators of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib70\">S\u00f8nderby et al., 2010b</a>) \u2013 are not necessary for expression of GTR1, GTR2 and GTR3 (<a href=\"#bib59\">M\u00fcller et al., 2010</a>), we could use the glucosinolate biosynthetic null mutant - <i>myb28/myb29 cyp79b2/cyp79b3</i> quadruple knockout (qko) - in micro-grafting experiments. By micro-grafting four-day-old <i>A. thaliana</i> seedlings of qko, <i>gtr1 gtr2 gtr3</i> tko and wild type plants we created reciprocal grafts of roots and rosettes from all genotypes and analyzed glucosinolate content in root and rosette of three-week-old grafted plants."

In agreement, distribution of aliphatic glucosinolates in heterografts of <i>gtr1 gtr2 gtr3</i> tko with wild type and qko plants, respectively, showed similar changes in distribution pattern for aliphatic glucosinolates as previously reported for heterografts of <i>gtr1 gtr2</i> dko with wild type and qko plants, respectively\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and [<a href=\"#bib4\">Andersen et al., 2013</a>]). Furthermore, the grafting procedure does not influence the glucosinolate distribution as evidenced by homografts of wild type and <i>gtr1 gtr2 gtr3</i> tko plants showing a similar distribution of indole glucosinolates as seen for non-grafted plants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), and by homografts of qko plants being devoid of indole glucosinolates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and [<a href=\"#bib4\">Andersen et al., 2013</a>]). Analysis of heterografted plants with no glucosinolate biosynthesis in the root showed that only small amounts of indole glucosinolates are transported from rosette to root. Similarly, it was evident from the (qko/wt) heterografts that when all three GTRs are expressed in the root, the root to rosette transport is below detection levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). However, when all three GTRs are knocked out in roots, we see a dramatic increase in the rosette indole glucosinolate content (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In combination, this suggests that GTR3 (along with GTR1 and GTR2) has a role in retaining indole glucosinolates in the root, presumably by importing indole glucosinolates into storage cells."

Either glucosinolate transport first arose with narrow specificity for indole glucosinolates followed by a broadening of the substrate specificity, or the reverse. To address this question and potentially determine when glucosinolate transport capability arose, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of NPF transporters from glucosinolate-producing species (<i>A. thaliana</i>, <i>Brassica rapa</i> and <i>Carica papaya</i>) and non-producing species (<i>Theobroma cacao</i> (cacao)<i>, Manihot esculenta</i> (cassava)<i>, Glycine max</i>, <i>Gossypium raimondi</i> and <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). The phylogenetic analyses revealed three well-defined <i>AtGTR1-, AtGTR2- and AtGTR3</i>-containing subclades with NPF sequences exclusively from glucosinolate-producing species of the <i>Brassicaceae</i> (<i>A. thaliana</i> and <i>B. rapa</i>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, the analyses revealed a subclade, which grouped basal to the three GTR1\u20133 subclades. This subclade, which we name the GTR-like subclade contained GTR homologs from <i>C. papaya,</i> the most basal glucosinolate-producing species in <i>Brassicales</i> with a sequenced genome (<a href=\"#bib57\">Mithen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Goodstein et al., 2012</a>), and from non-producing species (<i>M. truncatula</i>, <i>G. raimondii, S. lycopersicum, M. esculenta</i> and <i>T. cacao</i>).

All transporters described below were codon optimized for expression in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes and tested for transport activity in their native form (i.e. without tag). Additionally, we fused each gene to YFP in the C-terminus and confirmed its expression and localization to the plasmamembrane via confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In the following, lack of transport can therefore likely be attributed to lack of activity rather than lack of expression. Within the GTR1 and GTR3 subclades, we tested one of the respective orthologs from <i>B. rapa</i> and showed a strong preference for I3M by the tested BrGTR3 ortholog (BrH02396), whereas the tested BrGTR1 ortholog (BrF01711) transported 4MTB and I3M with similar efficiency (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Thus, the high preference for indole glucosinolates appears typical for GTR3 orthologs within the <i>Brassicales</i>-specific GTR3 subclade. Oocytes expressing GTR-like transporters from <i>C. papaya</i> over-accumulate both 4MTB and I3M relative to the assay media concentration and we named them <i>CARICA PAPAYA</i> Glucosinolate Transporter LIKE-1 (CpGTRL1) and \u22122 (CpGTRL2), respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The ability of CpGTRL1 and \u22122 to transport both 4MTB and I3M is surprising as indole glucosinolates are found in <i>A. thaliana</i> and <i>B. rapa</i>, but not in <i>C. papaya</i> (<a href=\"#bib57\">Mithen et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, CpGTRL2 from C. papaya transported 4MTB with a k<sub>m</sub> of 85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012 \u00b5M at \u221260 mV (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This indicates that the high affinity of GTRs towards glucosinolates evolved before the diversification of the <i>Brassicaceae</i> and <i>Caricaceae</i>. Moreover, the data imply that the common ancestor of the GTR transporters was originally broad-specific and that GTR3 lost the ability to over-accumulate aliphatic glucosinolates after the divergence of <i>C. papaya</i> and the ancestor of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Brassica</i> (~72.1 MYA, median of 8 studies [<a href=\"#bib36\">Hedges et al., 2006</a>]). This suggests that preference for indole glucosinolates evolved as a subfunctionalization of ancestral, broad-specific glucosinolate transporters."

As a control, we included GTR homologs from cacao, which produces neither compound class (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bjerg et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Seigler, 2005</a>). Oocytes expressing Me14G074000 from cassava over-accumulated both 4MTB and I3M relative to external media, while the expressed GTR homolog from cacao did not transport any glucosinolates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Hence, as cassava does not synthesize glucosinolates, the ability to transport glucosinolate appears to have arisen in the NPF family prior to the evolution of the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, the characterization of this potentially ancestral form of the glucosinolate transporters support that they first evolved with broad specificity towards aliphatic and indole glucosinolates."

Based on this and the existence of a transporter in cassava with glucosinolate transport capacity, we explored whether the glucosinolate NPF transporters may have evolved from cyanogenic glucoside transporters within the NPF family, much like glucosinolates evolved from cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bak et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Clausen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mithen et al., 2010</a>). To test this hypothesis we investigated the ability of selected GTRs and GTR-like homologs to transport representative cyanogenic glucosides, namely phenylalanine-derived prunasin and valine-derived linamarin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Notably, cassava produces only cyanogenic glucosides whereas <i>C. papaya</i> produces both cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates (derived from phenylalanine). Oocytes expressing the glucosinolate transporters from <i>C. papaya</i>, <i>B. rapa</i> and <i>A. thaliana</i> did not accumulate the tested cyanogenic glucosides above trace amounts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In comparison, oocytes expressing Me14G074000 from cassava accumulated prunasin, but not linamarin, to levels equivalent to media (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This indicates that the substrate-binding cavity of this NPF transporter can accommodate both cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates. As Me14G074000 transports both compound classes, we propose that this transporter may represent a transition phase where specificity for cyanogenic glucosides is partially lost in favor of glucosinolate transport. This suggests that glucosinolate transporters evolved from those of cyanogenic glucosides."

We tested this hypothesis by measuring transport activity of the six closest homologs of Me14G074000 from cassava (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The closest homolog, Me14G074100, appears truncated (data not shown) with only five transmembrane-spanning domains but was nevertheless included in our analysis. All six transporters were tested for transport activity in their native form. Additionally, we fused YFP to the C-terminus of each gene to validate expression. Native Me14G074100, Me01G191900, Me09G097200, and Me17G124600 did not result in uptake of 4MTB, I3M, prunasin or linamarin. Among the YFP-tagged transporters, only Me14G074100 and Me09G097200 did not express in the oocytes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and hence we cannot conclude whether these two transporters are inactive. Uptake of prunasin was detected in oocytes expressing Me15G176100 at levels similar to or slightly lower than the suggested \u2018transition\u2019 transporter (Me14G074000) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In contrast, Me15G180400 strongly over-accumulated prunasin and linamarin to more than 12 and 8 times the media level (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) while uptake of both aliphatic and indole glucosinolates by this transporter was negligible (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, Me15G180400 is specific towards cyanogenic glucosides. We named Me15G180400 MANIHOT ESCULENTA CYANOGENIC GLUCOSIDE TRANSPORTER-1 (MeCGTR1) and to the best of our knowledge, it represents the first identification of an importer of cyanogenic glucosides. TEVC electrophysiology assays showed that prunasin and linamarin induce negative currents in MeCGTR1-expressing oocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Kinetic analysis of MeCGTR1 showed that this protein transports prunasin and linamarin with a K<sub>m</sub> of 80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 \u00b5M and 262\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015 \u00b5M, respectively, measured at a membrane potential clamped to \u221260 mV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013F</a>). This indicates that MeCGTR1 is a high-affinity, cyanogenic glucoside-specific transporter and shows that it is capable of over-accumulating against a concentration gradient. The existence of MeCGTR1 supports our hypothesis that the dual-specific Me14G074000 represents a \u2018transition\u2019 transporter evolutionarily positioned between cyanogenic glucoside-specific (MeCGTR1) and glucosinolate-specific transporters (GTR1\u20133 and GTRL1\u20132). The identification and close phylogenetic relationship of glucosinolate-specific, dual-specific and cyanogenic glucoside-specific transporters within the NPF supports that glucosinolate transporters evolved from cyanogenic glucoside NPF transporters."

Characterization of the transporters identified in this study by both LCMS- and TEVC-based transport assays enabled us to investigate the evolution of electrogenicity of glucosinolate and cyanogenic glucoside transporters. Previously, we showed that AtGTR1 and \u22122 mediated transport of 4MTB induces negative currents as a result of net inward movement of protons during transport (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nour-Eldin et al., 2012</a>). In this study, we show that negative currents are also induced by both AtGTR1 and \u22122 when exposed to I3M (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This indicates that AtGTR1 and \u22122 transport 4MTB and I3M \u2013 two negatively charged glucosinolates with different amino acid side chains- via a similar electrogenic transport mechanism. Similarly, the tested GTR1 ortholog from <i>B. rapa</i> (BrGTR1) also induced negative currents when exposed to 4MTB or I3M (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In comparison, AtGTR3 and the GTR3 ortholog from <i>B. rapa</i> (BrGTR3) only induced currents when exposed to I3M (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). No detectable currents were induced by 4MTB in neither AtGTR3 nor BrGTR3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, it appears that electrogenic transport of - and the ability to upconcentrate - 4MTB is a property that distinguishes the GTR1 clade from the GTR3 clade. Similarly, exposure to cyanogenic glucosides did not induce currents in the putative transition transporter, Me14G074000; (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). In comparison, MeCGTR1 induced negative currents when exposed to the non-charged prunasin and linamarin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This suggests that transport of these two cyanogenic glucosides by MeCGTR1 is coupled to a net influx of cationic species and that transport of cyanogenic glucosides by MeCGTR1 and Me14G074000 appears to differ with respect to electrogenicity."

From the GTR-like clade, the glucosinolate transporting CpGTRL1 and CpGTRL2 induced currents when exposed to 4MTB or I3M (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) whereas Me14G074000 from cassava did not induce detectable currents (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). All three transporters were able to upconcentrate both glucosinolates against their respective concentration gradient (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Thus, our data suggest that the glucosinolate transport mechanism first arose as a non-electrogenic mechanism that later evolved to become electrogenic. Moreover, electrogenic transport appears not to be a prerequisite for the ability to over-accumulate glucosinolates. Previously, we showed that negative currents induced by AtGTR1 and AtGTR2 when exposed to the negatively charged glucosinolates, reflect a glucosinolate to proton stoichiometry of 1\u00a0\u2264\u00a02 (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nour-Eldin et al., 2012</a>). Substrate-dependent variation in transport coupling stoichiometry between substrate and protons has been shown to depend on the length of the oligo-peptide substrate for PepT<sub>So</sub> (<a href=\"#bib67\">Parker et al., 2014</a>). The non-electrogenic transport by Me14G074000 could indicate a different proton to glucosinolate stoichiometry compared to that of the <i>A. thaliana</i> orthologs. For example, the lack of detectable currents may be caused by an equal amount of negative and positive charges moving across the membrane during the transport cycle. This would suggest that changes in transporter substrate specificity for a given substrate are accompanied by changes in transporter electrogenicity. However, we cannot exclude that the lack of currents for Me14G074000 is caused by currents below detection limits or that co-transport of other ions may be \u00b4masking\u00b4 the coupled transport by Me14G074000. Nevertheless, the absence of induced currents by Me14G074000 indicates that transport of glucosinolates became electrogenic after the divergence of cassava and <i>C. papaya</i>."

By tracking the evolution of GTR transporter specificity towards glucosinolates, we propose that a duplication event introduced permissive mutations in a high affinity, electrogenic transporter of the ancestral cyanogenic glucosides (represented here by MeCGTR1) to generate a \u2018transition\u2019 transporter with broad, non-electrogenic glucosinolate specificity and non-electrogenic cyanogenic glucoside specificity (represented by Me14G074000) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). With the advent of glucosinolate biosynthesis and through further duplication and evolutionary divergence, our data suggests that the dual-specificity transporter lost its cyanogenic glucoside transport capacity and became a high affinity, electrogenic broad-specific glucosinolate transporter (represented by BrGTR1, AtGTRs, CpGTRL1 and CpGTRL2). The retainment of Me14G074000 in the cassava genome indicates that it may fulfill an important role in transport of cyanogenic glucosides despite its inferior transport properties compared to Me15G180400. Alternatively, its retainment could be explained by specificity towards other yet unidentified substrates. Presently, we can also not exclude that Me14G074000 represents an ancestral non-electrogenic, multi-specificity transporter, which through duplication and subfunctionalization gave rise to the electrogenic transporters with high affinity for cyanogenic glucosides (represented by MeCGTR1) and later for glucosinolates (represented by CpGTRL1, CpGTRL2, BrGTR1 and AtGTRs), respectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Further subfunctionalization within the GTR clade led to the evolution of the GTR3 subclade identified as transporters with preference and high affinity for indole glucosinolate. Thus, the subfunctionalization within the GTRs from broad to narrow specificity is contrary to the evolutionary dynamics proposed previously for substrate-transport evolution, where progenitor transporters had a narrow substrate specificity that expanded during evolution to become increasingly broad (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lionarons et al., 2012</a>)."

Several bacterial POTs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Doki et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Newstead et al., 2011</a>) and one plant NPF homolog (AtNPF6.3) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Parker and Newstead, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Sun et al., 2014</a>) have been crystalized along with their substrates. Hence, it is possible to discuss the substrate specificities determined in the present study in a structural context by analysing the amino acid residues that are key for substrate interaction. We constructed an alignment comprising the sequence of AtNPF6.3, the crystalized bacterial POTs and the glucosinolate and cyanogenic glucoside transporters investigated in this study (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). From the structural studies on bacterial POTs and NPF6.3 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Doki et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Parker and Newstead, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Sun et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aduri et al., 2015</a>), the key substrate interacting amino acid residues were compiled, numbered P1-P13 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and located in the alignment (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, we constructed homology models using the recent structure of NPF6.3 as a template and depicted amino acid positions P1-P13 within the models (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> inserts). Analysis of AtGTR1, AtGTR3, Me14g074000 and MeCGTR1 homology models showed the P1-P13 residues to be exposed to the central substrate binding cavity of the transporters (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) and therefore to constitute candidates for substrate specificity determining residues. Five residues (P1-P3, P8 and P13) were conserved in all genes in the alignment. These constitute the EXXE[R/K] motif that has an indispensable role in proton coupling (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib75\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aduri et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2015</a>). This suggests that the proton coupling mechanism is conserved regardless of the substrate specificity of a NPF transporter. Amino acid positions P7 and P9 are conserved respectively as asparagine and threonine across the GTR and cyanogenic glucoside transporters, whereas they are glycine and asparagine residues in POT transporters and phenylalanine and asparagine residues in NPF6.3. The only moiety shared between glucosinolates and cyanogenic glucosides is the glucose moiety. Thus, P7 and P9 could be involved in the interaction with the glucose moiety (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Amino acid positions P10-P12 are not conserved across the GTRs, NPF6.3 and the POT transporters and the mutational pattern does not correlate to the changes we have seen in substrate specificity. Consequently, the role of these residues remains unclear. In contrast, amino acid positions P4, P5 and P6 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> inserts) show a conservation pattern that is consistent with the changes in substrate specificity shown in this study. This indicates that position P4, P5 and P6 may contribute to determining the substrate specificity of glucosinolate and cyanogenic glucoside transporters. Despite recent advances in understanding substrate specificity of peptide transporters (as outlined above), nothing is currently known about amino acid changes that determine transporter substrate specificity from an evolutionary perspective. Our work provides a framework for future studies to determine the amino acid changes that leads to substrate specificity changes during evolution of metabolite transporters."

Towards understanding the evolutionary paths that lead to new transporter substrate specificities, we show that before a substrate emerges, transporter specificity for the substrate may be present in transporters of chemically similar, more ancient substrates. As new substrates emerges (in this case glucosinolates), gene duplications allows such multifunctional transporters to diversify through subfunctionalization into transporters with greater specificity for the new substrate."

We propose that redundant ancestral transporters created by gene duplication remain active due to a multifunctional specificity. When the new substrate emerges these ancestral transporters can be recruited and evolve into transporters with greater specificity for the new compound. Moreover, from a mechanistic perspective, our data suggests that the evolution of new substrate specificities in coupled secondary transporters is accompanied by changes in the electrogenic properties of the transport mechanism. Unraveling the structural determinants underpinning stoichiometry and binding of substrate constitutes a new frontier for understanding the birth and development of new transporter substrate specificities at the molecular level. This not only applies to the universal NPF transporters, including their drug-delivering mammalian counterparts (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brandsch, 2013</a>), but for transporters in general. From an agro-biotech perspective, the identification of a cyanogenic glucoside transporter with high apparent affinity supports a prominent role for NPF transporters in specialized metabolism (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nour-Eldin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nour-Eldin and Halkier, 2013</a>) and opens new possibilities for controlling cyanogenic glucoside content in edible parts of crops such as bitter almond (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dicenta et al., 2002</a>), barley (<a href=\"#bib27\">Erb et al., 1979</a>) and cassava (<a href=\"#bib55\">McMohan et al., 1995</a>) through transport engineering strategies (<a href=\"#bib63\">Nour-Eldin and Halkier, 2013</a>)."

Each coding sequence was surrounded by the 8 bp USER tails that enable insertion into the USER compatible <i>X. laevis</i> expression vector pNB1u (<a href=\"#bib33\">Geu-Flores et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Nour-Eldin et al., 2006</a>). Each fragment contained a uracil at the appropriate location in each USER tail. The uracil was incorporated during synthesis. Thus, uStrings are mixed directly with the digested pNB1u vector without prior PCR amplification with uracil containing primers. Briefly, each uString was diluted to 100 ng/ul in H<sub>2</sub>0. The USER-compatible pNB1u <i>X. laevis</i> oocyte expression vector was digested with <i>PacI</i>/<i>Nt.BbvCI</i> overnight, gel purified and diluted to a concentration of\u00a0~50 ng/ul (as previously described [<a href=\"#bib64\">Nour-Eldin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">MacAulay et al., 2001</a>]). For the USER reaction, 100 ng uStrings was mixed with 50 ng digested pNB1u, 1 unit USER enzyme (NEB-M5505S), 2 \u00b5l 5xPCR reaction buffer and 5 \u00b5l H<sub>2</sub>0. The reaction was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 25 min, followed by 25 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was used to transform chemically competent <i>E. coli</i> cells, plated on carbinicilin-containing LB plates. Selected colonies were grown overnight and extracted plasmids sequenced. All uStrings were inserted successfully into the pNB1u vector and out of the 13 genes synthesized and cloned, we had to sequence a second colony for only one of the genes. The fidelity and efficiency of cloning uStrings directly by USER cloning is satisfactory."

They found that the evolution of the specificity for glucosinolates from earlier transporters of cyanogenic glucosides proceeded through a broad specificity transporter, capable of transporting both type of substrates. Once glucosinoalte specificity emerged, some of the family members became more narrowly specialized for specific glucosinolates. Interestingly, during evolutionary transition of the specificity from cyanogenic glucosides to glucosinolates, the broad-specificity transporter showed non-electrogenic transport of cyanogenic glucosides, which contrasts with both earlier and later members, which all showed proton-driven transport."

It is odd that in a family of H-coupled transporters, there would be one that takes up relevant substrate, cyanogenic glucoside in a non-coupled manner.

From the apparent lack of currents it can be concluded that the uptake is coupled to 1 proton, but the substrate concentrations used in this experiment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) are very low. How will the currents look like at higher 4MTB concentrations, where the uptake is more significant? Substrate-dependent currents should be examined and coupling mechanism should be established as it is very surprising that the mechanism seems to be 1:1 yet there is no accumulation in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>.

While we understand why these organisms have been chosen, we feel hat their individual choice and the number of tested transporters and species (here only 1 each) is too small to fully support these very important conclusions.

We would argue that based on the data presented, it is not possible to make definitive statements about stoichiometry of transport. Specifically, we think that the presence of concentrative transport is clearly indicative of ion-coupled transport. Such concentrative transport is demonstrated for the uptake of glucosinolates by Me14G0176100 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) as well as by GTR1s and GTR3s (I3M). In contrast, transport of cyanogenic glucosides by Me14G0176100 is not concentrative (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6 A and C</a>). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that it is not ion-coupled. However, the presence or absence of current is difficult to interpret based on the reported relatively preliminary electrophysiology experiments. For example, the observed current might be due to an uncoupled conductance that accompanies coupled transport and not due to stoichiometry of &gt;2H<sup>+</sup> per substrate. In that regard, we note that GTR1s and Me14G0176100 accumulate glucosinolates to a similar extent. Would not one expect GTR1s to concentrate substrates to a greater extent than Me14G0176100 if they operated with higher proton: substrate stoichiometry? Furthermore, the absence of current might be simply a consequence of slow rate of transport that would not allow detection of the ion flux. More detailed studies would need to be conducted to resolve these questions. We recognize that these go beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We urge the authors to re-evaluate their conclusions on the coupling mechanisms and to re-formulate them in more speculative, hypothetical terms."

My hunch is that Me14g74000 is proton coupled, as it contains all the necessary residues identified in POT family transporters \u2013 namely P1, 2, 3 and P13 as described here. It is certainly possible that a change in substrate specificity would be accompanied by a change in stoichiometry. It would have been satisfying if further experimental evidence was provided to support this hypothesis, as this could be an important factor in the evolution of the binding site and transporters. However, I can see that this would increase the remit of the study beyond identification."

Incidently, P13 is likely not involved in peptide specificity but in proton translocation, as it is also essential for NRT1.1 function.

Specifically, the reviewers and the editor argued that the presence or absence of currents cannot be used conclusively to determine the stoichiometry of transport. They have suggested that the corresponding section of the manuscript was rewritten in more speculative terms. However, the revised manuscript contains more definitive description of stoichiometry, which the Reviewing Editor deems inappropriate. Moreover, the new version seems to contain erroneous statements. For example, in one case the authors write: \"[\u2026]the apparent coupling stoichiometry changes specifically to 1:1 for aliphatic glucosinolates (no 4MTB over-accumulation, no induced currents)[\u2026]\". This does not seem to make sense. If there is 1:1 coupling, there should be concentrative transport and over-accumulation. We again urge the authors to rewrite the paragraph in less definitive more speculative terms and remove the corresponding stoichiometry table, which, in our opinion, over-interprets the data. If the authors disagree with us, we would like to hear their arguments as the letter accompanying the re-submitted manuscript does contain any discussion of the concerns raised by the reviewers and the Editor."

We would argue that based on the data presented, it is not possible to make definitive statements about stoichiometry of transport. Specifically, we think that the presence of concentrative transport is clearly indicative of ion-coupled transport. Such concentrative transport is demonstrated for the uptake of glucosinolates by Me14G0176100 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) as well as by GTR1s and GTR3s (I3M). In contrast, transport of cyanogenic glucosides by Me14G0176100 is not concentrative (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6 A and C</a>). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that it is not ion-coupled. However, the presence or absence of current is difficult to interpret based on the reported relatively preliminary electrophysiology experiments. For example, the observed current might be due to an uncoupled conductance that accompanies coupled transport and not due to stoichiometry of &gt;2H<sup>+</sup> per substrate. In that regard, we note that GTR1s and Me14G0176100 accumulate glucosinolates to a similar extent. Would not one expect GTR1s to concentrate substrates to a greater extent than Me14G0176100 if they operated with higher proton: substrate stoichiometry? Furthermore, the absence of current might be simply a consequence of slow rate of transport that would not allow detection of the ion flux. More detailed studies would need to be conducted to resolve these questions. We recognize that these go beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We urge the authors to re-evaluate their conclusions on the coupling mechanisms and to re-formulate them in more speculative, hypothetical terms.</i>"

We report that the transport mechanism by which glucosinolates and cyanogenic glucosides are transported by the potential transition transporter Me14g074000 does not induce currents. This is in contrast to substrate transport by MeCGTR1 and At/Br/CpGTRs which all induce strong negative currents when exposed to their substrate. This indicates that there is a difference in the electrogenecity of the underlying transport mechanism. We then suggest that future studies should be aimed at unravelling whether the changes in electrogenicity are caused by changes in stoichiometry."
