Yet, it has remained a riddle how bacteria invade the fungal cells. Genome mining for potential symbiosis factors and functional analyses revealed that a type 2 secretion system (T2SS) of the bacterial endosymbiont is required for the formation of the endosymbiosis. Comparative proteome analyses show that the T2SS releases chitinolytic enzymes (chitinase, chitosanase) and chitin-binding proteins. The genes responsible for chitinolytic proteins and T2SS components are highly expressed during infection. Through targeted gene knock-outs, sporulation assays and microscopic investigations we found that chitinase is essential for bacteria to enter hyphae. Unprecedented snapshots of the traceless bacterial intrusion were obtained using cryo-electron microscopy. Beyond unveiling the pivotal role of chitinolytic enzymes in the active invasion of a fungus by bacteria, these findings grant unprecedented insight into the fungal cell wall penetration and symbiosis formation."

Yet, it has remained a riddle how bacteria invade the fungal cells. Genome mining for potential symbiosis factors and functional analyses revealed that a type 2 secretion system (T2SS) of the bacterial endosymbiont is required for the formation of the endosymbiosis. Comparative proteome analyses show that the T2SS releases chitinolytic enzymes (chitinase, chitosanase) and chitin-binding proteins. The genes responsible for chitinolytic proteins and T2SS components are highly expressed during infection. Through targeted gene knock-outs, sporulation assays and microscopic investigations we found that chitinase is essential for bacteria to enter hyphae. Unprecedented snapshots of the traceless bacterial intrusion were obtained using cryo-electron microscopy. Beyond unveiling the pivotal role of chitinolytic enzymes in the active invasion of a fungus by bacteria, these findings grant unprecedented insight into the fungal cell wall penetration and symbiosis formation."

This frees up nutrients that nourish both the fungus and the bacteria. <i>B. rhizoxinica</i> lives inside the tissues of the fungus, but to do so the bacterial cells must first travel through the tough cell walls of the fungus. How these bacteria do this without also damaging the fungus was unknown."

On analyzing the proteins released by this system, Moebius et al. identified several enzymes that help the bacteria attach to the fungal cell wall and soften it so that the bacteria can penetrate into the cell. Only small amounts of enzyme are needed for the softening process, meaning that penetrating the cell wall is a relatively gentle process that causes no lasting damage to the fungus. Moebius et al. also captured images of the bacteria invading the fungal cells using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, and provide the first known images of this type of infection in progress."

Beyond the most commonly observed microbial cell\u2013cell interactions, there is a growing number of known endosymbioses where bacteria dwell within fungal hyphae (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bonfante and Anca, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kobayashi and Crouch, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lackner et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Frey-Klett et al., 2011</a>). Symbioses with endofungal bacteria are often overlooked, yet they may have a profound effect on the host's lifestyle. Bacterial endosymbionts of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, for example, might be implicated in the vitamin B12 provision for the fungus (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ghignone et al., 2012</a>). Endobacteria <i>Rhizobium radiobacter</i>, isolated from the mycorrhizal fungus, exhibit the same growth promoting effects and induce systemic resistance to plant pathogenic fungi in the same way that the fungus harboring the endobacteria does. Thus, it was proposed that the beneficial effects for the plant result directly from the presence of bacteria (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sharma et al., 2008</a>). The rice seedling blight fungus, <i>Rhizopus microsporus</i>, and its endosymbiont bacterium, <i>Burkholderia rhizoxinica</i> represent a particularly noteworthy example of a bacterial-fungal endosymbiosis (<a href=\"#bib46\">Partida-Martinez and Hertweck, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lackner and Hertweck, 2011</a>). The fungus harbors endosymbionts of the genus <i>Burkholderia</i>, which reside within the fungal cytosol, as shown by confocal laser scanning microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (EM) and freeze\u2013fracture EM (<a href=\"#bib44\">Partida-Martinez et al., 2007a</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2007b</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2007c</a>). The bacteria are harnessed by the fungus as producers of highly potent antimitotic macrolides (<a href=\"#bib54\">Scherlach et al., 2006</a>), which are then further processed by the host into the phytotoxin rhizoxin (<a href=\"#bib52\">Scherlach et al., 2012</a>). The toxin represents the causative agent of rice seedling blight, which weakens or kills the rice plants (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lackner et al., 2009b</a>). Both the saprotrophic fungus and the endofungal bacteria benefit from the nutrients released, and <i>R. microsporus</i> provides a protective shelter for the bacterial partner. The <i>Rhizopus-Burkholderia</i> association also stands out as it employs an elegant mechanism that allows the persistence and spreading of the symbiosis through spores containing the endosymbionts (<a href=\"#bib47\">Partida-Martinez et al., 2007c</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Yet it is unknown how the vegetative reproduction of the fungus has become totally dependent upon the presence of the endobacteria (<a href=\"#bib47\">Partida-Martinez et al., 2007c</a>). Insights into the genome of <i>B. rhizoxinica</i> and mutational studies have unveiled several symbiosis factors (<a href=\"#bib36\">Leone et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lackner et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2011b</a>)."

The rhizoxin complex secreted by the bacteria arrests mitosis in almost all eukaryotic cells. Yet, <i>Rhizopus</i>, amongst other zygomycetes, has gained resistance to this toxin due to a mutation at the \u03b2-tubulin binding site (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schmitt et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses point to host switching events during evolution (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lackner et al., 2009a</a>), which is also supported by the engagement of an <i>hrp</i> locus of <i>B. rhizoxinica</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lackner et al., 2011a</a>). In addition to this, the LPS layer of the <i>B. rhizoxinica</i> is known to be unique to its niche, due to high resemblance to fungal sugar content (<a href=\"#bib36\">Leone et al., 2010</a>). Although there is ample knowledge on the persistence of the symbiosis, it has remained fully enigmatic how the bacteria enter the fungal cells.

Yet, this knowledge is limited to the invasion of human, animal and plant cells.

However, despite a growing number of described fungal endobacteria (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lackner et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Frey-Klett et al., 2011</a>), there is a striking lack of knowledge about the avenues and active mechanisms that permit fusion with or entry into fungal hyphae, where the fungus is left intact to serve as a host for the endobacteria.

Thus, we mined the gene repertoire of <i>B. rhizoxinica</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lackner, 2011b</a>) for potential molecular infection mechanisms known from pathogenic bacteria. A type 2 secretion system (T2SS), also called general secretion pathway (gsp), encoded by a 12 kb gene cluster on the <i>B. rhizoxinica</i> chromosome (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) seemed to be a promising candidate to enable the bacterium to enter the host. T2SS are typically involved in the secretion of various toxins and lytic enzymes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cianciotto, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Korotkov et al., 2012</a>) and the overall organization of T2SS gene clusters is well conserved between related species (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We generated targeted deletion mutants to investigate the role of the T2SS in the infection process. Specifically, we selected <i>gspC</i> and <i>gspD</i>, since their gene products are essential proteins of the type 2 secretion machinery in related bacteria (<a href=\"#bib13\">DeShazer et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Korotkov et al., 2011</a>). The outer membrane pore is formed presumably by the multimeric secretin GspD, and GspC appears to link the inner and outer membranes by providing the contact to GspD via a homology region (<a href=\"#bib28\">Korotkov et al., 2011</a>). Although it is notoriously difficult to genetically modify the symbiotic bacteria, we succeeded in generating \u0394<i>gspC</i> and \u0394<i>gspD</i> mutants using a double-crossover strategy."

The secretome analysis of the T2SS mutants showed a substantial reduction in the total protein yield (0.1% \u00b1 0\u2013015% of the wt secretome) despite an intense protein precipitation with fivefold TCA and the requirement of 100 \u00b5g of protein from each samples to be loaded on 2-D gel electrophoresis. In the wt secretome we identified surprisingly few proteins, although they were present in great abundance. Using MALDI-TOF we were able to detect the majority of the secreted proteins as chitin-binding protein (Cbp) and chitosanase (Chts), which are encoded in the bacterial genome. The chitin-binding protein belongs to the non-catalytic carbohydrate-binding proteins of the CBM33 family (<a href=\"#bib21\">Henrissat and Davies, 2000</a>), which can bind to chitin and facilitate the action of chitinases. The chitosanase is part of the glycoside hydrolase family 46 with a specific hydrolytic activity on chitosan (<a href=\"#bib21\">Henrissat and Davies, 2000</a>)."

While screening the <i>B. rhizoxinica</i> genome for genes for chitinolytic enzymes, we also detected a gene for a chitinase that contains a signal sequence for secretion. The corresponding gene product could also in fact be detected by 2-D gel electrophoresis and MALDI analysis, albeit in lower abundance than Cbp and Chts.

Previous mutational studies of various T2SS have provided evidence of their involvement in pathogenesis (<a href=\"#bib13\">DeShazer et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ali et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Roy Chowdhury and Heinemann, 2006</a>). T2SS may also be absent in pathogens, and several T2SS of mutualists have already been described (<a href=\"#bib15\">Filloux, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cianciotto, 2005</a>). However, they are absent in some well-studied aphid and insect symbionts (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cianciotto, 2005</a>). In a recent report on the T2SS of the obligate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus symbiont <i>Candidatus</i> Glomeribacter gigasporarum, it was shown that the expression of the gene coding for GspD was up-regulated in the obligate symbiont (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ghignone et al., 2012</a>).

In this study we found that the deletion of the chitinase (<i>chi</i>) gene completely abolished the bacteria's ability to enter the fungal hyphae and thus rendering it incapable of establishing a functional symbiosis. The deletion of two additional genes coding for a chitin-binding protein and a chitosanase showed no effect on the sporulation assay. However, these two enzymes are present in great abundance in the <i>B. rhizoxinica</i> wt secretome and likely support the action of chitinase. This idea of these enzymes' function is further supported by the fact that the chitosan is highly abundant in the cell wall of zygomycetes (and fungi in general) and that secretion of both proteins is highly reduced in the T2SS mutants, which are unable to intrude the fungus."

Chitin binding protein (Cbp) is the most abundant protein in the cell-free supernatant of <i>B. rhizoxinica</i>, and its expression levels are higher in co-culture with the host fungus. We therefore assume that Cbp facilitates bacterial attachment to the fungal hyphae and renders the chitin matrix more accessible to chitinase degradation as it was proposed for family 33 Cbps. Small Cbps also promote the recognition and degradation of chitin by streptomycetes (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schrempf, 2001</a>). Chitin-binding proteins could play a role in various close interactions where bacteria attach to the hyphal surface and form fibrillar structures, as in specific <i>Streptomyces-Aspergillus</i> (<a href=\"#bib60\">Siemieniewicz and Schrempf, 2007</a>) and <i>Paenibacillus-Fusarium</i> co-cultures (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dijksterhuis et al., 1999</a>).

However, chitosanase likely supports the invasion process. To establish an intimate association, the physical contact must occur at the right time and the right place and may be dependent upon many factors (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bright and Bulgheresi, 2010</a>). The microscopic images and the gene expression studies indicate that the bacteria attach themselves to the fungus even before the chitinolytic enzymes are produced and secreted. In this way low concentrations of lytic enzymes would be sufficient for local activity. Thus, fungal cell wall penetration is a more melting-like, mild process without damaging the hyphae. A similar scenario has been described in the context of plant infection, where the precise and highly localized cellulolytic activity of cellulase CelC2 from <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> bv. <i>trifolii</i> degrades the host plant cell wall during penetration (<a href=\"#bib49\">Robledo et al., 2008</a>)."

This process is observed very locally for every bacterium, even when several bacteria form fusion structures close to each other on the fungal cell wall. Although parts of the penetrated cell wall may appear a bit irregular (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), there are no visible signs of cell lysis or loss of integrity surrounding the intrusion sites. Both, the mutants lacking chitinase or T2SS components attach in a comparable yet weaker fashion to the fungal hyphae but are not capable of similar fusion events (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I\u2013J</a>). Moreover, cell membrane staining to fungus has shown that the fungus does not engulf the bacterium by endocytosis. Overall, this strategy permits a traceless entry into the fungal cells, thus guaranteeing that host integrity is not affected."

Flanking regions upstream and downstream of the selected gene were amplified using a proof-reading polymerase with primers containing 20 bp homologous to the flanking region and 20 additional bp targeting the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 end of a kanamycin cassette. The same 20 bp have been used for primers amplifying a kanamycin cassette from pK19 as template. A triple overlapping PCR was performed with equimolar amounts of the flanking PCR fragments and a twofold amount of the kanamycin cassette PCR product using PhusionFlash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The yielded fragments were subsequently transformed into pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and after restriction digest ligated into pGL42a. Knockout constructs for cbp and chts were obtained following the previous described amplification method (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lackner et al., 2011a</a>). The vectors pNM89 (GspC), pNM91 (GspD), pZU02 (Chi), pGL47 (Chts) and pGL49 (Cbp) were introduced into competent cells of <i>B. rhizoxinica</i> by electroporation. Transformants were selected on standard nutrient agar supplemented with 50 \u00b5g ml<sup>\u22121</sup> kanamycin. Colonies were inoculated in liquid MCGAVT medium (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lackner et al., 2011a</a>) for 3 to 4 days and subsequently spread on MCGAVT agar plates to obtain single colonies. This procedure was repeated several times and obtained clones were checked for correct integration of the knockout construct into the genome via PCR targeting an internal fragment of the respective gene (int) the <i>pheS</i> gene (pheS) as well as a region spanning the two recombination sites with ArmA and ArmB amplifying wt fragments and ArmC and Arm D mutant fragments, respectively.

Equal amounts of protein samples from <i>B. rhizoxinica</i> wt and mutant's pure culture as well as the respective cocultures were applied via anodic cup loading to IPG strips. Isoelectric focusing was conducted according to the following protocol: 4 hr at 300 V (gradient), 3 hr at 600 V (gradient), 4 hr at 1000 V (gradient), 5 hr at 8000 V (gradient) and 48,000 V hr at 8000 V (step). Subsequently strips were equilibrated for 10 min in 10 ml of equilibration buffer (6 M urea, 30% [vol/vol] glycerol, 2% [wt/vol] SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), 75 mM Tris, 0.002% [wt/vol] bromophenol blue) containing 1% (wt/vol) DTT and subsequently for 10 min in 10 ml of equilibration buffer containing 2.5% (wt/vol) iodoacetamide. Ettan DALT System (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to separate proteins in the second dimension. SDS polyacrylamide gels (Mini-Protean TGX Precast Gels, AnyKD, BIORAD Hercules, CA) were loaded with the strips and run for 50 min at 200 V. In order to identify the proteins by mass spectrometry (MS), the gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue according to <a href=\"#bib26\">Kniemeyer et al. (2006)</a> followed by manual excision of the spots. Protein spots were tryptically digested (<a href=\"#bib59\">Shevchenko et al., 1996</a>). Extracted peptides were measured and identified on an Ultraflex I and Ultraflextreme MALDI-TOF/TOF device using flexControl 3.3 for data collection and flexAnalysis 3.3 spectra analysis/peak list generation (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) and peptide fragmentation fingerprint (PFF) spectra were submitted to the MASCOT server (MASCOT 2.3, Matrix Science, London, UK), searching the <i>B. rhizoxinica</i> database."

At this stage it is technically impossible to co-express mutated versions of chitinase, but I trust the reviewers do not believe that the chitinase gene product does not play a structural role, given the successful demonstration of chitinase activity by heterologous expression."

We refrained from pursuing such inhibitor experiments because it was not possible to obtain any commercially available Family 18 specific inhibitors, and it could not be guaranteed that they would be specific for the symbionts's chitinase. In addition, the bacterial symbionts are typically embedded in a matrix of exopolysaccharides, which also hampers mutant selection with antibiotics. Thus, the chances that chitinase inhibitors would provide clear-cut results are low. We are convinced that the functional analyses using the chitinase gene knockout described in this study provide a much clearer result."

After one hour of co-incubation, we observed bacteria attached to the fungus but no fungal membrane surrounding the bacterium. After five hours, we detected bacteria within the hyphae, and again no fungal membrane was visible. We added micrographs to the paper as new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>.
