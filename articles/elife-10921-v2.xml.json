However, the relationship between human transcript diversity and protein production is complex as each isoform can be translated differently. We fractionated a polysome profile and reconstructed transcript isoforms from each fraction, which we term Transcript Isoforms in Polysomes sequencing (TrIP-seq). Analysis of these data revealed regulatory features that control ribosome occupancy and translational output of each transcript isoform. We extracted a panel of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions that control protein production from an unrelated gene in cells over a 100-fold range. Select 5\u2032 untranslated regions exert robust translational control between cell lines, while 3\u2032 untranslated regions can confer cell type-specific expression. These results expose the large dynamic range of transcript-isoform-specific translational control, identify isoform-specific sequences that control protein output in human cells, and demonstrate that transcript isoform diversity must be considered when relating RNA and protein levels."

However, the relationship between human transcript diversity and protein production is complex as each isoform can be translated differently. We fractionated a polysome profile and reconstructed transcript isoforms from each fraction, which we term Transcript Isoforms in Polysomes sequencing (TrIP-seq). Analysis of these data revealed regulatory features that control ribosome occupancy and translational output of each transcript isoform. We extracted a panel of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions that control protein production from an unrelated gene in cells over a 100-fold range. Select 5\u2032 untranslated regions exert robust translational control between cell lines, while 3\u2032 untranslated regions can confer cell type-specific expression. These results expose the large dynamic range of transcript-isoform-specific translational control, identify isoform-specific sequences that control protein output in human cells, and demonstrate that transcript isoform diversity must be considered when relating RNA and protein levels."

In humans, there is a median of five annotated transcript isoforms per gene, with more than 80 annotated isoforms in some cases (Ensembl release 75). These transcript isoforms arise from the combined action of alternative transcription initiation, splicing and cleavage, and polyadenylation, which are often cell\u00a0type specific (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Mele et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Merkin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Xiong et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Zheng and Black, 2013</a>).

Ribosome profiling is not well-suited for measuring transcript isoform-specific translation, primarily due to the short ~30 bp length of ribosome-protected fragments (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ingolia, 2014</a>). Prior attempts to characterize isoform-specific translation have measured the effects of 5\u2032 end diversity in yeast (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</a>) and 3\u2032 end diversity in mouse cells (<a href=\"#bib81\">Spies et al., 2013</a>), or splicing differences between cytoplasmic and aggregate polysomal mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib57\">Maslon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Sterne-Weiler et al., 2013</a>). However, sequencing just the ends of transcripts cannot distinguish between transcript isoforms of the same gene harboring degenerate termini. In addition, aggregating polysome fractions averages lowly- and highly-ribosome-associated messages. Therefore, a different strategy is required to understand how the diversity of the human transcriptome impacts translational output."

By using high gradient resolution and sequencing depth, this approach yields polysome profiles for over 60,000 individual transcript isoforms representing almost 14,000 protein coding genes. We observe frequent intron retention on ribosome-associated transcripts, even in high-polysome fractions, identifying a population of retained but not nuclear-detained introns (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boutz et al., 2015</a>). Properties of 3\u2032 untranslated regions predominate over the 5\u2032 leader sequence as the driving force behind differential polysome association for transcript isoforms of the same gene among the transcript features tested. We show that regulatory sequences differentially included in transcript isoforms of the same gene are modular and can trigger differences in the translation of reporters spanning two orders of magnitude. These findings provide a lens through which to ascribe functional consequences to RNA-seq-generated transcriptomes. Moreover, TrIP-seq analysis uncovers regulatory elements that can be utilized to tune translation of synthetic messages robustly in cells."

Clustering of the samples recapitulates the gradient order (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating the polysome profile was accurately fractionated. Four subgroups emerge from this clustering: the 80S (monosome), low polysomes (two-four ribosomes), high polysomes (five-eight+ ribosomes), and total cytoplasmic RNA. We tested the robustness of the clustering of samples by computing the average Jaccard distance between clusters from data subjected to three different resampling methods, which was \u22650.75, suggesting stable clusters (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>; Materials and methods). This suggests that in cells, transcript isoforms are predominantly poorly- or highly-ribosome associated, causing low polysomes to cluster away from high polysomes, which could be have numerous biological origins including highly abundant short ORFs."

                                "text": "To confirm the sequencing data, we first analyzed beta-actin (<i>ACTB</i>), which is known to be heavily translated with many ribosomes on each message, and migrates with high polysomes in a gradient (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; (<a href=\"#bib83\">Sterne-Weiler et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). However, <i>ACTB</i> only has one transcript isoform, so we examined <i>ATF4</i>, which has one dominant isoform exhibiting low-polysome association in TrIP-seq data and by RT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), consistent with it being translationally repressed in the absence of cellular stress (<a href=\"#bib33\">Harding et al., 2000</a>). We then analyzed eukaryotic elongation factor 1 beta 2 (<i>EEF1B2</i>), which has three isoforms with the same coding sequence but alternative 5\u2032 leaders as a representative gene that exhibits isoform-specific ribosome association (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The isoform-specific polysome profiles and RT-PCR conducted from polysome fractions agree qualitatively, validating the accuracy of the isoform-level quantifications (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Weaker amplification of the longer isoform (EEF1B2-003) in high polysomes may be due to PCR bias towards smaller amplicons (<a href=\"#bib95\">Walsh et al., 1992</a>), and replicate experiments show EEF1B2-003 present in high polysomes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We additionally validated the TrIP-seq data using qRT-PCR from polysome fractions and find that the two measurements agree for both <i>EEF1B2</i> and <i>SRSF5</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Both coding mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) associate with ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ingolia et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">van Heesch et al., 2014</a>), so we measured their polysomal abundance. Protein-coding genes and isoforms are found across the polysome, but noncoding and lncRNA genes are predominantly in the low polysome fractions indicating that they are generally weakly ribosome associated or in other large macromolecular complexes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

First, we reanalyzed a ribosome profiling dataset from HEK 293T cells and compared the number of ribosome-protected fragments to a weighted sum of the TrIP-seq polysome reads (Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods; n<sub>ribo</sub> \u22652) (<a href=\"#bib79\">Sidrauski et al., 2015</a>). We observe a strong correlation between ribosome profiling and TrIP-seq at the gene level (R<sub>S</sub> = 0.88; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). However, at the isoform level, the correlation decreases (R<sub>S</sub> = 0.47), which is worse than the correlation between TrIP-seq replicates (R<sub>S</sub> = 0.90; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), suggesting the discrepancy is not due to variability in TrIP-seq but instead is likely due to known issues quantifying transcript isoforms in ribosome profiling (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ingolia, 2014</a>). We next computed the translation efficiency (TE) of ribosome profiling and TrIP-seq data by dividing by cytoplasmic RNA levels. TE measured by the two methods correlated with R<sub>S</sub> = 0.24, perhaps due to variability in culture conditions or in either technique. We compared the data of Sidrauski <i>et al</i> to an unpublished ribosome profiling dataset in 293T cells from the Yoon-Jae Cho lab. Ribosome-protected fragments between experiments correlate with R<sub>S</sub> = 0.78, while TE has a substantially lower correlation of R<sub>S</sub> = 0.41, suggesting biological or technical variability disproportionately affects TE. We then compared TrIP-seq data to protein abundances from HEK 293T cells, and find that the two datasets correlate (R<sub>S</sub> = 0.57, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>, (<a href=\"#bib25\">Geiger et al., 2012</a>), which is better than RNA-seq (R<sub>S</sub> = 0.45; not shown). The observations that most translational stalling in mammalian cells is transient and translation elongation rates are homogeneous (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>), TrIP-seq appears to underestimate rather than overestimate protein abundance (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), and TrIP-seq correlates well at the gene-level with ribosome profiling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) suggest that TrIP-seq primarily measures translating ribosome association as opposed RNAs bound to other large complexes."

In sum, clustering of isoform abundance distributions across polysomes immediately provides insight into the diverse patterns of ribosome association by individual isoforms and transcript types in cells, and reveals intron-rich clusters of transcripts associated with polysomes that escape nuclear detention."

We selected 24 features to explore that are involved in translational control, such as the length of the coding sequence and untranslated regions, predicted secondary structure, and microRNA binding sites. As their average polysome profiles and composition are broadly similar (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), we merged clusters 1 and 2 to generate a larger pool of high-polysome isoforms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), and compared these to cluster 6, representing poorly translated isoforms in low polysomes.

However, the length of the coding sequence is not the sole determinant of polysome association, since the ribosome density (measured by dividing the weighted sum of TrIP-seq polysome reads by the number of cytoplasmic reads) is also higher in gene-linked isoforms found in high polysomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We also find that transcripts from gene-linked isoforms with more exons also tend to be better translated, as was observed using reporter genes (<a href=\"#bib65\">Nott et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">2004</a>). This is not due to overall transcript length, as there is no significant difference between transcript length in gene-linked isoforms, reflecting a positive influence of splicing on translation. Highly translated isoforms contain fewer rare codons on average, but contain more stretches of rare codons, perhaps indicating a need for translational pausing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The observation that exons promote translatability has been shown for select genes, and here we show that this extends across the human genome."

Specifically, we find that gene-linked 3\u2032 UTRs in low polysomes are considerably longer than those on high polysomes (mean length 1551 nt versus 982 nt). There are numerous regulatory elements contained within 3\u2032 UTRs, including microRNA binding sites, AU-rich elements, and protein-binding sites (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bartel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Szostak and Gebauer, 2013</a>). The fraction of the 3\u2032 UTR containing AU-rich elements is increased in low polysome gene-linked isoforms, possibly due to translational repression (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Moore et al., 2014</a>). Conserved predicted binding sites for miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Garcia et al., 2011</a>) are also more abundant in poorly translated gene-linked isoforms, but this could be due to a correlation between 3\u2032 UTR length and the number of miRNA binding sites. We, therefore, filtered the miRNAs to those bound to AGO1 or AGO2 in HEK 293T cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ender et al., 2008</a>). In this HEK 293T-expressed miRNA set, the difference for both the number of conserved miRNA binding sites and their score increases between gene-linked isoforms, suggesting that miRNA binding may be functionally relevant in this context (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Increased AU-rich elements and miRNA binding should lead to decreased half-life for low polysome isoforms, which is borne out in half-life comparisons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; [(<a href=\"#bib86\">Tani et al., 2012</a>])."

There are at least three possibilities that could explain this result. First, RNA structures can both repress or promote translation in a context dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib106\">Xue et al., 2015</a>), so it is possible that some isoforms are being driven to high polysomes by recruitment of transacting factors. Second, recent studies of global RNA secondary structure have consistently observed different structure in cells than in vitro (<a href=\"#bib74\">Rouskin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Spitale et al., 2015</a>). Lastly, HEK 293T cells may translate messages with inhibitory 5\u2032 leaders more efficiently than other cell types. In contrast, we find no significant dependence for the length of the 5\u2032 leader region on polysome association based on this comparison (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, isoforms containing 5\u2032 leaders over 1000 nucleotides long are poorly ribosome-associated relative to shorter 5\u2032 leaders (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and cluster 7, which is associated with few ribosomes, contains longer 5\u2032 leaders (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). It is likely that more subtle features of the 5\u2032 leader also influence translatability, as in the examples in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>."

We, therefore, counted the number of experimentally determined uORFs (<a href=\"#bib96\">Wan and Qian, 2014</a>) in each cluster and observe surprisingly complex behavior. Cognate uORFs (those starting with ATG) promote or repress translation, while noncognate uORFs generally promote translation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brar et al., 2012</a>). Along these lines, we find that cluster 1 (high polysomes) is enriched for cognate and noncognate uORFs while cluster 6 (low polysomes) is enriched for cognate uORFs. However, cluster 2 (high polysomes) is enriched for only noncognate uORFs, indicative of the complex and idiosyncratic behavior of uORFs. Taken together, we find predominant influences for the 3\u2032 UTR and the number of introns in determining polysome occupancy of gene-linked transcript isoforms in human cells, while a diversity of other features can influence translatability to a lesser extent."

We mapped transcripts expressed during each developmental stage onto the TrIP-seq clusters, to attempt to gain insight into global translational properties in human embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In embryos, our analysis predicts a shift towards the extremes of translation, with an increase in the percent of transcript isoforms that are both highly (e.g. clusters 1 and 2) and lowly (e.g. cluster 6) translated isoforms in HEK 293T cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Localized translation is widespread in development, and it is possible that the observed increase in poorly translated isoforms reflects a greater need for translational control (<a href=\"#bib8\">Besse and Ephrussi, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Jung et al., 2014</a>).

Clustering of abundances for 45,895 isoforms across embryogenesis yielded seven clusters with varying profiles, which we then analyzed by comparing transcripts of the same gene located in different embryonic clusters as before (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These isoforms were filtered by those that move between low- and high-polysome clusters in the TrIP-seq data, yielding 366 isoform pairs belonging to 270 genes that are developmentally regulated and exhibit differential translation in HEK 293T cells. For example, the <i>CSDE1</i> gene expresses one isoform in oocytes, early development and in human ES cells, which is poorly translated (CSDE1-002), but a second appears following fertilization that is well-translated (CSDE1-007; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). As global zygotic transcription begins in the two-cell stage (<a href=\"#bib92\">Vassena et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Yan et al., 2013</a>), it is possible that the alternative <i>CSDE1</i> isoform is supplied by the spermatid (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fischer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Soumillon et al., 2013</a>) or that it may be precociously transcribed. We also present three other genes (<i>EIF4A2, RNF170</i>, and <i>TBC1D15</i>) that show stage-specific expression in the embryo data and differential polysome association in HEK 293T cells (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, widespread changes at the transcriptome level during human embryogenesis may produce concomitant changes in protein production, which can now be predicted using TrIP-seq data."

In all cases, replacing the 3\u2032 UTRs leads to decreased protein production compared to the short 3\u2032 UTR in the control RNA. The paired 3\u2032 UTRs of <i>NAB1</i> and <i>RICTOR</i> each differ by two kilobases, and a factor of 35 and 44 in luciferase output, respectively, indicating that 3\u2032 UTRs can strongly modulate protein production (<a href=\"#bib5\">Mayr and Bartel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sandberg et al., 2008</a>). However, the two other paired 3\u2032 UTRs, despite also differing by two kilobases each, are not distinguishable at the protein production level in cells. The two tested <i>CCNE2</i> isoforms differ in both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs, so it is possible that the isoform-level translational control is occurring via the 5\u2032 UTR, and there is a small but not significant difference between the two <i>NDC1</i> 3\u2032 UTRs, suggesting regulation of this 3\u2032 UTR may be subtle. We also find a positive relationship between the average number of ribosomes on each transcript isoform in TrIP-seq and the luciferase fold change (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). In sum, we show that elements found to control translation at the isoform level using TrIP-seq can be grafted on to heterologous coding sequences to control translation over a range of two orders of magnitude in human cells."

Globally, we find that alternative 3\u2032 UTRs broadly influence translation, with longer isoforms of the same gene associated with lower protein production (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We further show that regulatory regions are sufficient to control the translation of unrelated coding sequences, enabling predictable tuning of translational output of arbitrary genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6B</a>). We demonstrate that translational control conferred by a panel of 5\u2032 leaders is more robust across cell types than 3\u2032 UTRs, suggesting predictable control of protein production. Future work focused on measuring isoform-specific translation in different cell types will yield cell\u00a0type-specific regulatory sequences, which could then be used to engineer cell\u00a0type-specific translation of mRNA, as in derivation of pluripotent stem cells (<a href=\"#bib99\">Warren et al., 2010</a>), or mRNA therapeutics (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kormann et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "Several observations indicate that TrIP-seq is a faithful measure of translation in cells. First, TrIP-seq and ribosome profiling are highly correlated at the gene level (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) and both ribosome profiling and TrIP-seq correlate with mass spectrometric measurements of protein abundance ([<a href=\"#bib37\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>], <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Second, protein-coding genes are enriched in high ribosomal fractions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), while lncRNAs are found primarily in the low ribosomal fractions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Third, a systematic investigation of translational stalling in mouse embryonic stem cells found this phenomenon to primarily be transient and not lead to ribosome accumulation on transcripts (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>), although in specific circumstances it can be more widespread (<a href=\"#bib16\">Darnell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ishimura et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib72\">Richter and Coller, 2015</a>). Fourth, known highly- and lowly-translated transcript isoforms are enriched in high- and low-polysome fractions in TrIP-seq data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Fifth, reads derived from stalled polysomes would artificially inflate the apparent translatability, however, TrIP-seq primarily underestimates rather than overestimates protein abundance (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Sixth, cryptic 'pseudo-polysomes' induced by miRNA complexes would preferentially enhance polysome association for long 3\u2032 UTR transcript isoforms (<a href=\"#bib55\">Maroney et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Nottrott et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Olsen and Ambros, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Thermann and Hentze, 2007</a>), which is the opposite of what is observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Lastly, transcript isoform changes found to lead to differential ribosome association using TrIP-seq are sufficient to modulate the protein output from a reporter RNA in a manner predicted by the TrIP-seq data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), indicating that transcript-specific ribosome association is a correlate of protein output. Therefore, we conclude that TrIP-seq is a measure of transcript-specific translation."

                        "text": "What are the mechanistic foundations of the observed transcript-specific translation? Each of the different untranslated regions tested by reporter assays operate using different mechanisms. For example, the three <i>EEF1B2</i> transcript isoforms all share the same uORF, but alternative splicing changes the distance between the uORF and the start codon, which can influence the efficiency of downstream initiation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Grant et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hinnebusch, 2005</a>). Globally, we found a large difference between the 3\u2032 UTR lengths of poorly- versus well-translated isoforms by querying the prevalence of features likely to influence translation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). There are at least three possibilities for how 3\u2032 UTRs could influence translation. First, miRNA-mediated regulation targets the 3\u2032 UTR (<a href=\"#bib5\">Mayr and Bartel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sandberg et al., 2008</a>). Second, numerous RNA binding proteins target the 3\u2032 UTR through AU-rich elements or other specific binding sites and are known to influence translation, mRNA decay and even protein localization (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berkovits and Mayr, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Szostak and Gebauer, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Zhao et al., 2014</a>). Lastly, it is possible that increasing the length of the 3\u2032 UTR influences the impact of the mRNA closed loop on translation initiation or reinitiation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amrani et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Costello et al., 2015</a>). Targeted work on specific 3\u2032 UTR isoform sets could test the different possibilities for 3\u2032 UTR-mediated translational control. We additionally demonstrated isoform-specific translational control for select 5\u2032 leaders (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>) as was shown genome-wide in yeast, where 5\u2032 leaders are short enough to directly sequence (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</a>), and find that globally uORFs can both up- and down-regulate translation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). However, we find a surprisingly minor global dependence of other 5\u2032 leader features tested on translation. The mechanisms of translational control of transcript isoforms therefore follow some general trends but are likely highly idiosyncratic; these data empower investigations into the mechanisms underlying transcript-specific translational control for thousands of human genes."

We show that even small changes to transcripts can dramatically affect protein production (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), so changes at the isoform level (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) can considerably affect protein abundances even if the gene-level RNA expression remains similar. The application of TrIP-seq to different cell types should yield cell\u00a0type-specific translation enhancer and repressor elements, contributing to the understanding of cell\u00a0type-specific translational control, and augmenting our ability to precisely engineer translation in complex systems. If simpler sample preparation is desired, it is likely sufficient to sequence the cytoplasmic and monosome fractions, as well as pooled two-four ribosome and five-eight+ ribosome fractions, as these cluster together (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Accumulation of TrIP-seq data in additional cell types may enable building a holistic model of translational control with isoform resolution in human cells."

These data can thus be used to select regulatory regions to control translation, without redesign of the coding sequence of the message (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). It may prove superior to use 3\u2032 UTRs to design cell\u00a0type specific translation, as the repertoire of miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins that may affect translation through the 3\u2032 UTR vary between cell types (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Indeed, in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, 3\u2032 UTRs are sufficient to specify germline-specific expression of the attached ORF (<a href=\"#bib61\">Merritt et al., 2008</a>). Even without engineering of unnatural mRNAs, it may be possible to use antisense oligonucleotides to direct splicing of poorly- or well-translated isoforms to adjust protein expression in situ (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kole et al., 2012</a>), for example to downregulate the oncogenic <i>NAE1</i> gene [<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#bib104\">Xie et al., 2014</a>]), which is currently being targeted by small molecules (<a href=\"#bib54\">Luo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Wu and Yu, 2015</a>). We anticipate the ability to tune the translational output of mRNA will facilitate research and therapeutic uses of designed and endogenous mRNA molecules."

In this regard, the TrIP-Seq approach as presented is basically identical to previous experimental designs (Sterne-Weiler et al. 2013; Maslon et al. 2014; Jingyi Hou et al. 2015). Nevertheless, the degree of novelty of the approach was not the key factor in the decision. Further, the reviewers were impressed with the reporter data (in the original cell type HEK293) that provided strong evidence for differential translation of isoforms, as suggested and then followed up from the initial observations from the global approach. The reporter data led to an interesting model where 5' UTR leader sequences contribute generally to overall translational efficiency. The authors further proposed a model wherein 3' UTRs would be generally more important in specifying cell-specific regulation, based on reporter analysis in several different cell types. However, the reviewers felt that these data did not provide sufficient breadth to justify the broad conclusions that were made and felt that further global analysis in different cell types would have provided this support. Overall, the reviewers concluded that this high quality analysis failed to sufficiently support the broad claims made concerning isoform-specific translation patterns but rather represented the beginnings of such an analysis. In the absence of broader exploration of this topic in multiple cell types (and a comparative analysis), the study falls short of its claims and thus is not appropriate for publication in <i>eLife</i>."

The work is well done and the experimental confirmation goes beyond previous works, however the \"TrIP-Seq\" approach is basically identical to previous experimental designs (Sterne-Weiler et al., 2013; Maslon et al., 2014; Jingyi Hou et al., 2015).

However that is clearly out of the scope of this first manuscript. To avoid misleading the readers, I would advise the authors to town down their claims and Discussion."

It is clear that their method measures polyribosome abundance, however the presented comparisons do not demonstrate that they measure translation. For example in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, neither TrIP-Seq nor ribosome profiling counts are corrected by mRNA abundance. Thus the observed correlation could be simple due to mRNA abundance (and not the translation efficiency). I would not expect their method to obtain a perfect correlation with ribosome protection or protein abundance, however it could be expected to be significantly greater than the one measured by mRNA abundance alone."

The authors claim that isoforms \"with more exons tend to be better translated\" and that that is not caused by transcript length. However in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and supplement, it can be observed that the length of the CDS could explain part of those differences. If that were the case, it would lead to the trivial observation that genes encoding longer proteins can potentially accommodate more ribosomes in their coding regions. That will cause those isoforms to be present in higher polyribosome fractions (independent of their translational potential). This effect would also potentially affect the clustering shown on <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, which would be affected both by the CDS length and the translation efficiency (polyribosome association)."

Indeed, this is the case either or both because there is too little data, data are wrong, or the right type of data have not been collected. I think this manuscript makes a great case for the last of these. I.e., prior work (arguably) has been too crude to ferret out or isolate different factors responsible. Here, having the gene the same but changing the 5' or 3' UTR is a much better controlled experiment to sort out these effects. I know that wasn't the authors' intention \u2013 they wanted to discover these effects \u2013 but serendipity has given them a great controlled experiment as well. My guess is that this is why they're able to get so much more information."

They then take nearly a page to note how 'ribo-seq' cannot do this. They then reveal that sucrose (polysome) gradients, followed by deep sequencing, can do this. But of course polysome fractionation is a very old technique. And it is not until the Results (paragraph one, subheading \u201cTrIP-seq measures transcript isoform-specific translation in human cells\u201d) that we learn that Arava et al. did polysome fractions for all yeast genes \u2013 at that time using microarrays. And microarrays could be designed to look at isoforms, or looked at another way, the technical extension of this work from the existing technologies is a modest step, but not presented in the appropriate historical context. While this is common, it is not needed. The biology and importance of the question stands for itself. So the authors\u2019 main advance is not a technique \u2013 but rather the identification of a (very) important question and unmet need, and the expert execution of addressing this question. (As a related aside, if one goes back to the original Ignolia et al. Science paper introducing ribo-seq, there the method has held \u2013 and been improved \u2013 and has been very important, but each of the scientific conclusions drawn was either made previously (by Arava et al.) or later shown to be incorrect. That paper still deserved the wide audience it got, as does this one, but let's work hard to get the intellectual and scholarly history right, whether or not it involves prior work that I was associated with.)"

Our work clearly shows that transcript isoforms of the same gene can be associated with different numbers of ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), which is driven by diverse sequence features of isoforms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), and that isoform-specific sequences that alter ribosome association by TrIP-seq can be used to control translation of orthogonal genes in a manner predicted by the sequencing data with a dynamic range of at least 100-fold (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Therefore, the data from HEK 293T cells present fundamental insights into transcript isoform specific translation in humans that remain unappreciated. These data and conclusions are new relative to previous work and are of interest to researchers in many fields including translation, splicing, transcription, and cancer biology, where the transcriptome is frequently altered. Furthermore, since we show that isoform-specific sequences can control translation of orthogonal genes in a predictable manner, researchers in mRNA therapeutics or synthetic biology can mine these data for sequences that confer graded translation responses in cells."

We have analyzed noncoding genes in high polysomes but did not include it in this manuscript version because we are still determining what it means. For example, clustering of transcripts derived from annotated noncoding genes reveals a similar heatmap to that for coding genes, with some transcripts strongly polysome associated (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1A</a>). Analysis of the gene types represented in high polysomes shows a two-fold enrichment for antisense transcripts (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1B</a>). We validated numerous individual examples of polysome-associated antisense transcripts by comparing to ribosome profiling datasets from HEK 293T cells from the Cho or Ingolia labs, for example the gene pair MCM3AP and MCM3AP-AS1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1C</a>). Therefore, one explanation for the abundance of noncoding genes in high polysome fractions is that a fraction of genes annotated as noncoding are translated. If this is interesting to the reviewers or editors we can include this analysis and more as a main text or supplemental figure."

There are examples of systematic stalling of elongating ribosomes, which would also decouple ribosome occupancy and translation (citations in the manuscript), but we reasoned here based on the literature that this is a minor effect because of e.g. no detectable long-term ribosome stalls in mouse ES cells (Ingolia 2011).

It is challenging to convert TrIP-seq abundances to quantitative protein synthesis rates due to the poor gradient resolution of mRNAs associated with many ribosomes in the poly8+ peak.
