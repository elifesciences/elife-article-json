We prospectively identified, and isolated by flow cytometry, adult mouse lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ) NICs as Glast<sup>mid</sup>EGFR<sup>high</sup>PlexinB2<sup>high</sup>CD24<sup>\u2212/low</sup>O4/PSA-NCAM<sup>\u2212/low</sup>Ter119/CD45<sup>\u2212</sup> (GEPCOT) cells. They were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo based on fate-mapping with <i>Ascl1</i><sup><i>CreERT2</i></sup> and <i>Dlx1</i><sup><i>CreERT2</i></sup>. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent, expressed higher Glast, and lower EGFR and PlexinB2. Pre-GEPCOT cells could not form neurospheres but expressed the stem cell markers <i>Slc1a3-CreER</i><sup><i>T</i></sup>, <i>GFAP-CreER</i><sup><i>T2</i></sup>, <i>Sox2</i><sup><i>CreERT2</i></sup>, and <i>Gli1</i><sup><i>CreERT2</i></sup> and were long-lived in vivo. While GEPCOT NICs were ablated by temozolomide, pre-GEPCOT cells survived and repopulated the SVZ. Conditional deletion of the <i>Bmi-1</i> polycomb protein depleted pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells, though pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent upon Bmi-1 for <i>Cdkn2a</i> (<i>p16</i><sup><i>Ink4a</i></sup>) repression. Our data distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo."

We prospectively identified, and isolated by flow cytometry, adult mouse lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ) NICs as Glast<sup>mid</sup>EGFR<sup>high</sup>PlexinB2<sup>high</sup>CD24<sup>\u2212/low</sup>O4/PSA-NCAM<sup>\u2212/low</sup>Ter119/CD45<sup>\u2212</sup> (GEPCOT) cells. They were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo based on fate-mapping with <i>Ascl1</i><sup><i>CreERT2</i></sup> and <i>Dlx1</i><sup><i>CreERT2</i></sup>. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent, expressed higher Glast, and lower EGFR and PlexinB2. Pre-GEPCOT cells could not form neurospheres but expressed the stem cell markers <i>Slc1a3-CreER</i><sup><i>T</i></sup>, <i>GFAP-CreER</i><sup><i>T2</i></sup>, <i>Sox2</i><sup><i>CreERT2</i></sup>, and <i>Gli1</i><sup><i>CreERT2</i></sup> and were long-lived in vivo. While GEPCOT NICs were ablated by temozolomide, pre-GEPCOT cells survived and repopulated the SVZ. Conditional deletion of the <i>Bmi-1</i> polycomb protein depleted pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells, though pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent upon Bmi-1 for <i>Cdkn2a</i> (<i>p16</i><sup><i>Ink4a</i></sup>) repression. Our data distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo."

When cells from the subventricular zone are cultured in a way that allows the cells to freely float around (rather than growing on a surface), a few percent form spherical colonies called neurospheres. Since neurosphere-forming cells can self-renew and differentiate into neurons and glia, the ability of cells to form neurospheres has generally been taken as evidence that they are stem cells. However, the exact relationship between neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells has been uncertain."

The neural stem cells, which Mich, Signer et al. term pre-GEPCOT cells (based on an acronym of the markers used to isolate the cells), were long-lived and quiescent, but they lacked the ability to form colonies in culture. The neurosphere-forming cells, named GEPCOT cells, were short-lived and highly proliferative in the brain. These results demonstrate that the cells that form neurospheres in culture are not stem cells at all, and that real stem cells are not able to form colonies under existing culture conditions."

First, the phenotype in <i>Bmi-1</i> germline knockout mice may indeed be more severe as non-cell-autonomous effects of <i>Bmi-1</i> deficient stroma contribute to stem cell deficits in these mice (<a href=\"#bib55\">Oguro et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2010</a>). Second, the death of <i>Bmi-1</i> germline knockout mice before young adulthood meant that adult phenotypes could not be studied directly and it was assumed that the deficits observed in the early postnatal period would rapidly worsen over time. Third, without the ability to prospectively identify qNSCs or NICs in vivo, these cells could only be studied based on neurosphere formation in culture. Since p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> and p19<sup>Arf</sup> expression are induced to a greater extent in culture than in vivo, the severity of <i>Bmi-1</i> deficiency phenotypes in the nervous system are sometimes exaggerated in culture (<a href=\"#bib48\">Molofsky et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">He et al., 2009</a>).

This is not a problem for embryonic or neonatal cell preparations. We compared multiple strategies to eliminate debris from adult SVZ preparations. The simplest, least expensive, and most reproducible solution was stringent forward scatter and side scatter gating as shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>. To use this technique it is important to calibrate the forward scatter and side scatter voltages using freshly isolated bone marrow cells because even a small change in PMT voltages can dramatically affect cell yield and the amount of debris contaminating the cellular fraction. Before every experiment we aligned the myeloid population into the center of the forward scatter/side scatter plot [FSC-Area = 125k, SSC-Area = 125k] then we ensured that the forward scatter threshold was set as high as possible without eliminating cells (typically 75000 and did not require daily adjustment). When the forward scatter and side scatter voltages are properly calibrated there should be a prominent population of adult SVZ cells with similar FSC/SSC as lymphoid cells."

Typically we keep each plate in a Ziploc bag filled with 6% CO<sub>2</sub>/93% N<sub>2</sub>/1% O<sub>2</sub> prior to the sort, then sort one plate in 2\u20133 min or less, and return it to a freshly gassed Ziploc bag until transferring the plate to a humidified 37\u00b0C, CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for culture. By keeping plates in 6% CO<sub>2</sub> before and after the sort, the culture medium does not equilibrate with the air (which would deplete CO<sub>2</sub> from the medium and increase pH to levels incompatible with cell survival)."

We also found that IGF1 (20 ng/ml) further improved clonogenesis after sorting. The mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear but may involve promotion of cell survival after sorting or repression of BMP signaling (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hsieh et al., 2004</a>). When using both these culture additives, there was little difference between sorted live SVZ cells and an equal number of cells added to culture by pipette in terms of the numbers of neurospheres they made."

First, we always sorted cells into culture at clonal (low) density: 1000 cells in 1.5 ml medium (0.66 cells/\u03bcl) in each well of a 6 well-plate. Second, we maintained a separate incubator specifically for neurosphere cultures that was only opened sparingly to prevent mechanical disturbances or changes in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations."

In the absence of CEE, sorted cell-derived primary neurospheres were few in number and very large, suggesting extensive sphere fusion. After adding 10% CEE to the culture medium, sorted cell-derived primary neurospheres were indistinguishable in size and number from neurospheres cultured from cells pipetted into culture. We found that the combination of 10% CEE plus 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 hydrochloride plus 20 ng/ml IGF1 maximized the formation of non-aggregating neurospheres from sorted adult SVZ cells."

Since TMZ treatment ablates GEPCOT NICs, any growth factor that enables colony formation by pre-GEPCOT cells should profoundly increase colony formation by SVZ cells from TMZ-treated mice. Out of the 36 growth factors and medium supplements we have tested so far, 5 significantly reduced colony-formation but none significantly increased colony formation.

However, given the lack of a clonal assay to detect quiescent neural stem cells we have no way to test purity. This means that to exclude non-stem cells from this population we will have to perform fate mapping with each potential non-stem cell marker. This will take a long time. Second, we should not expect quiescent neural stem cells to be rare. The idea that quiescent stem cells should be rare comes from the hematopoietic system, where stem cells are always rare and are always fated to form massive numbers of progeny. The nervous system has adopted a fundamentally different strategy in which stem cells (when they are present) are common, but are each fated to form relatively small numbers of progeny in vivo. Fate mapping of neural stem cells in multiple regions of the developing and adult nervous system has shown that undifferentiated neural stem cells undergo only a small number of divisions before terminally differentiating (e.g. PNAS 110: E1045; Cell Stem Cell 8: 566; Cell 145: 1142). Neural stem cells are commonly estimated to account for a few percent of the cells in germinal zones of the adult nervous system (e.g., Cell Stem Cell 11: 265; PNAS 106: 6387; J. Neurosci. 17: 5046)."
