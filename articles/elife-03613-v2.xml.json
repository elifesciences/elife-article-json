In this study, we describe a novel function of TAFs in directing genomic occupancy of a transcriptional activator. Using liver-specific inactivation in mice, we show that the TAF4 subunit of TFIID is required for post-natal hepatocyte maturation. TAF4 promotes pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation at post-natal expressed liver function genes and down-regulates a subset of embryonic expressed genes by increased RNA polymerase II pausing. The TAF4\u2013TAF12 heterodimer interacts directly with HNF4A and in vivo TAF4 is necessary to maintain HNF4A-directed embryonic gene expression at post-natal stages and promotes HNF4A occupancy of functional cis-regulatory elements adjacent to the transcription start sites of post-natal expressed genes. Stable HNF4A occupancy of these regulatory elements requires TAF4-dependent PIC formation highlighting that these are mutually dependent events. Local promoter-proximal HNF4A\u2013TFIID interactions therefore act as instructive signals for post-natal hepatocyte differentiation."

In this study, we describe a novel function of TAFs in directing genomic occupancy of a transcriptional activator. Using liver-specific inactivation in mice, we show that the TAF4 subunit of TFIID is required for post-natal hepatocyte maturation. TAF4 promotes pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation at post-natal expressed liver function genes and down-regulates a subset of embryonic expressed genes by increased RNA polymerase II pausing. The TAF4\u2013TAF12 heterodimer interacts directly with HNF4A and in vivo TAF4 is necessary to maintain HNF4A-directed embryonic gene expression at post-natal stages and promotes HNF4A occupancy of functional cis-regulatory elements adjacent to the transcription start sites of post-natal expressed genes. Stable HNF4A occupancy of these regulatory elements requires TAF4-dependent PIC formation highlighting that these are mutually dependent events. Local promoter-proximal HNF4A\u2013TFIID interactions therefore act as instructive signals for post-natal hepatocyte differentiation."

This causes severe hypoglycemia (that is, a drop in sugar levels in the blood). Moreover, it seems as if these cells start dying before they become fully mature. In liver cells lacking TAF4, some 1408 genes that are normally turned on just after birth are not properly switched on; these genes are necessary for the metabolic functions of the liver. Furthermore, 776 genes that are normally turned off after birth continue to be expressed. It seems that the absence of TAF4 sometimes disrupts the formation of the pre-initiation complex, which would slow down the production of RNA. However, it can also have the opposite effect by increasing the activity of RNA polymerase II, hence making too many copies of RNA from some genes."

The next stage in this work will be to explore if these mutations influence the interaction between HNF4A and TAF4, and if they do, whether these changes contribute to this form of diabetes."

The best understood are those of the cell-specific TAF paralogues like TAF7L that plays a critical role in male germ cell development and in adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cheng et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2014</a>) or TAF4B essential for male and female fertility (<a href=\"#bib13\">Falender et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Voronina et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, much less is known about the ubiquitously expressed \u2018core\u2019 TAFs. For example, mice carrying loss of function alleles for TAF10, TAF8, TAF7, or TBP die between blastocyst and pre-implantation stages upon depletion of the maternal protein (<a href=\"#bib43\">Voss et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Martianov et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mohan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gegonne et al., 2012</a>).

In contrast, in adult epidermis, loss of TAF10 has no evident phenotype whereas TAF4 plays a critical role in keratinocyte proliferation acting as a cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous tumour suppressor (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fadloun et al., 2007</a>)."

In this study, we show that TAF4 is essential for activation of the post-natal hepatocyte gene expression programme. The TAF4\u2013TAF12 heterodimer interacts with the nuclear receptor HNF4A to promote its binding to conserved and functional cis-regulatory elements located close to the transcription start sites of liver function genes. The stable binding of HNF4A to these elements is thus dependent on concomitant pre-initiation complex formation. These results reveal that HNF4A interaction with the basal transcription machinery controls not only PIC formation but also the occupation of its cognate regulatory elements."

In hepatocytes, the TAF3\u2013CTCF correlation was higher at the TSS (0.55) than at distal regions, the opposite of ES cells. A high TAF3\u2013H3K4me3 correlation was observed at distal sites suggesting that this may be a mechanism of recruitment to these sites. Nevertheless, H3K4me3 levels are low at many of these distal TAF3 sites and other recruitment mechanisms cannot be excluded. Comparison of TAF3 genomic occupancy in liver and ES cells identified common and specifically occupied sites at the TSS, reflecting different sets of active promoters in these two cell types. Moreover, many of the distal regions are also unique to each cell type (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

At the <i>Dio1</i> gene for example, two HNF4A binding sites were lost in the mutant, but a third was unchanged (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We therefore asked if the HNF4A sites depleted in the mutant correspond to functionally active sites. Comparison with public adult liver data showed that many depleted HNF4A sites associate with p300, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac, whereas less of the enriched HNF4A sites show this association (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Previous experiments identified evolutionary conserved HNF4A sites, suggesting they are critical for function (<a href=\"#bib35\">Schmidt et al., 2010</a>). A subset of HNF4A occupied sites is associated with binding sites for CEBPA, HNF6, and FOXA2 forming cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) many of which are conserved in at least two species (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ballester et al., 2014</a>). Other sites, designated here as \u2018singletons\u2019, correspond to HNF4A occupied sites that are not associated with binding sites for these other factors, although some are also conserved between at least two species. 60% of HNF4A sites depleted upon TAF4 inactivation overlap with CRMs, 16% of which are conserved (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). These CRMs display a higher proportion of sites for three or four factors and many associate with p300, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In contrast, only 20% of HNF4A sites enriched in the mutant overlap with CRMs of which only 4% are conserved and they show lesser association with active marks. Furthermore, CRMs depleted in the mutant, and in particular those associated with the 487 down-regulated genes, are strongly enriched at the TSS, whereas those with enhanced HNF4A occupancy appear more random although they are so few that there is no statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). This allowed us to define a set of 296 down-regulated genes where the depleted HNF4A sites are localised between \u00b110 kb relative to the TSS (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). ChIP-qPCR showed occupancy of CRMs at the <i>Dio1</i>, <i>Slc22a7</i>, and <i>Car5a</i> genes by FOXA2, HNF6, and CEBPA in WT liver, but not in the TAF4 mutant (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Conversely, at one of the rarer CRMs enriched in the mutant, ChIP-qPCR showed increased HNF4A, CEBPA, and HNF6 occupancy, while that of FOXA2 was not significantly modified. TAF4 is therefore required for occupancy of a set of functional CRMs located close to the TSS explaining the failure to activate HNF4A-regulated liver function genes in the TAF4 mutant."

The reduced HNF4A occupancy at E18.5 is not due to the lack of its expression that is comparable at E18.5 and adult stages (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The E18.5-occupied sites associate with &gt;1800 genes enriched in liver metabolic functions (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). While almost all E18.5-occupied sites were occupied at P12 and P75, subsets of sites show stronger occupation at P12 or P75 compared to other stages. We investigated the occupancy of sites enriched or depleted in the TAF4 mutant at the different developmental stages. A significant proportion of depleted sites maps to those with enriched occupancy at the neonatal stage (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). In contrast, around 30% of sites enriched in the mutant show only very low occupancy at other stages. Thus in the absence of TAF4, HNF4A occupies a set of sites the vast majority of which are not normally occupied either in embryonic or adult liver. This suggests that there may be a disorganisation of the chromatin landscape in the TAF4-mutant liver that allows HNF4A accessibility to sites that are not accessible in wild type. TAF4 is therefore necessary to promote normal HNF4A genomic occupancy, in particular of promoter-associated functional CRMs."

Diminished TBP recruitment in TAF4 mutant liver may by itself not explain the loss of PIC formation and HNF4A occupancy of the functional TSS-proximal CRMs. We therefore asked whether HNF4A also interacts with TAF4, as loss of this interaction would better explain the observed phenotype. HEK cells were transfected with vectors expressing combinations of HNF4A, full-length mouse, or human TAF4 in the presence or absence of TAF12 and the extracts precipitated with anti-HNF4A antibodies.

We also show a correlation between HNF4A, TBP/TFIID, and PIC occupancy at distal sites, possibly enhancers, indicative of functional HNF4A\u2013TFIID interactions in vivo. While this may in part be accounted for by interaction of the HNF4A-DBD with TBP (<a href=\"#bib38\">Takahashi et al., 2009</a>), we show that HNF4A also interacts with the TAF4\u2013TAF12 heterodimer via its LBD. HNF4A directly forms a complex with the histone fold-containing regions of TAF4\u2013TAF12 when co-expressed in bacteria. In the absence of TAF4, HNF4A occupancy of TSS-proximal CRMs and/or PIC formation are compromised strongly suggesting that two direct HNF4A\u2013TFIID interactions via the TAF4\u2013TAF12 heterodimer and TBP are required to activate liver function genes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). An analogous mechanism has been described where TAF4 acts as a cofactor for E-proteins (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). E-proteins interact with the TAFH domain of TAF4 as opposed to the histone-fold region for HNF4A, and this interaction enhances TFIID binding to the core promoter. Our data are consistent with a model where stable binding of HNF4A to TSS proximal CRMs and PIC formation require HNF4A\u2013TFIID interactions. The concomitant loss of PIC formation and CRM occupancy upon TAF4 inactivation indicates that they are mutually dependent events."

A similar conclusion was drawn when TAF10 that is also essential for TFIID integrity was inactivated in adult liver (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tatarakis et al., 2008</a>). TAF10 inactivation occurred later than TAF4 in this study and despite TFIID disassembly, a milder phenotype is observed as <i>Taf10</i><sup>hep\u2212/\u2212</sup> animals die at P35\u2013P38. Upon TAF10 inactivation, recruitment of TBP and TAFs to many promoters is lost but PIC formation was not affected suggesting that transcription persists in the absence of TBP/TFIID. In contrast, we show that TBP (and TAF1, unpublished data) is recruited to promoters of expressed genes, and its recruitment and PIC formation are diminished to comparable extents. Moreover, TAF3 promoter occupancy at expressed genes is less affected. While loss of TFIID integrity compromises TBP occupancy and PIC formation, interaction with H3K4me3 acts to stabilise TAF3 recruitment independently of TBP. We therefore find no evidence for PIC formation and gene expression in the absence of TBP and TAF3 recruitment in the TAF4 mutant hepatocytes."

Also it has been previously described that TAF7 has a negative effect on CDK9 and BRD4 activity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Devaiah et al., 2010</a>). Perhaps defective recruitment of TAF7 at these genes due to compromised TFIID integrity would explain the augmented CDK9 recruitment and an increase in its kinase activity would account for the enhanced elongation. Nevertheless, our observations show that down-regulation of many of these genes normally occurs at least initially through increased Pol II-pausing at post-natal stages, while in the absence of TAF4 they continue to be expressed with higher levels of elongating Pol II as in their embryonic mode. We also observed diminished paused Pol II at a small subgroup of highly expressed liver identity genes that may be under the control of \u2018super enhancers\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Whyte et al., 2013</a>), where TAF3 and H3K4me3 levels were also reduced. This concomitant reduction suggests that TAF3/H3K4me3 levels may modulate Pol II pausing at this class of genes."

Previous models proposed that activators bind their cognate sites and promote PIC formation via interactions with TAFs. We show in vivo that HNF4A stably occupies a set of functional sites only when accompanied by concomitant TAF4-dependent PIC formation showing that these are mutually dependent events (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Many recent studies have highlighted the role of long-range enhancer\u2013promoter interactions and the formation of large-scale chromatin domains (<a href=\"#bib9\">de Laat and Duboule, 2013</a>). In contrast, we highlight here the importance of local interactions at the TSS. Although HNF4A is also present at distal enhancers, functional HNF4A sites cluster close to the TSS and interactions with TFIID and also possibly the mediator complex (<a href=\"#bib27\">Malik et al., 2002</a>) play a critical role in gene activation."

By using a liver-specific TAF4 mutant mouse line, the authors observed several severe liver failures in P12 to P21 mice that led to lethality. RNA-seq analysis suggest that a subset of liver functional genes are deregulated in TAF4 mutant mice. Using genome-wide ChIP-seq assays, the authors further show that TAF4 inactivation diminishes PIC formation and attenuates HNF4a occupancy on a subset of post-natally expressed genes in liver. Finally, in a biochemical analysis the authors show a direct interaction between HNF4a and the TAF4/TAF12 dimer that may explain the impaired HNF4a occupancy of its targets in TAF4 mutant mice."

Indeed, as the referees point out the defective TFIID assembly in the mutant suggests that interactions with TBP may contribute to, but are not sufficient for HNF4A recruitment and PIC assembly and that multiple interactions with TFIID through TBP and the associated TAF4-TAF12 are necessary.

Perhaps defective recruitment of TAF7 at these genes due to compromised TFIID integrity would explain the augmented CDK9 recruitment and an increase in its kinase activity would account for the enhanced elongation. We did not discuss this as we have no ChIP-grade TAF7 antibody that allows us to test the idea. Also enhanced elongation is not a general effect, but is limited to a sub-set of genes. We originally investigated whether these promoters had some common feature (TATA+, or TATA-less for example), but so far we have not identified any common feature of this subset of promoters.
