Using measurements of capillary erythrocyte-associated transients, fluctuations of oxygen partial pressure (Po<sub>2</sub>) associated with individual erythrocytes, to infer Po<sub>2</sub> in the nearby neuropil, we report the first non-invasive micron-scale mapping of cerebral Po<sub>2</sub> in awake, resting mice. Interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> has similar values in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer and the somatosensory cortex, whereas there are large capillary hematocrit and erythrocyte flux differences. Awake tissue Po<sub>2</sub> is about half that under isoflurane anesthesia, and within the cortex, vascular and interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> values display layer-specific differences which dramatically contrast with those recorded under anesthesia. Our findings emphasize the importance of measuring energy parameters non-invasively in physiological conditions to precisely quantify and model brain metabolism."
