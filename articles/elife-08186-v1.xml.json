While both \u03b4 <sup>13</sup>C results were in the normal range of \u221220 to \u221224\u2030, a small enrichment was observed at \u221222.7 \u00b1 0.1 and \u221221.2 \u00b1 0.7\u2030 for unlabeled and labeled solvents, respectively.

Copper (II) oxide and silver wire that were previously pre-baked in oxygen were then added to the tubes, which were subsequently flame sealed. Lipids were then combusted in sealed tubes at 900\u00b0C overnight. CO<sub>2</sub> was collected from the breakseals and dried by passing through a cryotrap (\u221278\u00b0C). The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> was determined and transferred into the small volume graphitization apparatus for graphite target production. <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C isotopic ratios were measured on the Small Tandem for Applied Research (STAR) accelerator, which has greater than 0.5% precision for samples above 50 \u03bcg. Typical sample sizes were in the range of 70\u2013120 \u03bcg of carbon. As the small weight of each sample made them susceptible to contamination, blanks that were subjected to the same procedural steps as the lens samples (including extraction steps) were processed with each batch of samples. Blanks produced a residual solvent carbon mass of 10\u201320 \u03bcg following evaporation and were measured for radiocarbon on the Australian National Tandem for Applied Research (ANTARES) accelerator (Fink et al., 2004), which provides greater accuracy for samples less than 50 \u03bcg carbon."
