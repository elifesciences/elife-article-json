In a search for components that participate in building the elaborate architecture of this complex organelle we have identified Aim24, an inner membrane protein. Aim24 interacts with the MICOS complex that is required for the formation of crista junctions and contact sites between inner and outer membranes. Aim24 is necessary for the integrity of the MICOS complex, for normal respiratory growth and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Modification of MICOS subunits Mic12 or Mic26 by His-tags in the absence of Aim24 leads to complete loss of cristae and respiratory complexes. In addition, the level of tafazzin, a cardiolipin transacylase, is drastically reduced and the composition of cardiolipin is modified like in mutants lacking tafazzin. In conclusion, Aim24 by interacting with the MICOS complex plays a key role in mitochondrial architecture, composition and function."

In a search for components that participate in building the elaborate architecture of this complex organelle we have identified Aim24, an inner membrane protein. Aim24 interacts with the MICOS complex that is required for the formation of crista junctions and contact sites between inner and outer membranes. Aim24 is necessary for the integrity of the MICOS complex, for normal respiratory growth and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Modification of MICOS subunits Mic12 or Mic26 by His-tags in the absence of Aim24 leads to complete loss of cristae and respiratory complexes. In addition, the level of tafazzin, a cardiolipin transacylase, is drastically reduced and the composition of cardiolipin is modified like in mutants lacking tafazzin. In conclusion, Aim24 by interacting with the MICOS complex plays a key role in mitochondrial architecture, composition and function."

These subunits apparently introduce positive curvature into the dimers and oligomers of the F<sub><b>1</b></sub>F<sub><b>O</b></sub>-ATP synthase and thereby into the membrane which then leads to the formation of crista rims (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dudkina et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Strauss et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Rabl et al., 2009</a>). Mitofilin is another protein whose architectural role was recognized early on. It is required for the formation of crista junctions (<a href=\"#bib32\">John et al., 2005</a>). Later, it was proved to be a component of a larger complex, the MICOS/MINOS/Mitos complex (<a href=\"#bib25\">Harner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</a>). An agreement between researchers in this field was recently reached to introduce a uniform nomenclature (<a href=\"#bib50a\">Pfanner et al., 2014</a>). The MICOS/MINOS/Mitos complex is now called MICOS (\u2018mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system\u2019). MICOS is composed of at least six subunits whose names are now (former names in brackets): Mic60 (Fcj1), Mic10 (Mcs10/Mos1/Mio10), Mic12 (Mcs12/Aim5), Mic19 (Mcs19/Aim13), Mic26 (Mcs29/Mos2, Mio27) and Mic27 (Mcs27/Aim37).

An artificial protein spanning both the outer and inner membrane was introduced that functions as a marker for sites of adhesion. Vesicles were generated by sonic fragmentation of mitochondria and separated by buoyant density centrifugation. We used high resolution mass spectrometry to determine the distribution profiles of proteins across the gradient. In this way, the MICOS complex was identified. In addition, we identified other proteins that meet the criterion of a protein present at contact sites between outer and inner membranes, among them Aim24. Like several subunits of the MICOS complex, Aim24 belongs to a larger group of proteins identified in a screen for altered inheritance of mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hess et al., 2009</a>). Here we report an analysis of the role of Aim24 in mitochondrial architecture, function and dynamics. Although Aim24 could not be co-isolated with the MICOS complex, our results suggest that Aim24 plays a central role in the modulation of the MICOS complex and in the control of mitochondrial architecture, morphology as well as protein and lipid composition."

The MS/MS data identified it as the product of the gene <i>AIM24</i> (systematic name <i>YJR080C</i>). This gene had previously been found in a screen for mutants with altered inheritance of mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hess et al., 2009</a>). It encodes a 391 amino acid protein (44.4 kDa) with unknown function. It was localized to mitochondria in the MitoGFP database (<a href=\"#bib31\">Huh et al., 2003</a>) and in a proteomics screen for identification of mitochondrial proteins (<a href=\"#bib52\">Reinders et al., 2006</a>). The presence of an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal is predicted by the deduced amino acid sequence. To confirm presequence-dependent targeting we analyzed the sizes of wild type Aim24, N-terminally His-tagged Aim24 (inserted after the initial methionine) and C-terminally His-tagged Aim24. In isolated mitochondria N-terminally His-tagged Aim24 showed the same apparent size as wild type Aim24 indicating cleavage of the targeting sequence. In contrast, C-terminally His-tagged Aim24 was slightly larger as it contained the C-terminal His-tag (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The processing of the N-terminus of Aim24 strongly suggests import via the TOM-TIM23 pathway and the location of the mature protein in the matrix space or inner membrane. In order to analyse the location of the C-terminus, we treated mitochondria and mitoplasts containing a version of Aim24 carrying a C-terminal HA-tag with proteinase K. Removal of the HA-tag was not observed, suggesting also the presence of the C-terminus in the matrix or in the membrane. Aim24 could only be degraded by proteinase K (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>) and several other proteases (not shown) when mitochondria were lysed with Triton X-100."

The protein was found to be resistant against alkaline extraction. This observation was rather surprising, since the sequence of Aim24 does not contain a predicted transmembrane segment, although a segment lacking charged residues (residues 200\u2013213) is present. To investigate whether Aim24 is anchored in the inner membrane by this segment, we introduced two charged residues (G207R, G208E); according to computational analysis this strongly reduces the hydrophobicity. This mutation did not interfere with targeting of the protein to mitochondria in vivo nor did it alter its lack of extractability by alkaline solutions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Moreover, after alkaline treatment of mitochondria, the mutated Aim24 remained in the membrane and was not present as an aggregate as shown by membrane flotation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Interestingly, in homologs of Aim24 of other species, for example <i>Kluyveromyces lactis</i> and <i>Candida glabrata</i>, the uncharged segment corresponding to residues 200\u2013213 of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Aim24 was even shorter with 12 and 9 residues, respectively.

In contrast, Aim24 was still present in a complex of the same apparent molecular mass as in wild type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>).

Strikingly, with mitochondria from \u0394<i>aim24</i> cells the majority of Mic10 was found as a ca.300 kDa complex, whereas only a small fraction was present in the 1.5 MDa complex upon gel filtration. The subunits Mic60, Mic27 and the majority of Mic26 were still recovered in the 1.5 MDa complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This suggests that absence of Aim24 either leads to loss of Mic10 from MICOS, or Mic10 remains with MICOS but is destabilized and Mic10 dissociates upon solubilisation with digitonin. Notably, the expression of C-terminally His-tagged or HA-tagged forms of Aim24 had the same effect on the integrity of the MICOS complex as deletion of the <i>AIM24</i> gene; it led to almost complete dissociation of Mic10 upon solublisation of mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The MICOS complex may undergo only minor conformational changes due to the minor alterations generated by Aim24 modified by a small C-terminal tag. Therefore, the behavior of Mic10 in \u0394<i>aim24</i> and Aim24-HA cells appears to represent a destabilization of the MICOS complex. Localization of Mic10 in \u0394<i>aim24</i> cells by immuno EM analysis is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>. About 93% of all gold particles were located at the IBM, of which 51% at crista junctions. A parallel analysis of wild type mitochondria yielded 95% at the IBM and 62% of these at crista junctions. This does not prove, but is consistent with a continued but weaker association of Mic10 with the MICOS subunits. In conclusion, these results suggest that functional Aim24 is required for the integrity of Mic10 into the MICOS complex."

In cells in which the <i>AIM24</i> gene was deleted, the expression of MICOS subunits was altered. The levels of Mic10, Mic12, Mic27 and Mic26 were increased whereas that of Mic60 was not altered (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). In contrast, deletion of Mic60 and Mic10 led to down-regulation of the other MICOS subunits. The level of Aim24 in cells lacking Mic60 was unchanged and slightly decreased in cells lacking Mic10. In comparison, the levels of several OM and IM membrane proteins, ATP4, Su e, F1\u03b2, Tim50 and Tom40, were not altered (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). In view of the increased level of Mic10 in \u0394<i>aim24</i> mitochondria, a fraction of Mic10 in the 300 kDa complex could represent unassembled species rather than protein dissociate upon gel filtration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We quantified the amount of Mic10 present in wild type and \u0394<i>aim24</i> in the 1.5 MDa (fractions 2\u20135) and the 300 kDa complex (fractions 16\u201319) in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D</a>. If the amounts of Mic10 present in the 1.5 MDa fractions in wild type and \u0394<i>aim24</i> are normalized to a ratio of 1, the ratio in the 300 kDa fractions amounts to 5.0. This excludes the possibility that the presence of Mic10 in the 300 kDa fraction was due or solely due to an unassembled form of Mic10. Notably, other MICOS subunits with similar increased levels in \u0394<i>aim24</i> mitochondria were not present as unassembled species. Finally, we quantified the expression levels of MICOS subunits in Aim24-HA expressing cells. Here, the levels of Mic10 and the other MICOS subunits were not altered as compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). However, with these mitochondria Mic10 was observed virtually completely in the 300 kDa fraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This observation strongly supports the notion that the modification of Aim24 by the HA-tag, like the deletion of Aim24, leads to a destabilization of the MICOS complex. In sum, these findings demonstrate the importance of Aim24 for maintaining the integrity of the MICOS complex."

Association was analyzed by co-isolation assays, using digitonin lysed mitochondria containing a His-tagged version of Mic10. While Mic12, Mic19, Mic27, Mic26 and Mic60 could be co-isolated with Mic10, no specific binding of Aim24 was detected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, left). However, when mitochondria were solubilized with Triton X-100, which leads to dissociation of the MICOS complex into smaller complexes, efficient co-isolation of Aim24 with Mic10 was observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, right). This shows that both proteins can specifically interact depending on the state of the MICOS complex. Furthermore, the precise co-fractionation with the MICOS subunits upon fragmentation of mitochondria into small vesicles derived from contact sites is consistent with an association of Aim24 with the MICOS complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Thus, Aim24 is likely to be weakly or transiently associated with the MICOS complex at mitochondrial contact sites, and Mic10 appears to be involved in this interaction. It should be noted in this context that the MICOS complex itself has a high propensity to fall apart upon solubilisation even with very mild detergents."

This was surprising since cells containing these His-tagged proteins in the presence of Aim24 displayed no impairment of growth. The combination of two other His-tagged MICOS subunits, Mic19-His6 or Mic27-His6, with \u0394<i>aim24</i> deletion did not result in a synthetic lethal phenotype on non-fermentable carbon source (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). To relate this to the assembly state of the MICOS complex, we analyzed the His-tagged strains which lacked Aim24 by size exclusion chromatography. In the strains containing Mic12-His6 and Mic26-His6 the MICOS complex was further destabilized, whereas in the strains containing Mic19-His6 and Mic27-His6 the MICOS complex behaved like in the \u0394<i>aim24</i> mutant containing the wild type forms of the Mic proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

This was not due to the loss of the mitochondrial genome as all strains still contained mtDNA as checked by staining with DAPI (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). To investigate this phenotype in more detail, we performed Blue native gel electrophoresis to analyse respiratory complexes in isolated mitochondria. Because of the inability of cells harboring His-tagged Mic12 or Mic26 in the \u0394<i>aim24</i> deletion background to grow on non-fermentable carbon source all strains were grown by adding glucose to lactate containing growth medium. The mitochondria isolated from these cells displayed a drastic reduction or complete absence of the respiratory supercomplexes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). There was also a strong reduction of the steady state levels of individual respiratory chain subunits and an almost complete deficiency in subunit e (Su e) of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase. Furthermore, the individual MICOS subunits were down-regulated as well when Mic12 or Mic26 were His-tagged in the \u0394<i>aim24</i> deletion background (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

                                "text": "We reasoned that compromised mitochondrial function in \u0394<i>aim24</i> mutants could be related to an alteration in the homeostasis of mitochondrial membrane lipids. Membrane lipids of mitochondria isolated from \u0394<i>aim24</i> cells and \u0394<i>aim24</i> cells carrying His-tagged MICOS subunits were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mitochondria from wild type, \u0394<i>aim24</i> as well as \u0394<i>aim24</i> cells in combination with His-tagged Mic19 or Mic27 did not show a significant difference in the distribution of membrane phospholipids and ergosterol (not shown). In contrast, mitochondria from cells lacking Aim24 and harboring His-tagged Mic12 or Mic26 contained slightly increased levels of ergosterol and, conspicuously, the pattern of acyl chains specifically of cardiolipin was significantly altered (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). There was a shift towards longer and more saturated acyl chains. Since the enzyme responsible for mediating exchange of acyl chains on cardiolipin was identified as tafazzin (Taz1) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schlame, 2013</a>), we checked whether deletion of Aim24 would affect this protein. Mitochondria from wild type and \u0394<i>aim24</i> cells as well as \u0394<i>aim24</i> cells carrying His-tagged versions of Mic12, Mic19, Mic27 and Mic26 were analyzed. Notably, the steady state levels of Taz1 were drastically reduced in \u0394<i>aim24</i> cells expressing Mic12-His6 or Mic26-His6, but not in \u0394<i>aim24</i> cells expressing Mic19-His6 or Mic27-His6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Furthermore, cells in which the subunits Mic60 and Mic10 of the MICOS complex were deleted showed wild type levels of Taz1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Thus, loss of Taz1 is not simply a consequence of the destabilization of the MICOS complex or the loss of crista junctions. These data link together the observed deficiency in respiratory supercomplexes with the function of tafazzin and suggest that the steady state level of tafazzin is coupled to the state of the MICOS complex. Tafazzin was reported to be anchored to the inner face of the outer membrane. Upon gradient fractionation of mitochondrial membrane vesicles it was also found in inner membrane fractions as well as in fractions containing both outer and inner membranes, presumably representing contacts between both membranes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ma et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brandner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Claypool et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herndon et al., 2013</a>). In summary, the MICOS complex and Aim24 may not be directly involved in membrane phospholipid metabolism, but spatially control the process of mitochondrial protein composition which in turn leads to specific changes of the lipid composition."

Initially detected in a screen for altered inheritance of mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hess et al., 2009</a>), we found Aim24 in a search for proteins that are present in crista junctions and associated with contact sites that link outer and inner boundary membranes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Harner et al., 2011</a>). We report here that Aim24 has a distinct function in stabilizing/modulating the MICOS complex which is relevant in a number of aspects such as protein and lipid composition, architecture and metabolic function of mitochondria. Aim24 is firmly associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This was unexpected in view of the overall hydrophilic nature of the protein and the absence of a predicted transmembrane segment. Computational structure prediction of Aim24 indicates that it belongs to the family of TRAP-like proteins. A hallmark of this family is that its members are composed of antiparallel \u03b2-sheets (<a href=\"#bib6\">Antson et al., 1995</a>). So far no protein with a domain consisting of \u03b2-sheets has been described to exist in the inner membrane of mitochondria; however, it cannot be excluded that Aim24 is embedded in the lipid environment by this structural element. This would explain the firm association with the inner membrane. At the same time, this might explain the existence of Aim24 as a large complex of ca. 400 kDa as the members of the TRAP-like protein family were reported to form oligomers."

In the absence of functional Aim24, the MICOS complex is destabilized as demonstrated by the dissociation of Mic10 upon detergent solubilisation of mitochondria. Interestingly, a physical interaction of Aim24 with subunits of the wild type MICOS complex was not observed after lysis of mitochondria with digitonin. However, when the MICOS complex was dissociated by Triton X-100, Aim24 was found to be completely associated with Mic10. In the intact mitochondria Aim24 is apparently associated with the MICOS complex, in consistence with its topology indicated by our quantitative proteomics screen (<a href=\"#bib25\">Harner et al., 2011</a>). This interaction is obviously highly sensitive to minor disturbances, such as lysis of mitochondrial membranes even with mild detergents and the presence of C-terminal tags on certain MICOS subunits. The interaction is also reflected in the strong alteration of the expression levels of the MICOS subunits in cells deficient in Aim24, most of them being up-regulated. Thus, Aim24 is likely to regulate the association of Mic10 with other subunits of the complex. One would, however, not exclude the possibility that Aim24 exerts its function also as an assembly factor of the MICOS complex."

In agreement with the reported alteration of inheritance of mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hess et al., 2009</a>), Aim24 deficient cells are restricted in their growth on non-fermentable carbon source. Interestingly, combination of deletion of Aim24 with the expression of each of the two MICOS subunits Mic12 or Mic26 as C-terminally His-tagged variants leads to synthetic lethality on non-fermentable carbon sources. This points to a functional interaction of these genes as the single deletion mutants are either not at all or only mildly affected (<a href=\"#bib25\">Harner et al., 2011</a>). This supports the conclusion that Aim24 has a very important role in controlling the function of the MICOS complex."

This is not only suggested by its interaction with the MICOS complex, but also by prominent phenotypical traits that become apparent upon deletion or modification of Aim24. First, the percentage of mitochondria with septae is strongly increased, as seen in cells grown on fermentable and non-fermentable carbon source. And second, giant distorted mitochondria accumulate with irregular inner membranes. In particular the formation of inner membrane septae indicates a role of Aim24 in the shaping of crista junctions. These are usually narrow ring- or slot-like structures (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mannella et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Rabl et al., 2009</a>). Their extension leads to structures which in sections show double membranes crossing the matrix completely, and which appear as septae. Notably, the width of the junctions of cristae and septae at the inner boundary membrane were like in wild type, whereas their lateral extension was strongly increased. The formation of giant mitochondria is apparent both in fluorescent and electron microscopic images. These mitochondria show a dramatically altered structure of their inner membrane. We consider it likely that they represent later stages of inner membrane deterioration concomitant with accumulation of inner membrane defects."

Introducing one of these altered subunits into \u0394<i>aim24</i> cells leads to the absence of the large and giant mitochondria typical of \u0394<i>aim24</i> cells and presence of particularly small mitochondria, entirely lacking cristae and instead containing septae. This is accompanied by the loss of complexes and components of oxidative phosphorylation and the inviability under respiratory conditions. Although the over all levels of cardiolipin and of other membrane phospholipids is not altered in these latter mutants, the difference in the pattern of acyl chains in cardiolipin is remarkable. The massive reduction of respiratory complexes whose function is dependent on cardiolipin indicates a connection between Aim24, cardiolipin and the function of the MICOS complex. Surprisingly, the alteration in the types of acyl residues observed were characteristic of those described for mutants with deficiencies in tafazzin in different organisms (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vreken et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Schlame et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gu et al., 2004</a>). Deficiency in tafazzin underlies the Barth syndrome, a severe X-chromosome-linked disorder characterized by cardiac and skeletal myopathy and neutropenia (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barth et al., 1983</a>). In mitochondria of patient cells the fraction of cardiolipin with tetralinoleoyl groups is largely diminished. Furthermore, alterations of the structure of cristae and partial deficiency of respiratory complexes were observed in humans and also in several different organisms including yeast (<a href=\"#bib33\">Joshi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Acehan et al., 2011</a>). Tafazzin is a cardiolipin transacylase (<a href=\"#bib69\">Xu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Schlame, 2013</a>). It was suggested to be recruited to non-bilayer type lipid domains that occur in curved membrane areas sensing non-bilayer arrangement of membrane lipids (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schlame et al., 2012</a>). Mitochondrial cristae junctions and contact sites, structured by the MICOS complex correspond exactly to such proposed areas. Interestingly, the human homolog of Mic26, APOOL, has recently been shown to have the ability to bind cardiolipin (<a href=\"#bib65\">Weber et al., 2013</a>)."

Surprisingly, beside the drastic changes in mitochondrial architecture, there is a practically complete loss of respiratory complexes. This phenotype is much more severe than that reported for tafazzin deficiency, but can be explained by the complete loss of cristae in these mutant cells. Putting all the available information together we propose that the localization of tafazzin in the outer membrane provides it with the ability to reach the inner membrane specifically at contact sites and crista junctions. On the one hand, this would explain the partial co-localization with inner membrane fractions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Claypool et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herndon et al., 2013</a>). On the other hand in this way tafazzin could become enzymatically active directly at crista junctions, membrane sites showing extreme curvature where cardiolipin modified by tafazzin is specifically needed (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schlame et al., 2012</a>). Such a mechanism may be relevant also in regard to the important question raised previously, why and how only a specific limited fraction of cardiolipin is modified by tafazzin (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schlame, 2013</a>). In conclusion, Aim24 appears to have an important role in determining mitochondrial architecture by affecting not only assembly of the MICOS complex, but also by organizing complex reactions such as the remodelling of cardiolipin which makes it competent for the formation of respiratory supercomplexes and the architecture of cristae."

The organic phase was evaporated and dried lipids were dissolved in 50 \u00b5l 10 mM ammonium acetate in methanol. Aliquots were diluted 1:2 with 0.1% piperidine in methanol. Mass spectrometric analysis of CL species was performed in negative ion mode on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QStar Elite, AB Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany). Direct infusion was performed via an automated Chip-based system (Triversa Nanomate, Advion Biosciences, Harlow, United Kingdom). Ionization voltage was set to \u22120.95 kV, gas pressure to 0.5 psi. CLs were detected as [M-H]<sup>\u2212</sup> molecules. CL species (all combinations of fatty acids 16:0, 16:1, 16:2, 18:0, 18:1 and 18:2) were analyzed by targeted product ion scanning. Data processing was performed as described (<a href=\"#bib45\">Osman et al., 2009</a>)."

Before answering their comments, we report that very recently the community working on the MICOS complex has reached an agreement on a uniform nomenclature of the MICOS complex and the genes and proteins of its subunits. This agreement, signed by 26 authors, has been submitted as a Comment to The Journal of Cell Biology and is expected to be published shortly. We are now using this nomenclature in our revised manuscript."

We have also quantified the distribution of Mcs10 in the 1.5 MDa and 300k Da fractions of gel filtration of wild type, the Aim24 deletion strain and the Aim24-3HA strain. Taking into account the increase of Mcs10 in the Aim24 deletion strain, it is clear that the increase of Mcs10 in the 300 kDa fraction cannot be the result of the increase of Mcs10 in whole mitochondria. If Mcs10 was present as an unassembled, supernumerary subunit, the subunits Mcs12, Mcs19, Mcs27 and Mcs29 which are increased like Mcs10 would be expected to be present as supernumerary species. This is not the case. Moreover, in the Aim24-3HA strain Mcs10 is not increased, but Mcs10 is completely dissociated upon gel filtration. This strongly supports the notion that indeed the deletion of Aim24, like the His-tagging of Aim24 alters the interaction of Mcs10 with the other MICOS subunits and affects the integrity of MICOS."
