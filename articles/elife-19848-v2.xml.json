This continuous model is based upon <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution and <i>in vivo</i> ensemble experiments. Here, we characterize the replisome-complex stoichiometry and dynamics with single-molecule resolution in bacterial cells. Strikingly, the stoichiometries of the replicative helicase, DNA polymerase, and clamp loader complexes are consistent with the presence of only one active replisome in a significant fraction of cells (&gt;40%). Furthermore, many of the observed complexes have short lifetimes (&lt;8 min), suggesting that replisome disassembly is quite prevalent, possibly occurring several times per cell cycle. The instability of the replisome complex is conflict-induced: transcription inhibition stabilizes these complexes, restoring the second replisome in many of the cells. Our results suggest that, in contrast to the canonical model, DNA replication is a largely discontinuous process <i>in vivo</i> due to pervasive replication-transcription conflicts."

This continuous model is based upon <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution and <i>in vivo</i> ensemble experiments. Here, we characterize the replisome-complex stoichiometry and dynamics with single-molecule resolution in bacterial cells. Strikingly, the stoichiometries of the replicative helicase, DNA polymerase, and clamp loader complexes are consistent with the presence of only one active replisome in a significant fraction of cells (&gt;40%). Furthermore, many of the observed complexes have short lifetimes (&lt;8 min), suggesting that replisome disassembly is quite prevalent, possibly occurring several times per cell cycle. The instability of the replisome complex is conflict-induced: transcription inhibition stabilizes these complexes, restoring the second replisome in many of the cells. Our results suggest that, in contrast to the canonical model, DNA replication is a largely discontinuous process <i>in vivo</i> due to pervasive replication-transcription conflicts."

                        "text": "The rapid and faithful replication of the genome is essential to cell proliferation. Although the replisome, the cellular machinery responsible for DNA replication, has been extensively studied both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Donnell et al., 2013</a>), fundamental questions remain about the dynamics and stability of the replication complex in the context of the living cell, where replication is one of a number of essential cellular processes competing for the genetic material as a template. This competition results in <i>replication conflicts</i>, the stalling or pausing of the replication process in the face of obstacles, including transcription and tightly-bound DNA-binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baharoglu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bidnenko et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boubakri et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brewer, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dutta et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Marsin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Merrikh et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mirkin and Mirkin, 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Soultanas, 2011</a>). Genetic evidence from bacterial studies suggests these replication conflicts can routinely necessitate a replication-restart process at highly-transcribed regions and genes transcribed in the opposite orientation to replication (<a href=\"#bib33\">Merrikh et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Million-Weaver et al., 2015a</a>). However, whether the replisome disassembles in response to conflicts, the rapidity of the restart process, and the frequency of such events per cell cycle are unknown (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bruand et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gabbai and Marians, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lovett, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Marsin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zavitz and Marians, 1992</a>). The current estimates for the number of replication restart events per cell cycle vary greatly, with numbers ranging from one per cell cycle to one in seven generations (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beattie and Reyes-Lamothe, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cox et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Maisnier-Patin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">McGlynn and Lloyd, 2002</a>). However, estimates of less than one event per cell cycle are in conflict with the essentiality of the restart protein PriA in (<i>Bacillus subtilis</i> essentiality is demonstrated in rapid growth [<a href=\"#bib43\">Polard et al., 2002</a>]), and the synthetic lethality of PriB and PriC proteins in <i>Escherichia coli</i> (PriA mutants as well as PriB PriC double mutants are largely unviable [<a href=\"#bib15\">Gabbai and Marians, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sandler and Marians, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sandler et al., 1999</a>]).

However, due to population averaging over cells in various stages of the replication conflict and restart process, ChIP experiments are poor reporters of potential conflict-induced changes to the structure of the replisome complex, the frequency of conflicts in a single cell, and the rapidity of the replication restart process. Therefore understanding the fundamental character of DNA replication and conflicts necessitates a single-cell approach in which conflicts can be observed and quantitatively characterized one event at a time. The molecular-scale stoichiometry of the replisome further necessitates experiments with single-molecule sensitivity to detect any potential changes to replisome structure."

These measurements revealed that a significant percentage of cells only have a single helicase complex and that many of the complexes are short-lived. These results are consistent with pervasive disassembly of replisomes. We find that transcription inhibition both increases the lifetimes and stoichiometry of several core replisome components, suggesting that endogenous replication-transcription conflicts frequently\u00a0lead to disassembly of replisomes, potentially every cell cycle. The replication-conflict induced disassembly model suggests that conflicts may limit the rate of replication.

DnaC was chosen due to its essential role in the replication process, extensive biochemical characterization, its relatively large and well-accepted stoichiometry in the replisome, and because it is the first replisome protein reloaded onto the DNA during PriA-dependent replication restart (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bruand et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Marsin et al., 2001</a>). The replicative helicase is responsible for facilitating replication by unzipping the two strands of DNA ahead of the replication forks. <i>In vitro</i> biochemical studies, including X-ray crystallography, reveal that the helicase forms a homo-hexameric ring encircling the lagging strand of the DNA template (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bailey et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fass et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kaplan et al., 2013</a>). <i>In vivo</i> measurements of stoichiometry in <i>E. coli</i> further support this model in the context of the living cell (<a href=\"#bib45\">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2010</a>). For our studies, we used a DnaC-GFP fusion (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which was expressed from its endogenous promoter, at its endogenous locus. The fusion protein localized to midcell in a replication-dependent manner, consistent with association with the replisome (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lemon and Grossman, 1998</a>). Under our experimental conditions (minimal arabinose medium), the growth rate (and the replication rate\u2014see below) of the DnaC-GFP strain was indistinguishable from that in wild-type cells (During rapid growth in Luria-Bertani medium, DnaC-GFP strain has a minor growth defect [<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>])."

Most bacteria have a circular chromosome and a single origin of replication. After initiation, DNA replication progresses bi-directionally around the chromosome, with two active replisomes in each cell. The two forks in <i>B. subtilis</i> often localize to a single <i>replication factory</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lemon and Grossman, 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The small fraction of cells (~16%) having focus localization inconsistent with a replication factory were excluded from analysis. It is expected that in cells where the replication forks are co-localized, two replicative helicase complexes, and therefore 12 molecules of DnaC, will be localized to the factory (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, stoichiometry analysis of DnaC at the replication factory in cells undergoing active replication reveals that just under half the cells (41%) have a factory with only 6 DnaC proteins, corresponding to a single helicase complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and E</a>). The rest of the population (59%) has 12 DnaC proteins, corresponding to two active helicases. Note that incomplete protein labeling cannot account for the low helicase stoichiometry since two sub-populations with an integer multiple of fundamental hexameric stoichiometry are observed, as has also been previously reported in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib45\">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2010</a>). Western-blot analyses further confirm that\u00a0&gt;98% of DnaC protein in the cell is indeed labeled with GFP (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The incorrect determination of the bleaching step size also cannot account for these observations since results can be reproduced by using an <i>in vitro</i> measure of the fluorophore step size (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). These results are consistent with a model where elongating replisomes are frequently disrupted and disassembled."

We again find that the stoichiometry distribution for co-localized replication forks consists of two sub-populations, with the second (~4 copies) centered at roughly twice the stoichiometry of the first (~2 copies) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Importantly, these sub-populations were similarly proportioned to those observed for DnaC, with roughly 47% of factories having stoichiometries consistent with localization of PolC to only a single replication fork (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). This implied disassembly of the DNA polymerase, in addition to the replicative helicase, further suggests that the replisome is frequently disrupted."

This model predicts that any given replisome complex is shorter lived than the time required to traverse each arm of the chromosome. We visualized the helicase complexes over twenty-two minutes to estimate their lifetimes. In the replisome dynamics measurements, cells were imaged at two-minute intervals such that the helicase complexes can be tracked (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, left image strip; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) over the twenty-two minute time frame without significant bleaching (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Disassembly events correspond to the cooperative loss of all fluorophores simultaneously. Although photobleaching affects our measurement only minimally over the course of the experiment, it would not be possible to visualize the replisome at this frame rate for the entire cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Multiplying the calculated rate of conflicts by the accepted 40 min long replication cycle predicts five conflicts per cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). It is important to note that this estimate has significant systematic uncertainty since it depends on the length of the replication cycle (which depends on growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Helmstetter and Cooper, 1968</a>) as well as the assumption made in the modeling (see <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). A summary of the calculated parameters for the dynamics experiment is included in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. Disassembly of the replisome on the time scale of single replication cycle is consistent with the instability inferred from the analysis of the estimated factory stoichiometry. Furthermore, the inferred frequency of disassembly events is significantly higher than expected from the continuous replication model."

Consistent with the frequent disassembly hypothesis, after inducing PriA depletion in liquid culture for roughly one doubling time, only 13% of cells had foci compared with the roughly 43% of cells with foci in the precursor strain to the PriA CRISPR, which lacks the sgRNA (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

                                "text": "The results described support a model in which replication is discontinuous, with pervasive replisome disassembly and assembly dynamics. Our lab and others have shown that transcription, especially at the highly-transcribed rDNA or head-on genes (those transcribed in the opposite orientation relative to replication), results in potentially severe replication-transcription conflicts (<a href=\"#bib11\">De Septenville et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Merrikh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Million-Weaver et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2007a</a>). Our previous work measuring chromosomal regions where replication conflicts were most prevalent suggested that transcription is the main obstacle to replication (<a href=\"#bib34\">Merrikh et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, if transcription-induced conflicts were the principal mechanism responsible for replisome disassembly, we would predict that inhibition of transcription would result in a significant increase in replisome stability, either as assayed by stoichiometry or direct characterization of complex stability. To test this hypothesis, we perturbed transcription by (i) the treatment of cells with rifampicin (Rif), an antibiotic that directly inhibits transcription initiation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sensi, 1969</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">1983</a>) and (ii) <i>rpoB</i>* mutants which destabilize RNA Polymerase - DNA association and/or rDNA expression (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartlett et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Maughan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou and Jin, 1998</a>). It has been previously shown that <i>rpoB</i>* mutations reduce severity of conflicts significantly (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baharoglu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boubakri et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Guy et al., 2009</a>). Here, we observed that rifampicin treatment dramatically increases the lifetime of helicase complexes. For instance, the number of complexes that persisted longer than 20 min increased from 9% in untreated cells to 53% in rifampicin treated cells and the calculated number of conflicts per cell cycle decreased by a factor of four (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We also isolated and examined an <i>rpoB</i>* mutant strain and found results consistent with those obtained from rifampicin-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This second transcription perturbation ensures that the observed increase in replisome stability is not an artifact of rifampicin treatment. In general, the increased stability of the helicase complex is consistent with the increased stability of the replisome."

An increase in replisome stability would predict an increase in the ratio of cells with two helicase complexes (12 DnaC molecules) relative to the number of cells with one helicase complex (6 DnaC molecules). <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> shows the distribution of protein stoichiometry at the factory in cells with transcription inhibited by rifampicin. The data are clearly consistent with the majority of cells having two active replisomes. There was a significant increase in the percentage of cells containing two stable helicase complexes relative to cells containing one helicase complex in the <i>rpoB</i>* mutant backgrounds as well (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and D</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

                                "text": "Our data imply that replication-transcription conflicts increase the instability of replisome complexes. To test this model, we introduced an IPTG inducible <i>lacZ</i> gene (P<i><sub>spank(hy)</sub>-lacZ</i>) onto the chromosome in the head-on orientation (strain <i>lacZ</i>). We hypothesized that the induction of this ectopic conflict would further destabilize the replisome, leading to a reduction in the fraction of cells containing two intact helicase complexes relative to the control cells. As predicted, analysis of the single-molecule stoichiometry of DnaC in cells experiencing the additional severe engineered conflict (after addition of IPTG to induce <i>lacZ</i> expression) decreases the number of cells containing two intact helicase complexes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a>; &gt;80% of cells contain only 6 rather than 12 molecules of DnaC in the factory), demonstrating that replication-transcription conflicts indeed lead to the disassembly of the replicative helicase complexes. We note that insertion of the <i>lacZ</i> gene in the co-directional orientation leads to a small, but detectable decrease in the number of cells with two assembled helicase complexes under induced conditions (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is consistent with previous reports from our lab showing\u00a0that highly-transcribed co-directional genes can lead to conflicts as assayed by ChIP-qPCR experiments (<a href=\"#bib33\">Merrikh et al., 2015</a>). Control experiments showed that the addition of IPTG to cells without the <i>lacZ</i> construct did not cause a significant shift in the stoichiometry distribution (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results (summarized in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) altogether reveal that the inferred instability and disassembly of the helicase complexes, and potentially the replisome, is transcription-dependent.

DnaC is required for the loading of the replicative helicase (DnaB), and is recruited to rescue stalled replication forks (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sandler, 2000</a>). Here, we disrupted the restart process using a temperature-sensitive version of the helicase loader protein (<i>dnaC2</i> allele) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2008</a>). We visualized DnaB-YPet in the <i>dnaC2</i> mutant under non-permissive conditions (37\u00b0C) using the same technique as in the dynamics experiments (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Helicase complexes observed in the first frame disassembled before the end of the time course in 86% of cases. Furthermore, new complexes rarely developed (15% of the time). To further quantitate this data, we calculate the probability of observing a focus as a function of time in cells that have at least one focus. In the strains containing the <i>dnaC2</i> allele, this probability decreases throughout the time series, consistent with failure to restart (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). This observed loss of foci is too rapid to be explained by replication termination (see <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, null hypothesis). In contrast, the probability of observing a focus in the wild type strain (at 37\u00b0C) does not depend strongly on time, indicating that the replisome is in steady state due to its ability to restart. These data are consistent with reports suggesting that <i>dnaCts</i> alleles are ineffective for synchronization because replication does not proceed to completion (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ferullo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Maisnier-Patin et al., 2001</a>). Overall, these findings are consistent with both our observations in <i>B. subtilis</i> and our interpretations of the results of the <i>E. coli</i> stoichiometry measurements, suggesting that <i>E. coli</i> cells also experience pervasive replisome instability due to transcription."

It takes roughly 40 min to replicate 4.2 and 4.6 Mb of DNA in <i>B. subtilis</i> and <i>E. coli,</i> respectively; at the 500 bp/s \u22121 kb/sec measurements from <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kornberg, 1992</a>), which assume replisome stability during a replication cycle. However, our observation of frequent conflicts (during which the replisome stalls) predicts that the <i>in vivo</i> rates should increase if conflicts are reduced. To test the prediction of our model, we measured the rate of thymidine incorporation with and without rifampicin treatment, as well as in the <i>rpoB*</i> strains \u2013 two different conditions where we observed the stabilization of the replisome. As predicted, both transcription perturbations (rifampicin and <i>rpoB*</i>) increase the replication rate: Thymidine incorporation rates in rifampicin-treated cells are roughly 60\u201365% higher than that measured for untreated cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The consistency of the incorporation rate in the <i>rpoB*</i> strain with rifampicin treatment suggests that the observed increase in rates is probably <i>not</i> an artifact of changes in nucleotide uptake in rifampicin-treated cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wang et al., 2007b</a>). This interpretation is also supported by the insensitivity of <i>rpoB*</i> strains to rifampicin treatment with regards to thymidine incorporation rates. In addition, measurements of the thymidine incorporation rates in DnaC-GFP cells provide further evidence that DnaC-GFP is functional during slow growth: We did not detect any difference in thymidine incorporation rates between the wild-type and the DnaC-GFP strain under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These results provide further evidence that the rate of replication is severely inhibited by transcription in wild-type cells."

We previously showed that replication restart proteins preferentially associate with these regions during fast growth (<a href=\"#bib34\">Merrikh et al., 2011</a>). Although somewhat counterintuitive, our model predicts that replication rates should be slower during fast growth due to conflicts with transcription. To test this prediction, we measured replication-rates in slow and fast growth conditions. Despite the faster growth rate of <i>B. subtilis</i> on minimal glucose versus arabinose medium, we observe significantly higher thymidine incorporation rates in arabinose compared to glucose, where ribosomal RNA and protein genes are much more highly expressed and are a major source of conflicts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, and <a href=\"#bib40\">Mirouze et al., 2011</a>)."

Yet, a great part of this work has relied on a combination of <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution, from which potentially essential cellular factors and/or processes are absent, or <i>in vivo</i> ensemble measurements which are sensitive only to ensemble-averaged cellular behavior. Based primarily on these results and the absence of significant evidence to the contrary, DNA replication was thought to be largely a continuous process that initiates at the origin and moves processively to the terminus. However, there is a contradiction to this widely-accepted model: Our laboratory and others have demonstrated that the replication process can be disrupted from a number of concurrent processes including transcription. The resulting replication conflicts have dire consequences in the absence of rapid and efficient replication restart. If transcription is both an obstacle to the replisome and active throughout the cell cycle, how can the replication process be continuous? If conflicts can occur, what is their frequency? And if these events are frequent, what are the consequences for the replication machinery?"

The results of the <i>replicative helicase complex stoichiometry</i> experiments could be explained by a number of models. It is conceivable that the replisome traverses one of the two arms of chromosome much more rapidly than the other, reaching the terminus and disassembling much earlier than the second replisome complex. However, genomic DNA analyses have already demonstrated that in growing cells, the copy number of the two arms are roughly equal, implying that the average rate of replisome movement on the two arms is about the same (<a href=\"#bib53\">Srivatsan et al., 2010</a>). Another model for the low observed replisome stoichiometry is the observation of individual forks, as has previously been reported in <i>E. coli</i>. But, our own quantitative characterization of replisome localization reveals factory-like (co-localized) replisome positioning for 80% of the cell cycle in both <i>E. coli</i> and <i>B. subtilis</i>, which cannot account for the low observed stoichiometry in our own experiments (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mangiameli et al., 2017</a>) or previous work (<a href=\"#bib45\">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2010</a>). The data presented here is most consistent with the model that elongating replisomes are frequently disrupted (roughly 50% of the time) and disassembled during a single replication cycle."

An external phase plate (Ti-C CLWD Ph3 Annulus Module) was inserted into the beam path during phase-contrast imaging and retracted for fluorescence imaging to avoiding decreased signal due to the neutral density annulus on the phase plate. The microscope focus was controlled by an IR-autofocus system. In short, an infrared beam was reflected off the coverslip-media interface and the back reflection is detected by a position-sensitive detector (PSD). The displacement was then processed using a PID feedback system to control the z-height of the piezo stage."

Instead, we use a parameter-free change-point (CP) analysis to idealize the bleaching curves (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wiggins, 2015</a>). The analysis of simulated intensity traces (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) with similar statistical properties to the observed data illustrates our method for calculating stoichiometry, and the performance of our CP idealization compared to the SED filter. We provide a more detailed discussion of the comparison of the CP method to competing methods in the following sections."

Instead, we selected the largest peak in the power spectrum, as illustrated by the dotted red line (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This approach resulted in the reliable determination of the unitary step in simulations. We show a histogram estimating unitary step size (relative to the true step size) in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. In our simulations, the Leake et al. method (using the SED filter) resulted in a greater number of failures to correctly identify the unitary step. Most worrying of all, the SED filter lead to a fairly frequent identification of the unitary step as roughly twice the true unitary step, leading to anomalous counts of complexes with half the true stoichiometry."

For higher intensities than those shown in the simulation, the CP algorithm cannot reliably determine the steps, although the CP idealization represents an optimal guess (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wiggins, 2015</a>). One might worry that these imprecisely-determined high-intensity steps could result in a significant degradation in the pairwise distribution function, but there are two natural mechanisms for the suppression of their contribution: (i) The short duration of these steps in frames and the large std both result in a small Fisher Information. (ii) Furthermore the weighting in the PPDD is proportional to the lifetime of the step. Therefore these short steps have a much weaker role in determining the single-fluorophore intensity than the long-lived and less noisy steps at the end of the bleaching trace (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wiggins, 2015</a>)."

To compare the performance of the KV and CP filters, we simulated intensity data with no transitions. For simplicity, we used a Gaussian process with unit variance for 120 frames for 10,000 independent simulated datasets. We then idealized this data using both the KV and CP filters. <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a> for the analysis of 10 typical simulated traces and their idealization using both the KV and CP filters. The KV algorithm has a Type I error (finding at least one false transition) 45% of the time! (See the bar plot of algorithm performance in <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) This result implies that data analysis is performed with a 55% confidence level in a Neyman-Pearson Hypothesis Test. Such a small confidence level is clearly unacceptable from a canonical frequentist perspective. In contrast, the Type I error rate for the CP filter is 5%, corresponding to a 95% confidence level. (Although the above simulation describes a scenario under which the KV filter leads to significant over-fitting, in other circumstances, the KV filter can result in significant under-fitting and therefore should not be used for quantitative applications.)"

The ability of the CP algorithm to resolve steps depends principally on the lifetime of the states and the step size between states. To estimate the resolution of the CP filter in step determination, we first simulated transitions from one to zero flours (the final bleaching step) using a constant lifetime equal to the inverse observed intensity decay rate (t<sub>b</sub>\u00a0=\u00a041 frames). The Fixed-Lifetime curve in <a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a> shows the detection efficiency for the bleaching step as a function of step size. In our experiments, the step-size to the standard deviation ratio (\u0394\u00b5/\u03c3) is between 2 and 3. Under these conditions, the step detection efficiency is essentially unity. Of course, the last bleaching step has a distribution of lifetimes, rather than a fixed lifetime equal to the mean lifetime. Next we simulated photobleaching events with variable lifetimes (i.e. stochastic lifetimes with a bleaching rate of k\u00a0=\u00a01/41 frames). The variable-lifetime curve shows the detection efficiency for the bleaching step as a function of step size. Unlike the Fixed-lifetime curve, the variable-lifetime curve never reaches unity due to the existence of a small subset of events that are not long enough to resolve. In spite of the inability to resolve very short-lived states, the detection efficiency is still roughly 90% in the simulation at the observed signal to noise ratio (\u0394\u00b5/\u03c3 \u2248 2.5)."

In short, foci are detected and fit to a Gaussian point-spread function in each frame. Up to four foci are identified per cell. Each focus is assigned a score (as described in the section titled \u2018Focus scores\u2019 above). The larger the score the more confidence the algorithm has identified a true focus (versus a stochastic fluctuation is fluorescence intensity).

We have also required that trajectories last a minimum of three frames. Shorter-lived events are consistent with events observed in cells without active replication, and therefore we believe that these events are also predominantly the result of stochastic fluctuations in fluorescence intensity.

The CRISPR system was fully induced by the addition of 1% xylose in liquid culture roughly 2 hr before imaging to allow the remaining PriA to be diluted out. DnaC-GFP foci were then identified from snapshot images (one phase contrast and one fluorescence image at each field of view). The number of cells with foci was quantified using the following rules: (i) the focus must score three or higher, (ii) the elipticity of the focus must be smaller than 1.2, and (iii) the focus localization must be consistent with the replisome. Because of the leakiness of the CRISPR, we compare to the number of foci in the precursor strain (does not contain sgRNA), also with the addition of 1% xylose. Time-lase microscopy was not productive because the PriA CRISPR strain formed few DnaC-GFP foci even without induction."

Relying exclusively on the single-molecule microscopy is a recipe for disaster. The authors clearly agree, as they state in the second to last paragraph of the manuscript: \"Due to the low intensity of single fluorescent molecules, both the stoichiometry and dynamics experiments are technically challenging. In addition, the bacteria themselves are subject to photo damage at the intensities required to resolve single molecules, and this photo damage itself affects cellular processes and replication in particular. Therefore, it is essential to consider these measurements in the context of additional corroboratory biochemical and genetic evidence. The essentiality of restart proteins and the measurement of the replication rates provide independent lines of evidence for the pervasive disassembly model.\" I agree fully with the authors here that the photobleaching and photodamage that is occurring during their experiments is indeed likely affecting cellular processes and DNA replication, which means that relying on the single-molecule microscopy alone is extremely dangerous. So, the question then is what data help corroborate the microscopy? The authors cite two things: (1) The authors cite the measurements of replication rates in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. These data are fine, but say nothing about the frequency of replication fork collapse per cell cycle. Slower nucleotide incorporation rates could occur from replication slowing down without the replisome fully disassembling and reassembling. In short, these data are loosely consistent with the authors' favored model, but do not incisively probe the issue. (2) The essentiality of restart proteins like PriA. The Polard et al. 2002 study of <i>B. subtilis</i> PriA did indeed show that cells with mutant priA are quite sick, bordering on essential. But it's still not clear whether it's essential because it's required <i>every</i> cell cycle multiple times or because it's required once every few cell cycles. Simply examining plating efficiency only says priA mutants are essential, but it doesn't say how often the protein is required. What is needed is a means of rapidly shutting off PriA activity (via a temp. sensitive allele or induced degradation) and then to examine what happens in individual cells. In other words: The fact that Pri proteins are essential in the sense that mutants cannot be readily recovered on plates does <i>not</i> imply that these proteins are required multiple times every single cell cycle. That conclusion requires an analysis of single cells, immediately after the factor of interest has been eliminated. This is a very straightforward experiment that could help to bolster the authors' conclusion (or not)."

In addition, what's confusing is that the number of conflicts here needs the disappearance of both forks, implying that they are coupled? But the stoichiometry section clearly has many cells with one stable fork, so they are not counted as conflicts in the lifetime measurement? The authors should more clearly address the differences in what's being measured between the lifetime and stoichiometry experiments, and how the numbers add up and any discrepancies here."

Therefore, solving 2p(1-p) = 0.5 leads to p = 0.5, hence 20 min per 40 min cycle).

Therefore, the enhanced thymidine incorporation could still be due to an indirect effect of transcription inhibition, but not direct effect of transcription-replication conflict. Different growth conditions could have the same indirect effect as well. Could the authors use some dyes that can monitor membrane potentials such as the live/death kit of Invitrogen or something similar to verify this possibility?

Relying exclusively on the single-molecule microscopy is a recipe for disaster. The authors clearly agree, as they state in the second to last paragraph of the manuscript: \"Due to the low intensity of single fluorescent molecules, both the stoichiometry and dynamics experiments are technically challenging. In addition, the bacteria themselves are subject to photo damage at the intensities required to resolve single molecules, and this photo damage itself affects cellular processes and replication in particular. Therefore, it is essential to consider these measurements in the context of additional corroboratory biochemical and genetic evidence. The essentiality of restart proteins and the measurement of the replication rates provide independent lines of evidence for the pervasive disassembly model.\" I agree fully with the authors here that the photobleaching and photodamage that is occurring during their experiments is indeed likely affecting cellular processes and DNA replication, which means that relying on the single-molecule microscopy alone is extremely dangerous. So, the question then is what data help corroborate the microscopy? The authors cite two things: (1) The authors cite the measurements of replication rates in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. These data are fine, but say nothing about the frequency of replication fork collapse per cell cycle. Slower nucleotide incorporation rates could occur from replication slowing down without the replisome fully disassembling and reassembling. In short, these data are loosely consistent with the authors' favored model, but do not incisively probe the issue. (2) The essentiality of restart proteins like PriA. The Polard et al. 2002 study of B. subtilis PriA did indeed show that cells with mutant priA are quite sick, bordering on essential. But it's still not clear whether it's essential because it's required every cell cycle multiple times or because it's required once every few cell cycles. Simply examining plating efficiency only says priA mutants are essential, but it doesn't say how often the protein is required. What is needed is a means of rapidly shutting off PriA activity (via a temp. sensitive allele or induced degradation) and then to examine what happens in individual cells. In other words: The fact that Pri proteins are essential in the sense that mutants cannot be readily recovered on plates does not imply that these proteins are required multiple times every single cell cycle. That conclusion requires an analysis of single cells, immediately after the factor of interest has been eliminated. This is a very straightforward experiment that could help to bolster the authors' conclusion (or not).</i> "

The new data using CRISPRi to knockdown priA are a step in the right direction but incomplete and inconclusive right now. The authors can clearly knockdown priA, but the timing of knockdown is not characterized, which is important here. There is a single snapshot analysis done suggesting fewer foci in the priA knockdown, but the images shown in the supplement are very, very difficult to interpret; relatively few cells are shown, the foci in both the experiment and control strain are not nearly as clear as in other parts of the paper and the DnaC-GFP levels overall appear substantially reduced in the priA strain. Moreover, there's no demonstration that the loss of priA leads to an immediate loss in viability, only that the priA CRISPRi strain losses plating viability \u2013 but as noted previously, this doesn't distinguish between fork restart being required every cell cycle vs. once every few cell cycles, which is the key issue here.</i> "

Nonetheless, we would like to point out that we were able to perform the experiment suggested by the reviewer (visualization of the helicase immediately after disruption of restart) in <i>E. coli</i>. We showed that disruption of restart via a temperature sensitive version of the helicase loader protein (<i>dnaC2</i> allele) lead to loss of the DnaB-YPet focus before the end of the 20 minute time course in 80% percent of cases. We can infer (but are unable to observe directly) a 96% of focus disassembly before the end of a 40 minute replication cycle. Additionally, we note that 40 minutes is an upper limit on how quickly replication can be completed, and provides the most conservative estimate for the number of conflicts per cell cycle. This strongly supports at least one disassembly event per replication cycle."

However, due to leaky expression of the CRISPR system, PriA was already depleted threefold prior to induction (Peters, 2016). Because of this, even the uninduced priA CRISPR strain showed substantially reduced numbers of DnaC-GFP foci. After induction, so few foci remained at the start of imaging that time lapse imaging was not productive."
