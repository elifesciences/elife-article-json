Here, we show that interferon alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) is necessary for NRASQ61K-induced transformation and melanoma growth. <i>IFI6</i> was transcriptionally upregulated by NRASQ61K, and knockdown of <i>IFI6</i> resulted in DNA replication stress due to dysregulated DNA replication via E2F2. This stress consequentially inhibited cellular transformation and melanoma growth via senescence or apoptosis induction depending on the RB and p53 pathway status of the cells. NRAS-mutant melanoma were significantly more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of DNA replication stress-inducing drugs, and knockdown of <i>IFI6</i> increased sensitivity to these drugs. Pharmacological inhibition of <i>IFI6</i> expression by the MEK inhibitor trametinib, when combined with DNA replication stress-inducing drugs, blocked NRAS-mutant melanoma growth. Collectively, we demonstrate that IFI6, via E2F2 regulates DNA replication and melanoma development and growth, and this pathway can be pharmacologically targeted to inhibit NRAS-mutant melanoma."

Here, we show that interferon alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) is necessary for NRASQ61K-induced transformation and melanoma growth. <i>IFI6</i> was transcriptionally upregulated by NRASQ61K, and knockdown of <i>IFI6</i> resulted in DNA replication stress due to dysregulated DNA replication via E2F2. This stress consequentially inhibited cellular transformation and melanoma growth via senescence or apoptosis induction depending on the RB and p53 pathway status of the cells. NRAS-mutant melanoma were significantly more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of DNA replication stress-inducing drugs, and knockdown of <i>IFI6</i> increased sensitivity to these drugs. Pharmacological inhibition of <i>IFI6</i> expression by the MEK inhibitor trametinib, when combined with DNA replication stress-inducing drugs, blocked NRAS-mutant melanoma growth. Collectively, we demonstrate that IFI6, via E2F2 regulates DNA replication and melanoma development and growth, and this pathway can be pharmacologically targeted to inhibit NRAS-mutant melanoma."

Some of the most commonly observed oncogenic events in melanoma are activating mutations of the oncogenic neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS; typically NRASQ61K/R), which occur in 20% of cases (<a href=\"#bib30\">Miller and Mihm, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tsao et al., 2012</a>). Oncogenic NRAS causes constitutive activation of NRAS, resulting in activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways. These signaling pathways promote proliferation and reduce apoptosis to facilitate cellular transformation, tumor growth, and metastatic progression (<a href=\"#bib18\">Downward, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Karnoub and Weinberg, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wellbrock et al., 2004</a>). Key pathways regulated by NRAS include the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS) pathways, all of which are shown to play important roles in NRAS-driven oncogenesis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Downward, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Karnoub and Weinberg, 2008</a>)."

However, other pro-survival pathways can be activated by feedback and crosstalk from the pathway being targeted.

For this and several other known and unknown reasons, these approaches have not proven clinically beneficial (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baines et al., 2011</a>).

We identified interferon alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) as a new regulator of oncogenic NRAS-induced melanocyte transformation and melanoma tumor growth, which functions by regulating E2F2 expression and consequently DNA replication. Surprisingly, we also found that NRAS-mutant melanoma cells were significantly more resistant to the drugs that induce DNA replication stress than were BRAF-mutant, NF1-deficient, or triple wild-type melanomas. In addition, treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib, which reduces IFI6 expression, when combined with drugs that induce DNA replication stress, potently inhibited NRAS-mutant melanoma tumor growth in cell culture and in mice. Taken together, our results identify a new role for IFI6 in E2F2-mediated regulation of DNA replication and melanoma development and growth. These studies also uncover a pharmacologically tractable DNA replication stress resistance pathway that can be targeted to inhibit NRAS-mutant melanoma."

Toward this end, we employed RAS mutants that specifically activate either the MAPK (HRAS v12 S35) or PI3K pathway (HRAS v12 C40). Using these mutants, we found that the MAPK pathway stimulated <i>IFI6</i> expression effectively in MEL-ST cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>). To confirm this finding, we used the constitutively active MEK construct MEK-DD (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boehm et al., 2007</a>) and found that the introduction of MEK-DD in MEL-ST cells was sufficient to stimulate <i>IFI6</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>). Finally, we analyzed the expression of <i>IFI6</i> and key MAPK transcriptional targets in 20 patient-derived melanoma samples. We observed that <i>IFI6</i> expression strongly correlated with the expression of other known MAPK transcriptional targets (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Additionally, IFI6 overexpression significantly correlated with the NRAS mutation status in patient-derived melanoma samples (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">Haqq et al., 2005</a>).

Therefore, we asked whether BRAFV600E or <i>NF1</i> knockdown could result in the transcriptional upregulation of <i>IFI6</i>, similar to NRASQ61K. To this end, we either introduced BRAFV600E or knocked down <i>NF1</i> expression in MEL-ST cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). As controls, we used empty vector or non-specific (NS) small hairpin RNA (shRNA), respectively. These cells were then analyzed for <i>IFI6</i> expression by RT-qPCR and immunoblot analysis. Our results showed that BRAFV600E, similar to NRASQ61K, was able to activate IFI6 expression. However, <i>NF1</i> knockdown did not result in <i>IFI6</i> upregulation (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Toward this end, we analyzed the promoter of <i>IFI6</i> using rVISTA2.0 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Loots and Ovcharenko, 2004</a>) and identified DNA binding sites for transcription factors NF-\u03baB and STAT1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). To test if NF-\u03baB or STAT1 directly regulate <i>IFI6</i> transcription, we first performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells showed enrichment of NF-\u03baB on the <i>IFI6</i> promoter relative to MEL-ST cells expressing an empty vector (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). However, we did not observe enrichment for STAT1 on the <i>IFI6</i> promoter in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells relative to MEL-ST cells expressing an empty vector (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). To further test whether NF-\u03baB and STAT1 influence <i>IFI6</i> mRNA expression, we measured the expression of <i>IFI6</i> in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells after knocking down the expression of either <i>NF-</i>\u03ba<i>B (p65/ RelA)</i> or <i>STAT1</i>. We found that <i>NF-\u03baB</i> knockdown markedly decreased <i>IFI6</i> expression in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1L\u2013M</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), whereas <i>STAT1</i> knockdown had no effect (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). We also determined the mechanism of NF-\u03baB activation downstream of NRASQ61K. To this end, we knocked down the expression of <i>IKK\u03b2</i>, a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates I\u03baB; I\u03baB inhibits NF-\u03baB by preventing its nuclear localization (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 1999a</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">1999b</a>). IKK\u03b2 was previously shown to be necessary for NF-\u03baB activity and HRASv12-driven melanoma growth in mice (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yang et al., 2010</a>). Knockdown of <i>IKK\u03b2</i> resulted in reduced phosphorylation of I\u03baB (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) and reduced NF-\u03baB reporter activity (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Analysis of IFI6 also revealed that <i>IKK\u03b2</i> knockdown attenuated NRAS-induced <i>IFI6</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). ChIP analysis showed decreased enrichment of NF-\u03baB on the <i>IFI6</i> promoter upon <i>IKK\u03b2</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that NRASQ61K, in a MAPK pathway-dependent manner via NF-\u03baB, stimulates the transcription of <i>IFI6</i>."

Toward this end, we knocked down the expression of <i>IFI6</i> using shRNA in MEL-ST cells, and then we introduced the NRASQ61K mutant via lentiviral infection. These cells were tested for their ability to form colonies in soft agar and tumors in mice. We found that <i>IFI6</i> knockdown inhibited the ability of NRASQ61K to transform MEL-ST cells, as shown by the reduced colony formation in soft agar (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and tumor formation in mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

                                "text": "After confirming the role of IFI6 in the regulation of melanocyte transformation and melanoma growth, we asked how IFI6 regulates these phenotypes. To answer this question, we knocked down the expression of <i>IFI6</i> in the NRAS-mutant melanoma cell line YUGASP and performed a microarray analysis (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B and 1C</a>). We found that the loss of <i>IFI6</i> expression resulted in increased expression of transcription factor <i>E2F2</i> and its target genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), many of which were previously documented to regulate DNA replication (e.g., <i>CCNE1, MCM3, MCM10</i>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aladjem, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Coverley et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Thu and Bielinsky, 2013</a>). We observed the same results in two additional NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines, M318 and SKMEL-103 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, consistent with the increased level of <i>E2F2</i> mRNA, we observed increased E2F2 protein level and increased E2F2 enrichment on the promoter of its target gene <i>MCM10</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Analysis of other E2F family genes in NRAS-mutant cells, MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells and primary human melanocytes after <i>IFI6</i> knockdown revealed no changes in the expression of other E2F genes (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the loss of <i>IFI6</i> results in dysregulated DNA replication via E2F2 upregulation, which in turn blocks NRAS-mutant melanoma tumor growth and melanomagenesis. To test this likelihood, we analyzed the DNA content of YUGASP cells expressing either <i>IFI6</i> or NS shRNA by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). YUGASP cells expressing <i>IFI6</i> shRNA displayed a significantly higher percentage of cells in S phase than the cells expressing NS shRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Next, to test if <i>IFI6</i> knockdown results in dysregulation of the DNA replication process, we used a DNA fiber assay to directly measure DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib29\">Merrick et al., 2004</a>). Toward this end, we analyzed YUGASP cells expressing <i>IFI6</i> or NS shRNA. Our results showed that the loss of <i>IFI6</i> resulted in dysregulated DNA replication, as observed by significantly fewer ongoing DNA replication forks, significantly more stalled forks, and a significantly higher number of newly fired origins of replication compared to melanoma cells expressing NS shRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4C\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This result also explains the high number of cells in S phase of the cell cycle."

                                "text": "Based on these results, we tested whether immortalized melanocytes expressing NRASQ61K behaved similarly to the NRAS-mutant melanoma cells and primary human melanocytes that show regulation of E2F2 and its target genes. In complete agreement with our previous results, expression of NRASQ61K resulted in increased <i>IFI6</i> expression and decreased expression of E2F2 and its target genes in MEL-ST cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We also observed dysregulated DNA replication in NRASQ61K-transformed MEL-ST cells expressing <i>IFI6</i> shRNA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, senescence induction was not observed in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells expressing <i>IFI6</i> shRNA (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This is consistent with the fact that the MEL-ST cells express the SV40 early region (SV40-ER) and thus inactivate both p53 and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) pathways. However, previous studies have shown that uncontrolled DNA replication-induced DNA damage can result in apoptosis induction even in the absence of p53 and RB (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aladjem et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Knudsen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Strasser et al., 1994</a>). Therefore, we asked whether loss of <i>IFI6</i> results in apoptosis induction when p53 and RB are inhibited. To this end, we tested anchorage-independent cell growth in plates coated with poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-HEMA) and using the recently developed growth in low attachment (GILA) assay (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rotem et al., 2015</a>). We found that loss of <i>IFI6</i> in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells increased apoptosis under anchorage-independent growth conditions compared to NS shRNA-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C\u2013D</a>). We confirmed these results by annexin V staining and immunoblot analysis of cleaved caspase 3 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013F</a>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that upon p53 and RB pathway inactivation, <i>IFI6</i> loss results in the upregulation of <i>E2F2</i> and its target genes involved in DNA replication. This, in turn, causes DNA replication stress and consequent DNA damage, thereby inducing apoptosis. However, when the p53 and/or RB pathway is intact, <i>IFI6</i> loss results in the induction of cellular senescence. This consequentially inhibits mutant NRAS-induced melanocyte transformation and melanoma growth."

Toward this end, we tested the response of NRAS-mutant melanoma cells to drugs that induce cytotoxicity by inducing DNA replication stress. We treated NRAS-mutant (YUGASP, SKMEL-2, SKMEL-103, and M318), BRAF-mutant (SKMEL-28 and A375), NF1-mutant/null (MeWo and YUTOGS), and NRAS/BRAF/NF1 wild-type (YUVON) melanoma cells with three DNA replication stress-inducing agents: aphidicolin, camptothecin, and hydroxyurea (<a href=\"#bib19\">Durkin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">O'Connell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Petermann et al., 2010</a>). We found that NRAS-mutant melanoma cells were significantly more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of DNA replication stress-inducing drugs compared to other genotypes (BRAF-mutant, NF1-deficient, or triple wild-type) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Furthermore, we noted that the knockdown of <i>IFI6</i> sensitized NRAS-mutant cells to DNA replication stress-inducing agents (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), and this effect was rescued by simultaneous knockdown of both <i>E2F2</i> and <i>IFI6</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Because we had observed that the MAPK pathway regulates IFI6, we tested whether pharmacological MEK inhibitors could be combined with DNA replication stress-inducing drugs to treat NRAS-mutant melanoma. Remarkably, we found that simultaneous treatment of NRAS-mutant cells with the MEK inhibitor trametinib and either hydroxyurea or aphidicolin resulted in significantly stronger melanoma growth inhibition in cell culture (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>) and in mice (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>) than either drug alone. These results were surprising because <i>IFI6</i> was also upregulated by the BRAFV600E mutation. Therefore, we asked if <i>E2F2</i> and its target genes involved in the regulation of DNA replication were upregulated in BRAF-mutant, NF1-deficient, or triple wild-type melanoma cells deficient in <i>IFI6</i>. To do so, we knocked down the expression of <i>IFI6</i> and measured the expression of <i>E2F2</i> and its target genes (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We did not observe similar changes in mRNA levels of <i>E2F2</i> or its target genes after <i>IFI6</i> knockdown in BRAF-mutant or NF1-deficient melanoma cell lines (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results indicate that only in the context of NRASQ61K, <i>IFI6</i> loss results in <i>E2F2</i> upregulation, which induces the expression of E2F2 target genes that regulate DNA replication. Thus, the ability of IFI6 to regulate DNA replication stress originates in its ability to repress <i>E2F2</i> and its target genes specifically in the context of NRAS-mutant melanoma. Collectively, these results demonstrate that NRASQ61K upregulates <i>IFI6</i>, consequently repressing <i>E2F2</i>, thereby conferring resistance to drugs that induce cytotoxicity by causing DNA replication stress. This genetically vulnerable pathway can be targeted pharmacologically by combining a MEK inhibitor with cytotoxic agents that induce DNA replication stress to potently inhibit NRAS-mutant melanoma growth."

Second, we report a previously undocumented role for IFI6 in E2F2-mediated regulation of DNA replication. We show that oncogenic NRAS stimulates IFI6 expression to facilitate melanocyte transformation and tumor growth. The loss of IFI6 results in E2F2-mediated dysregulation of DNA replication, resulting in cellular senescence or apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition. Finally, we show that NRAS-mutant melanomas are significantly more resistant to cytotoxic agents that function by inducing DNA replication stress than wild-type NRAS melanoma cells. These observations are highly significant because they uncover a previously undocumented genetic vulnerability that is pharmacologically amenable and can be targeted to treat NRAS-mutant melanoma. These results also have important clinical implications because there are currently no effective therapies for NRAS-mutant melanoma."

Among these, their roles in resisting and controlling pathogens are well established (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schneider et al., 2014</a>). For example, many RNA viruses that induce the interferon response activate the expression of ISGs. This activation allows host cells to control the viral infection (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schneider et al., 2014</a>). This phenomenon is observed in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who receive IFN-\u03b1-based drug regimens. In patients who respond to this treatment, expression of ISGs is low in the liver before treatment and increases significantly after treatment (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, increased expression of 36 unique ISGs correlated with a reduction in HCV viral load (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brodsky et al., 2007</a>). It is important to note that some viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), have been shown to use specific ISGs, such as RSAD2, to enhance infection (<a href=\"#bib44\">Seo et al., 2011</a>). We found that three ISGs\u2014IFI6, IFI27, and MX1\u2014were transcriptionally upregulated by oncogenic NRAS and other oncogenic RAS proteins in a MAPK pathway-dependent manner. These results show that the introduction of oncogenic RAS into human cells induces responses similar to those seen during viral infections, and oncogenic NRAS uses ISGs, such as IFI6, to facilitate cellular transformation and tumor growth."

                                "text": "In addition to identifying the role for IFI6 in the regulation of melanoma development and tumor growth, we also discovered a previously undocumented role for IFI6 in the regulation of DNA replication. We found that the inhibition of <i>IFI6</i> by shRNA-mediated knockdown results in upregulation of transcription factor E2F2, which specifically activates its target genes involved in the activation of DNA replication. This upregulation of DNA replication-promoting genes results in dysregulated DNA replication in melanocytes and melanoma cells. Some studies have shown that oncogenes induce DNA replication stress, resulting in cellular senescence (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bartkova et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Di Micco et al., 2006</a>), but the precise mechanism of this process was not clearly illustrated. Here, we provide evidence that loss of IFI6 results in the upregulation of <i>E2F2</i>, which dysregulates DNA replication. This biological process is also necessary for NRAS-induced cellular transformation and for maintaining the NRAS-mutant melanoma tumor growth. The E2F transcription factors are downstream effectors of the retinoblastoma pathway, and their transcriptional activity is required to regulate various genes, including those required for DNA replication and cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bracken et al., 2004</a>). Context-specific roles for different E2F family members have been shown, which further highlights their non-redundant biological functions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Attwooll et al., 2004</a>). Interestingly, we found that the loss of IFI6 results in specific upregulation of E2F2 but not other E2F family genes. This observation suggests a tumor suppressor-like role for E2F2 in NRAS-mutant melanoma. Notably, although E2F family proteins are typically known to activate genes that facilitate cell cycle progression and proliferation, a number of growth inhibitory genes, such as CDKN2C (p18), CDKN2D (p19), CDKN1C (p57), E2F7, RB1 (pRB), and RBL1 are upregulated by E2F proteins during S phase (<a href=\"#bib16\">Di Stefano et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ortega et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sherr and Roberts, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Stott et al., 1998</a>). Thus, one might speculate that the induction of these growth inhibitory genes might be necessary for regulated progression of the cell cycle. For example, activation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as CDKN2C, CDKN2D, and CDKN1C, would hypothetically reduce CDK activity and DNA replication fork firing during late S phase. Interestingly, none of these growth inhibitory targets of E2F were upregulated after <i>IFI6</i> knockdown, which may in part explain why IFI6-mediated upregulation of E2F2 results in dysregulated DNA replication and tumor growth inhibition."

                                "text": "Our studies have identified a novel and clinically significant feature of NRAS-mutant melanoma. We found that cytotoxic agents that typically inhibit growth by inducing DNA replication stress are largely ineffective at inhibiting NRAS-mutant melanomas. In contrast, BRAF-mutant, NF1-deficient, and triple wild-type melanomas were relatively sensitive to these agents. We also confirm resistance to these agents is due in part to the oncogenic NRAS-mediated upregulation of IFI6 and consequential repression of E2F2 and its target genes. Knockdown of <i>IFI6</i> increased the sensitivity of NRAS-mutant melanoma to DNA replication stress-inducing agents, and simultaneous loss of E2F2 and IFI6 rescues this effect. Notably, knockdown of <i>IFI6</i> in BRAF-mutant, NF1-deficient, or triple wild-type melanoma did not alter the expression of <i>E2F2</i> or its target genes. This in part explains the differences in the sensitivity of melanoma genotypes to agents that induce cytotoxicity through DNA replication stress. Because IFI6 is upregulated in NRAS-mutant melanoma, and its expression correlates with NRAS mutation status, this subgroup of melanoma could be targeted using this therapeutic approach. Therefore, the DNA replication stress pathway represents a unique vulnerability of NRAS-mutant melanoma that can be pharmacologically inhibited to achieve tumor inhibition in cell culture and in vivo. Several of the agents we used here, such as aphidicolin, camptothecin, and hydroxyurea, are used in clinical cancer treatment (<a href=\"#bib21\">Geyer and Mesa, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Patel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sargent et al., 1996</a>). Based on our results, we speculate that these drugs will have limited utility in patients harboring NRAS and potentially other RAS mutations. Thus, our results may have clinical application for the identification of patient populations that might benefit from these drugs."

After 48\u2009hr of inhibitor treatment, the cell viability was evaluated. To do this, 20 \u00b5l of 5 mg/ml MTT solution dissolved in 1\u00d7 PBS was added to each well and incubated for 1\u2009hr at 37\u00b0C incubator. The MTT solution was removed gently, and 100 \u00b5l of DMSO were added. After mixing well by pipetting, absorbance was measured at 590 and 630 nm. An average was calculated for both readings, and then measurement at 630 nm was subtracted from that at 590 nm. The relative growth rate was plotted with respect to vehicle-treated control cells."

The authors describe a molecular pathway whereby mutations in the NRAS oncogene lead to upregulation of IFI6 expression via the activation of MEK kinases and the NF-\u03baB transcription factor. Since IFI6 depletion leads to deregulated DNA replication and senescence, the authors propose a model whereby IFI6 upregulation downstream of NRAS is required for cell proliferation and tumor growth."

The manuscript describes a mechanism that is supposedly specific for NRAS-driven melanomas, but reviewers pointed out that the involvement of the RAF-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK pathway indicates that melanomas driven by mutations in BRAF or silencing of NF1 should also display elevated IFI6 mRNA expression. This point should be carefully investigated and clarified. Is IFI6 upregulation unique to NRAS-driven tumors or not? Furthermore, by what mechanism(s) does NRAS-activated RAF-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK activate NF-\u03baB? Is it a direct mechanism of activation or does this occur through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines leading to NF-\u03baB activation? If NRAS activates NF-\u03baB signaling through the RAF-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK pathway as described, then why wouldn't BRAF(V600E) or NF1(Null) melanomas, which have readily detectable pERK1/2 signaling, not also activate IFI6 mRNA expression? Indeed, it was noted that in their \"NRAS wild-type\" melanoma cell lines the authors employed at least one cell line (A375), which expresses BRAF(V600E) and has readily detectable pERK1/2 signaling. In sum, additional experiments are required to provide mechanistic insight into the mechanism of NRAS-mediated IFI6 expression through NF-\u03baB activation and thus clarify the source of specificity (or lack thereof) for NRAS-driven melanoma."

The authors conclude that RNAi-mediated silencing of IFI6 leads to senescence, but this is not well documented and somewhat contradictory. The cells display elevated levels of SA- -\u03b2-gal, a widely used but unreliable marker of senescence, and a decrease in H3K9 acetylation. However, the cells also display increased numbers of cells in S phase, which is contrary to the idea of senescence, an irreversible form of cell cycle arrest generally associated with arrest in G1. How can these observations be reconciled? Could the authors detect evidence of DNA damage such as collapsed DNA replication forks, gH2AX foci and/or the recruitment of RAD51 or 53BP1 into damage sites?"

Since Large T binds to and inhibits the activity of the pRB, p107 and p130 \"pocket proteins\" that are negative regulators of E2F activity, and also to TP53, it is hard to understand mechanistically how senescence could be elicited in cells that are lacking these key tumor suppressors that are known to enforce the senescence program. Moreover, the authors claim that shIFI6 leads to elevated E2F2 mRNA expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) but since, to all intents and purposes, Mel-ST cells are TP53, pRB, p107 and p130 deficient, the significance of this observation is questionable since these cells should already have abundant E2F activity. It is also notable that the authors have not assessed expression of E2F2 protein or the DNA binding/transcriptional activity of E2F2 in the cells under study. The authors claim that their data \"demonstrates that IFI6 is a new regulator of DNA replication\". Of note, IFI6 knockout mice are normal and cells engineered to over-express do not show any obvious alterations in DNA synthesis. It is not clear where IFI6 is located in the cell or whether it is a part of the DNA replication machinery. Hence, there are no hints from previous publications, nor any compelling evidence from this manuscript, that \"IFI6 is a new regulator of DNA replication\". In sum, additional experiments would be needed to clarify the relationship between deregulated IFI6 expression, E2F control, accelerated DNA replication and the establishment of senescence."

The relative sensitivity of NRAS mutated melanoma cells to the cytotoxic effects of DNA replication stress-inducing drugs should be assessed compared to the levels of pERK1/2 signaling and IFI6 expression in the control (NRAS wild-type) cells. Since A375 cells express BRAF(V600E), the differences in sensitivity may not be related to pERK1/2 levels. This should be further investigated and clarified."

The authors conclude that mutational activation of NRAS in melanocytes drives expression of the known interferon-regulated genes IFI6, IFITM1 and MX1. However, this conclusion is not supported by analysis of TCGA data for cutaneous melanoma that comprises ~478 well curated specimens of which 278 specimens are informative for NRAS, BRAF or NF1 mutation and the expression of IFI6, IFITM1 and MX1 mRNAs. Using the MSKCC cBio Portal (<a href=\"http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/\">http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/</a>), one of the Reviewers interrogated this dataset and found no correlation between mutational activation of NRAS and the expression of the IFI6, IFITM1 and MX1 mRNAs. Indeed, mutational activation of NRAS and the expression of these mRNAs tends towards mutual exclusivity. The authors should address this concern, and the revised manuscript should discuss analysis of public datasets, and to what extent these analyses support (or do not) the overall molecular mechanism described here."

The manuscript describes a mechanism that is supposedly specific for NRAS-driven melanomas, but Reviewers pointed out that the involvement of the RAF-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK pathway indicates that melanomas driven by mutations in BRAF or silencing of NF1 should also display elevated IFI6 mRNA expression. This point should be carefully investigated and clarified. Is IFI6 upregulation unique to NRAS-driven tumors or not? Furthermore, by what mechanism(s) does NRAS-activated RAF-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK activate NF-\u03baB? Is it a direct mechanism of activation or does this occur through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines leading to NF-\u03baB activation? If NRAS activates NF-\u03baB signaling through the RAF-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK pathway as described, then why wouldn't BRAF(V600E) or NF1(Null) melanomas, which have readily detectable pERK1/2 signaling, not also activate IFI6 mRNA expression? Indeed, it was noted that in their \"NRAS wild-type\" melanoma cell lines the authors employed at least one cell line (A375), which expresses BRAF(V600E) and has readily detectable pERK1/2 signaling. In sum, additional experiments are required to provide mechanistic insight into the mechanism of NRAS-mediated IFI6 expression through NF-\u03baB activation and thus clarify the source of specificity (or lack thereof) for NRAS-driven melanoma.</i> "

The authors conclude that RNAi-mediated silencing of IFI6 leads to senescence, but this is not well documented and somewhat contradictory. The cells display elevated levels of SA-\u03b2-gal, a widely used but unreliable marker of senescence, and a decrease in H3K9 acetylation. However, the cells also display increased numbers of cells in S phase, which is contrary to the idea of senescence, an irreversible form of cell cycle arrest generally associated with arrest in G1. How can these observations be reconciled? Could the authors detect evidence of DNA damage such as collapsed DNA replication forks, gH2AX foci and/or the recruitment of RAD51 or 53BP1 into damage sites? Furthermore, in their initial gene induction studies and throughout the manuscript that authors employed Mel-ST cells, which are melanocytes immortalized by expression of hTERT and rendered susceptible to oncogenic transformation by expression of the SV40 Large and small T/t antigens. Since Large T binds to and inhibits the activity of the pRB, p107 and p130 \"pocket proteins\" that are negative regulators of E2F activity, and also to TP53, it is hard to understand mechanistically how senescence could be elicited in cells that are lacking these key tumor suppressors that are known to enforce the senescence program. Moreover, the authors claim that shIFI6 leads to elevated E2F2 mRNA expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) but since, to all intents and purposes, Mel-ST cells are TP53, pRB, p107 and p130 deficient, the significance of this observation is questionable since these cells should already have abundant E2F activity. It is also notable that the authors have not assessed expression of E2F2 protein or the DNA binding/transcriptional activity of E2F2 in the cells under study. The authors claim that their data \"demonstrates that IFI6 is a new regulator of DNA replication\". Of note, IFI6 knockout mice are normal and cells engineered to over-express do not show any obvious alterations in DNA synthesis. It is not clear where IFI6 is located in the cell or whether it is a part of the DNA replication machinery. Hence, there are no hints from previous publications, nor any compelling evidence from this manuscript, that \"IFI6 is a new regulator of DNA replication\".

As a result, cells incorporate more nucleotides, which causes a surge of cells in the S phase. Once this uncontrolled replication reaches a threshold level, the cell can no longer divide and therefore undergoes senescence.

Thus, it failed to identify 23 of the 30 29 (796%) BRAF signature genes reported by Kannengiesser et al. Furthermore, only 1 gene showed a significant tendency towards co- occurrence with NRAS-mutant melanoma, and 7 showed a significant tendency toward mutual exclusivity. Finally, only 2 gene showed a significant tendency towards co- occurrence with NF1-deficient melanoma, and only one of these genes were identified to be significant for NRAS-mutant melanoma but not for BRAF-mutant melanoma."

We believe that the lack of correlation between IFI6 expression and NRAS mutation represents a limitation of the TCGA dataset rather than the proof that it is not regulated by the MAPK pathway. Therefore, independent studies, such as ours, should be encouraged and are complementary to the existing literature and large- scale datasets, including TCGA.
