Here we report extensive and direct interactions between these pattern recognition receptors. The promiscuous TLR binders were human SIGLEC-5/9 and mouse Siglec-3/E/F. Mouse Siglec-G did not show appreciable binding to any TLRs tested. Correspondingly, <i>Siglece</i> deletion enhanced dendritic cell responses to all microbial TLR ligands tested, while <i>Siglecg</i> deletion did not affect the responses to these ligands. TLR4 activation triggers Neu1 translocation to cell surface to disrupt TLR4:Siglec-E interaction. Conversely, sialidase inhibitor Neu5Gc2en prevented TLR4 ligand-induced disruption of TLR4:Siglec E/F interactions. Absence of <i>Neu1</i> in hematopoietic cells or systematic treatment with sialidase inhibitor Neu5Gc2en protected mice against endotoxemia. Our data raised an intriguing possibility of a broad repression of TLR function by Siglecs and a sialidase-mediated de-repression that allows positive feedback of TLR activation during infection."

Here we report extensive and direct interactions between these pattern recognition receptors. The promiscuous TLR binders were human SIGLEC-5/9 and mouse Siglec-3/E/F. Mouse Siglec-G did not show appreciable binding to any TLRs tested. Correspondingly, <i>Siglece</i> deletion enhanced dendritic cell responses to all microbial TLR ligands tested, while <i>Siglecg</i> deletion did not affect the responses to these ligands. TLR4 activation triggers Neu1 translocation to cell surface to disrupt TLR4:Siglec-E interaction. Conversely, sialidase inhibitor Neu5Gc2en prevented TLR4 ligand-induced disruption of TLR4:Siglec E/F interactions. Absence of <i>Neu1</i> in hematopoietic cells or systematic treatment with sialidase inhibitor Neu5Gc2en protected mice against endotoxemia. Our data raised an intriguing possibility of a broad repression of TLR function by Siglecs and a sialidase-mediated de-repression that allows positive feedback of TLR activation during infection."

An immune response is triggered when PAMPs and DAMPs are recognized, but the response must be properly controlled.

However, when an immune cell detects a foreign molecule through a TLR, an enzyme called Neu1 is relocated from the inside of the cell to the cell's surface, where it removes the sugar molecules from the TLRs. This disrupts the interaction between the TLRs and the Siglecs, thus activating the receptors and triggering an immune response against the invading pathogen or damaged cells. This represents a newly discovered mechanism that can regulate the signaling of TLRs."

Over the following decades, TLRs have emerged as a family of PRRs that sense a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), ranging from microbial glycan, bacterial glycolipids, flagellin, and viral and bacterial nucleic acids (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kawai and Akira, 2010</a>)."

In addition to TLRs, Nod-like receptors (NLRs) have also been shown to respond to both microbial components (<a href=\"#bib19\">Franchi et al., 2012</a>) and cellular injuries (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ting et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tschopp and Schroder, 2010</a>).

Second, do Siglec family members directly interact with other families of pattern recognition receptors and play a broad function in regulating innate immunity? Here we addressed these two issues by revealing a broad and direct interaction between TLRs and many Siglecs, and by highlighting Siglec-G for its lack of direct interactions with TLR."

The implication of this cardinal feature in immune recognition has not been widely explored. Our previous studies have demonstrated that CD24-Siglec-G interactions are disrupted by bacterial sialidase and that such disruptions exacerbates sepsis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2011</a>). Since most pathogens do not express sialidases, the implication of this observation on immune regulation during infection and autoimmune diseases is less clear. On the other hand, mammals express at least four sialidases, Neu1-4 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miyagi and Yamaguchi, 2012</a>). Several studies have suggested that activation of TLR can be attenuated by sialidase inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amith et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abdulkhalek et al., 2011</a>). Both Neu1 and Neu3 have been suggested as targets of the inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amith et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abdulkhalek et al., 2011</a>). Neu1 has been shown to cause TLR4 dimerization, which was suggested to be important for its regulation of TLR4 activation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amith et al., 2010</a>). Here we report a critical role for Neu1 in regulating Siglec-TLR interaction and endotoxemia. Together, our data reveal an overlooked network of interactions among Siglecs, host sialidases and TLRs and, with more potent Neu1 inhibitors, propose host sialidases as therapeutic targets for lethal endotoxemia."

Likewise, <i>Siglece</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> DC produced at least 10-fold more cytokines in response to CpG (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Given the multiple interactions of Siglec-E with other TLR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), we tested if endogenous Siglec-E negatively regulates production of inflammatory cytokines to other TLR ligands. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, in addition to an enhanced response to TLR4 and TLR9 ligands, <i>Siglece</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> DC also produced significantly more IL-6 in response to synthetic triacylated lipoprotein Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2 agonist), heat-killed <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> (HKLM, Tlr2 agonist), poly(I:C), (TLR3 agonist), <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> flagellin (ST-FLA, TLR5 agonist), synthetic lipoprotein derived from <i>Mycoplasma salivarium</i> (FSL-1, TLR2/6 agonist) and ssRNA40, a 20-mer phosphorothioate-protected single-stranded RNA oligonucleotide containing a GU-rich sequence (TLR8 agonist). Since Siglec-E negatively regulates responses to all TLR ligands tested, we suggest that the physical interactions between Siglec-E and TLRs are biologically significant. Except for a modest elevated response to ssRNA40, <i>Siglecg</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> and <i>Siglecg</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> DC exhibited similar responses to all TLR ligands tested (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This, along with data from our previous report indicating that Siglec-G does not inhibit inflammatory response to LPS and poly(I:C), (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2009</a>), is consistent with the lack of physical interactions between Siglec-G and TLRs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,G</a>)."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, co-precipitation between endogenous TLR4 and Siglec-E was substantially reduced after LPS stimulation. These data demonstrate a dynamic regulation of TLR4-Siglec-E association on DC. Since interaction of Siglecs with their ligands is dependent on sialic acid and can be disrupted by sialidase (<a href=\"#bib15\">Crocker et al., 2007</a>), and since LPS is devoid of sialidase activity, we evaluated the contribution of endogenous sialidase, using the D2SC DC cell line (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bachmann et al., 1996</a>). Real-time PCR analysis indicated that D2SC cells express <i>Neu1</i> and to a lesser extent <i>Neu3</i>, but not <i>Neu2</i> or <i>Neu4</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Since TLR4 is a cell surface glycoprotein while Neu1 is primarily lysosomal, we evaluated whether Neu1 translocates to the cell surface following LPS stimulation. Fluorescent microscopy revealed a robust translocation of Neu1 to cell surface where it co-localized with TLR4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), which is similar to a previous report on macrophages (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liang et al., 2006</a>). Flow cytometry confirmed a time-dependent translocation of Neu1 between 6\u201318 hr following LPS stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

However, since one Siglec can interact with multiple TLRs, and each TLR with multiple Siglecs, it is unlikely that blocking specific Siglecs may significantly impact the susceptibility to endotoxemia. In contrast, as sialidases may regulate multiple Siglec-TLR interactions, targeting host sialidase may be more effective. Indeed, we showed that inhibition of Neu1 by either gene deletion or sialidase inhibitor administration confers a strong protection against endotoxemia. Therefore, Neu1 may serve as a new therapeutic target for endotoxic shock."

We have recently shown bacterial sialidase as a valuable target for polybacterial sepsis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2011</a>). However, most pathogens do not encode sialidase. With the identification of a critical function of endogenous sialidase, we can now extend the potential of this strategy to more sepsis-causing pathogens. Unlike bacterial and viral sialidases, endogenous sialidases may be easier to target as they are both limited in diversity and unlikely to acquire drug resistance through mutation. However, since mutation of Neu1 cause sialidosis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Seyrantepe et al., 2003</a>), it is of interest to consider how potential side-effects associated with Neu1 inactivation may be avoided. Fortunately, our data demonstrate that an effective sialidase inhibitor can confer protection by selectively targeting cell surface Neu1, perhaps by virtue of poor drug accessibility to the intracellular compartment. Therefore, it is feasible to target Neu1 therapeutically without side effects associated with disruption of the intracellular sialidase activity, the known cause of sialidosis."

All constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. For purification of Siglec-G-Fc or Siglec-H-Fc, the corresponding expression vector was co-transfected with a GFP expression vector into 293 T cells, and stable clones were obtained after 2 weeks culture in selection medium containing 2.5 \u03bcg/ml puromycin and 50 \u03bcg/ml Zeocin. The stable clones were amplified and cultured in serum free medium, Siglec-G-Fc or Siglec H-Fc was purified with a protein A column from the cell culture supernatants."

However, further revision seems to be necessary, especially including the confocal microscopy overlay data of these translocated molecules to elucidate their movement and interaction directly, and discussing the working model of Siglec-E appropriately in terms of its broad application."
