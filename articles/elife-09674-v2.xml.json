Several studies indicate that transduction mechanisms are intrinsic to cutaneous neurons and that epidermal keratinocytes only modulate this transduction. Using mice expressing channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in keratinocytes we show that blue light activation of the epidermis alone can produce action potentials (APs) in multiple types of cutaneous sensory neurons including SA1, A-HTMR, CM, CH, CMC, CMH and CMHC fiber types. In loss of function studies, yellow light stimulation of keratinocytes that express halorhodopsin reduced AP generation in response to naturalistic stimuli. These findings support the idea that intrinsic sensory transduction mechanisms in epidermal keratinocytes can directly elicit AP firing in nociceptive as well as tactile sensory afferents and suggest a significantly expanded role for the epidermis in sensory processing."

Several studies indicate that transduction mechanisms are intrinsic to cutaneous neurons and that epidermal keratinocytes only modulate this transduction. Using mice expressing channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in keratinocytes we show that blue light activation of the epidermis alone can produce action potentials (APs) in multiple types of cutaneous sensory neurons including SA1, A-HTMR, CM, CH, CMC, CMH and CMHC fiber types. In loss of function studies, yellow light stimulation of keratinocytes that express halorhodopsin reduced AP generation in response to naturalistic stimuli. These findings support the idea that intrinsic sensory transduction mechanisms in epidermal keratinocytes can directly elicit AP firing in nociceptive as well as tactile sensory afferents and suggest a significantly expanded role for the epidermis in sensory processing."

Sensory neurons are diverse in nature and exhibit unique chemical, morphological and electrophysiological properties that allow specific responses to applied stimuli. In response to stimuli, the skin produces neuroactive substances that are postulated to directly and indirectly modulate the activity of sensory fibers (<a href=\"#bib11\">Groneberg et al., 2005</a>). These substances include glutamate (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nordlind et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Fischer et al., 2009</a>), ATP (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cook and McCleskey, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Inoue et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dussor et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barr et al., 2013</a>), acetylcholine (ACh) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Grando et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Wessler et al., 1998</a>), epinephrine (<a href=\"#bib16\">Khasar et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Pullar et al., 2006</a>), CGRP (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hou et al., 2011</a>), neurotrophic growth factors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Truzzi et al., 2011</a>) and cytokines (<a href=\"#bib31\">Shi et al., 2013</a>). The skin also expresses ligand-gated (glutamate, ATP, nicotinic, muscarinic, 5-hydroxytryptamine, glycine and gamma-aminobutyric) and voltage-gated (sodium, calcium, transient receptor potential [TRP], potassium and cyclic nucleotide) ion channels and growth factor and cytokine receptors (<a href=\"#bib24\">Olah et al., 2012</a>). The expression of neuroactivators and voltage and ion-gated channels indicates that complex autocrine and paracrine signaling between epithelial and neural tissues underlie sensory signaling (<a href=\"#bib4\">Conti-Fine et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Peier et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Atoyan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dussor et al., 2009</a>)."

Testing this in an intact system has been difficult because the complexity in skin-nerve interactions prohibits isolation of the skin and neuronal output (a behavioral reflex or the pattern of axonal firing) since any natural stimulation (e.g., mechanical or thermal) simultaneously affects both keratinocytes and sensory neurons. To address this problem, mice with targeted expression of light-activated channelrhodopsin (ChR2) can be used to determine the contribution of each cell type to cutaneous associated behavior (withdrawal reflex) and generation of afferent APs. For example, Ji and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ji et al., 2012</a>) showed that blue light stimulation of the skin of transgenic rats that expressed ChR2 in primary afferents under the Thy-1.2 promoter exhibited nocifensive type responses. Similarly, Daou et al. (<a href=\"#bib6\">Daou et al., 2013</a>) showed light-induced behavioral sensitivity in mice in which the Nav1.8 promoter drove expression of ChR2 in a subset of primary afferents. In another optogenetic model, Maksimovic and colleagues directed ChR2 expression to the non-neuronal Merkel cells of the epidermis. Using an ex vivo electrophysiologic preparation they showed that blue light stimulation of the isolated skin elicited AP trains in slowly adapting type 1 (SA1) afferents, thus confirming the essential transducer role of Merkel cells in transmission of mechanical stimuli by SA1 tactile afferents."

Similar to Daou et al. (<a href=\"#bib6\">Daou et al., 2013</a>), we found that light stimulation of the skin and activation of ChR2 in sensory afferents elicits robust nocifensive behaviors in mice. Remarkably, for mice that only express ChR2 in skin keratinocytes, light stimulation was also sufficient to generate nocifensive behaviors and regulate firing properties and evoke APs in specific subsets of cutaneous afferents, several which are known to activate in response to painful stimuli. In addition, expression of the chloride pump NpHR3.0 in keratinocytes significantly reduced AP firing in cutaneous afferents. These data indicate that Merkel cells are not unique in their ability to directly generate action potentials in sensory neurons and that light-mediated activation of keratinocytes is sufficient to engage an endogenous mechanism that can directly regulate cutaneous afferent firing."

Electrophysiological recordings were obtained from 80 cells isolated from 16 KRT-ChR2 mice (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Laser activation induced APs in 6 out of 24 unmyelinated nociceptive fiber neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>) and in 4 out of 14 myelinated high-threshold mechanoreceptors (HTMRs) (not shown). These responses in heat-sensitive neurons are not due to laser-generated heat, as measures using a thermistor show minimal rise (\u223c1 \u00b0C) in temperature over the 5 s recording interval. In addition, 3 myelinated HTMR fibers exhibited apparent summation when the laser was presented with natural stimuli. An example of this summation is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>. This myelinated HTMR fiber had a mechanical threshold of 10 mN and neither a 5 mN mechanical stimulus nor the maximal intensity of blue light evoked a response. However, simultaneous application of 5 mN mechanical stimulation and light stimulation was sufficient to elicit APs. Recordings from 18 C-fiber nociceptors were maintained long enough to make multiple presentations of natural, laser and combined laser and natural stimuli. In 12 of these fibers, combined laser and natural stimulation evoked significantly more APs than natural stimuli alone (p &lt; 0.01 paired T-test, n = 12) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). The remaining 6 C-fiber nociceptors did not display any summation when pairing laser and natural stimuli (not shown). Comparison of the functional properties of laser responsive and unresponsive nociceptive fibers revealed no significant differences. Laser activation also elicited AP firing in all 21 myelinated slowly adapting type 1 (SA1) low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs), which is most likely due to activation of Merkel cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Maricich et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Maksimovic et al., 2014</a>), which, like epidermal keratinocytes, express the KRT14 keratin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013J</a>).

This reduction was fiber type dependent with the most pronounced effects in mechanically sensitive C-fiber nociceptors (p = 0.02 Paired T-test n = 7) and slowly adapting type I LTMRs (p &lt; 0.01 Paired T-Test n = 10) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). There were no effects observed on myelinated rapidly adapting LTMRs. It should also be noted that while in some presentations this yellow light-induced reduction in firing was 100% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), the average reduction in affected fibers was lower, that is, 44% in C fibers (n = 12), 48% in A-HTMRs (n = 7) and 44% in 16 SA1 fibers. In addition, in some cases where 100% reduction was observed, on subsequent light exposures the reduction in firing was less pronounced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

For some neuron subtypes, light activation of keratinocytes induces action potential firing similar to that evoked in response to natural stimuli. For other afferents, keratinocyte activation produced sub-threshold effects that potentiated the response to natural stimulation. For example, we recorded from afferents where light activation of keratinocytes alone did not elicit action potentials, but when combined with sub-threshold mechanical stimuli, produced multiple action potentials. These results suggest that keratinocytes are not only intimately involved in the generation of sensory neuron activity, but that the nature of this interaction is heterogeneous, differing for the many subtypes of sensory neurons that innervate the skin. Contributing to this heterogeneity may be the type or relative level of neuroactivator compound released by keratinocytes in response to mechanical, thermal or noxious stimulation or interactions with other cell types or structures in the skin, for example, immune cells or vascular structures."

In these mice capsaicin could evoke nocifensive behaviors and c-fos expression in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons. As capsaicin application should only have activated keratinocyte-expressed TRPV1, it was concluded that these responses, which require activation of nociceptors, were initiated by keratinocytes, which in turn induced firing in primary afferents."

For example, over half of the C-heat (CH) fibers, which only signal noxious heat and express TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jankowski et al., 2012</a>), responded to keratinocyte activation. This suggests that keratinocytes have the ability to communicate directly with neurons that express TRPV1, an ion channel that transmits noxious heat and is required for inflammatory pain signaling (<a href=\"#bib36\">Woodbury et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baumbauer et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, LTMRs afferents, which form lanceolate endings around hair follicles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), were not activated by illumination of the skin in either Prph-ChR2 mice or KRT-ChR2 mice. A possible reason for this may be that these nerve fibers and/or the associated keratinocytes were not effectively illuminated due to the depth of the skin. However, in ongoing studies using Advillin-cre- and trkB-Cre<sup>ER</sup>-ChR2 mice, action potentials can be evoked in A\u03b2 and A\u03b4 LTMRs using the same light stimulus (not shown). Thus, it is possible that in Prph-ChR2 mice, an insufficient level of ChR2 for activation of LTMRs may exist. Another possibility is that the peripherin promoter only targets C-LTMR afferents. Unfortunately, the only cells we recorded from with lanceolate endings in these prreparations were myelinated RA-LTMRs."

It is most likely that keratinocyte activation is one contributor to natural stimuli-evoked sensory signaling (at least for some cells) and, in addition to neuronal activation, is a critical component of sensory transmission. Evidence for this is the clear activation of primary afferents by blue light stimulation of keratinocytes and the observed summation of AP firing in afferents exposed to light and mechanical or thermal stimuli. Importantly, physiological relevance is also indicated by the in vivo nocifensive behavior and clear withdrawal response elicited by light stimulation of KRT-ChR2 mice. These responses were much slower compared to behavioral response times measured in Prph-ChR2 mice, which express the ChR2 ion channel in the primary afferent. This difference may reflect the time needed for release by keratinocytes of neuroactivator compound(s) to a level sufficient to evoke an AP as well as the heterogeneity of fiber types innervating the epidermis. Further study of the types of neuroactivator compounds released by light stimulated ChR2 keratinocytes and the effect of these activators on specific types of primary afferents will address these issues."

The present findings support the idea that keratinocytes, as activators of cutaneous neurons, have a central role in the onset and maintenance of such abnormal transmission. These findings also suggest that altered release of keratinocyte expressed neuromodulators (e.g., ATP, CGRP), neurotransmitters (e.g., ACh) or activity of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels could drive changes in transmission and importantly, may do so in a neuron subtype specific manner."

The paper is important from two angles, firstly at the technical level because it shows that light application to keratinocytes can indirectly activate sensory neurons, and secondly at a conceptual level showing that keratinocyte signalling may have a role in modulating sensory perception. The ChR2 experiments clearly show that optogenetic activation of keratinocytes can evoke activity in several classes of primary afferent neuron. While this had previously been shown for communication between Merkel cells and SA1 afferents, this paper demonstrates that it is also the case for many types of neuron such as A-HTMRs and heat responsive C-fibers, albeit at lower firing frequencies."
