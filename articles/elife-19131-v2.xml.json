Yet, it is often unclear how individual cells within a field of identical cells initiate the patterning process. Using live imaging, quantitative image analyses and modeling, we show that during <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> sepal development, fluctuations in the concentration of the transcription factor ATML1 pattern a field of identical epidermal cells to differentiate into giant cells interspersed between smaller cells. We find that ATML1 is expressed in all epidermal cells. However, its level fluctuates in each of these cells. If ATML1 levels surpass a threshold during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, the cell will likely enter a state of endoreduplication and become giant. Otherwise, the cell divides. Our results demonstrate a fluctuation-driven patterning mechanism for how cell fate decisions can be initiated through a random yet tightly regulated process."

Yet, it is often unclear how individual cells within a field of identical cells initiate the patterning process. Using live imaging, quantitative image analyses and modeling, we show that during <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> sepal development, fluctuations in the concentration of the transcription factor ATML1 pattern a field of identical epidermal cells to differentiate into giant cells interspersed between smaller cells. We find that ATML1 is expressed in all epidermal cells. However, its level fluctuates in each of these cells. If ATML1 levels surpass a threshold during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, the cell will likely enter a state of endoreduplication and become giant. Otherwise, the cell divides. Our results demonstrate a fluctuation-driven patterning mechanism for how cell fate decisions can be initiated through a random yet tightly regulated process."

Wolpert\u2019s French flag model proposes that a group of identical cells differentiate into different cell types based on threshold concentrations of a morphogen gradient (<a href=\"#bib106\">Wolpert, 1996</a>). Each cell responds to the morphogen individually by expressing specific sets of downstream genes determined by the concentration sensed. This model has successfully explained the formation of various animal tissue patterns ranging from Bicoid anterior-posterior patterning in <i>Drosophila</i> to BMP dorsal-ventral axis patterning in <i>Xenopus</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Eldar et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Kondo and Miura, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Spirov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Tucker et al., 2008</a>). In plants, traditional morphogens have yet to be observed, although it has been argued that the phytohormone auxin acts as an atypical morphogen that is actively transported to regulate plant morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bhalerao and Bennett, 2003</a>)."

In these cases, it is not known how identical cells become slightly different from their neighbors to initiate the patterning process. Theoretical approaches suggest a role for small differences of key transcriptional regulators, generated for example by stochastic fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib23\">Collier et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">H\u00fclskamp and Schnittger, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">H\u00fclskamp, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Meinhardt and Gierer, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Turing, 1952</a>). In these models, subtle initial differences between identical neighboring cells in activators and inhibitors are amplified and solidified through regulatory feedback loops and cell-to-cell communication to establish different cell fates (<a href=\"#bib55\">Kondo and Miura, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Meyer and Roeder, 2014</a>). For instance, in a computational model of lateral inhibition where Notch and Delta mutually inhibit one another in the same cell, small stochastic changes in Notch or Delta can flip a switch between cell identities (<a href=\"#bib90\">Sprinzak et al., 2010</a>). Subtle concentration changes in Notch or Delta may change a cell\u2019s signaling ability and either push cells into a sending state (i.e. high Delta/low Notch) or a receiving state (i.e. high Notch/low Delta). These changes subsequently are amplified through cell-to-cell Notch-Delta signaling to create ordered patterns (<a href=\"#bib23\">Collier et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Formosa-Jordan and Iba\u00f1es, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Sprinzak et al., 2010</a>). While manipulating Notch-Delta levels in individual mammalian cells supports this model (<a href=\"#bib63\">Matsuda et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Sprinzak et al., 2010</a>), these dynamic fluctuations are difficult to detect during tissue patterning within a multicellular system. A similar lateral inhibition model has been proposed to explain trichome (i.e. hair cell) spacing in plants (<a href=\"#bib26\">Digiuni et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">H\u00fclskamp and Schnittger, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">H\u00fclskamp, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Meinhardt and Gierer, 1974</a>). In these trichome models, initially identical cells can acquire subtle differences through brief stochastic fluctuations of transcriptional activators. These activators amplify both their own expression and the expression of faster-diffusing transcriptional repressors that move to the neighboring cell to create a non-random distribution of trichomes, following a Turing-like model (<a href=\"#bib47\">H\u00fclskamp, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Meinhardt and Gierer, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Turing, 1952</a>). Several transcriptional regulators needed for trichome patterning have been identified that support this model (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bouyer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Greese et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">H\u00fclskamp and Schnittger, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">H\u00fclskamp, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Schellmann et al., 2002</a>). However, the stochastic fluctuations of these genes remain to be observed <i>in vivo</i> during trichome development."

However, a few studies have demonstrated the importance of stochasticity in creating the correct distribution of phenotypes within a population of cells. For instance, during <i>Drosophila</i> retinal development, the transcriptional regulator <i>spineless</i> stochastically turns on or off to generate a proportional but randomly distributed population of photoreceptor subtypes (~30% ultraviolet/blue sensitive and\u00a0~70% ultraviolet/green sensitive; <a href=\"#bib104\">Wernet et al., 2006</a>). Without the stochastic dynamics of <i>spineless</i> expression, all cells adopt the same fate (<a href=\"#bib104\">Wernet et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Johnston and Desplan, 2014</a>). Similarly, a stochastic Markov model illustrates how a tumor can maintain phenotypic equilibrium between different cancer cell subpopulations. In this model, isolated cancer subpopulations will return to their respective proportions over time through stochastic interconversions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Gupta et al., 2011</a>). These studies suggest that stochasticity can help different cell populations to reach or maintain the correct phenotypic equilibrium."

The sepal is a useful model system because the giant cell patterning process can be live imaged from the earliest stages of initiation through giant cell differentiation. At maturity, giant cells are approximately one-fifth the length of the sepal and form when an epidermal cell undergoes multiple rounds of endoreduplication, an alternative cell cycle in which a cell replicates its DNA without undergoing mitotic division (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013G</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Roeder et al., 2010</a>). Mature sepals typically contain the same proportion of giant cells relative to small cells, although their spatial distribution varies from sepal to sepal and giant cells may even form adjacent to one another (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013F</a>). The correct proportion of giant cells and small cells is needed to control the curvature of the sepal; when the proportion of giant cells is altered, sepals are unable to enclose and protect the developing floral organs (<a href=\"#bib76\">Roeder et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib77\">2012</a>).

Since giant cells endoreduplicate (16\u201332C in ploidy; <a href=\"#bib76\">Roeder et al., 2010</a>), we tested whether ATML1 overexpression also induced endoreduplication. As expected, the proportion of highly endoreduplicated epidermal nuclei from <i>ATML1</i> overexpression line sepals increased (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>, red bars). These sepals contained a greater proportion of 16C and 32C giant cells than wild type, and on occasion a few cells even underwent an additional endocycle (64C; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>, red bars). In addition, we have previously demonstrated that giant and small epidermal cells can be distinguished with two molecular markers (<a href=\"#bib77\">Roeder et al., 2012</a>). To test whether our <i>ATML1</i> overexpression line sepals confer giant cell identity, we crossed them with plants expressing the giant and small cell markers. In these crossed sepals, the giant cell marker was expressed in almost every epidermal cell and the small cell marker was expressed only in a few remaining small cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J and K</a>). To validate that ATML1 alone is sufficient to drive giant cell formation, we induced <i>ATML1</i> expression in inflorescences using an ATML1 estradiol-inducible line. Ectopic giant cells formed on the sepal five days after being treated with 10 \u00b5M estradiol (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Overall, these results suggest that high levels of ATML1 are sufficient to induce sepal epidermal cells to adopt giant cell identity and can force a deterministic all-giant cell pattern."

We altered levels of <i>ATML1</i> genetically to test whether that would change the proportion of giant cells in the sepal epidermis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013F</a>). First, we reduced levels of ectopic <i>ATML1</i> expression by crossing our <i>ATML1</i> overexpression line with wild-type plants, resulting in plants containing only one copy of the <i>ATML1</i> overexpression transgene. These hemizygous plants formed ectopic giant cells, but fewer than the homozygous overexpression lines, and had more small cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To reduce ectopic <i>ATML1</i> levels further, we crossed <i>ATML1</i> overexpression hemizygotes into an <i>atml1\u20133</i> mutant background, removing endogenous <i>ATML1</i> expression. This resulted in plants with even fewer ectopic giant cells and more small cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To test dosage dependency further, we examined <i>atml1\u20133</i> heterozygous mutant plants. These plants had fewer giant cells than WT but more than <i>atm1\u20133</i> homozygous mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E and F</a>). We verified through qPCR that inflorescences from each of these <i>ATML1</i> dosage genotypes expressed different amounts of <i>ATML1</i> as expected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Additionally, we used flow cytometry to quantify endoreduplication and semi-automated image processing to measure cell size (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H and I</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Cunha et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Roeder et al., 2010</a>). Each dosage genotype exhibited proportional changes in ploidy and cell size. Together, these results suggest that <i>ATML1</i> influences giant cell formation in a dosage-dependent manner, where the amount of <i>ATML1</i> expressed will determine the proportion of giant cells that form in the sepal."

Furthermore, moderate overexpression of <i>ATML1</i> prompts only some cells to become giant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013F</a>), suggesting that either cells exhibited varying responses to the same ATML1 concentration or that ATML1 concentrations varied between cells. To quantify ATML1 levels in individual cells during sepal development and distinguish between these possibilities, we created a mCitrine-ATML1 fusion protein reporter (<i>pATML1::mCitrine-ATML1</i>) and transformed it into <i>atml1\u20133</i> mutant plants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This reporter expresses mCitrine-ATML1 under the putative native <i>ATML1</i> promoter and 3\u2019 UTR. We recovered two independent transgenic lines that fully rescue the <i>atml1\u20133</i> loss-of-giant cell mutant phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>; Materials and methods). Both lines exhibited similar behavior, thus we focused our analysis on one of them.

We observed that in the developing sepal, mean normalized mCitrine-ATML1 concentrations differ between individual nuclei (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013J</a>; sepals show a mean coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 0.2). Conversely in the floral meristem, which does not form giant cells, mCitrine-ATML1 concentrations are more uniform (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013F and I\u2013J</a>; meristems show a mean CV of approximately 0.1). In particular, we can see that although unimodal, the distribution of ATML1 concentrations in individual nuclei is broader in the sepal than in the meristem, both for lower and higher values (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). This suggests that ATML1 concentration behaves differently depending on the developmental context. To see whether other genes also exhibit variable expression similarly to mCitrine-ATML1 in the developing sepal nuclei, we measured the expression of two fluorescently-tagged transcription factors, VIP1-mCitrine (<i>pVIP1::VIP1-mCitrine</i>) and AP2-2XYpet (<i>pAP2::AP2-2XYpet</i>), and the <i>SEC24A</i> transcriptional reporter (<i>pSEC24A::H2B-GFP</i>).

SEC24A is a ubiquitously expressed CopII vesicle-coat protein that is involved in vesicle trafficking from the ER to the Golgi and has been previously reported to influence giant cell formation on the sepal (<a href=\"#bib73\">Qu et al., 2014</a>).

We observed that cells that eventually become giant generally exhibit fluctuations reaching higher concentrations of mCitrine-ATML1 before endoreduplication initiates than cells that mitotically divide. However, we observed high fluctuations in some cells that divided to become small cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">3C</a>). To quantitatively determine whether there was an ATML1 concentration threshold that could discriminate between cells that would become giant or cells that would remain small, we assessed how well mCitrine-ATML1 concentration peaks in each cell lineage were able to discriminate between giant cell and small cell fate. To do this, we measured the peak concentration of mCitrine-ATML1 in cells that either go on to divide (small) or endoreduplicate (giant) and performed a receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis using these two classes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and E</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1D and E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">2D and E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">3D and E</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chao et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Schr\u00f6ter et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Teles et al., 2013</a>). In this type of analysis, the ratio of correctly and incorrectly classified cells (i.e. the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR)) is calculated for a varying threshold value, providing a characteristic curve. The area under this curve (AUC) provides a measure of accuracy for predicting cell fate based on ATML1 concentration peaks (1 being perfect and 0.5 no better than random classification). We observed an average AUC of 0.74 in our different datasets, highlighting the predictive power of ATML1 concentration peaks in discriminating small versus giant cell fate (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.76, 0.69, 0.73, 0.78; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">3E</a>). Additionally, for each case we were then able to infer an optimum ATML1 concentration threshold that provides maximum separation between the cells that become giant and cells that remain small, i.e. the concentration value that maximizes the difference between TPR and FPR. We considered this threshold to be indicative of the ATML1 concentration required to trigger endoreduplication for the majority of cells in a given sepal."

It has been previously demonstrated that in <i>Arabidopsis</i> there is a linear correlation between nuclear size and cell ploidy (<a href=\"#bib51\">Jovtchev et al., 2006</a>). Using our live imaging data, we therefore characterized cell cycle stages by ploidy at each time point, using nuclear size as a proxy, where 2C is associated with cells being in G1 and 4C is associated with cells being in G2 (See <a href=\"#B2\">Box 2</a> and Material and methods for ploidy determination). Next, we compared peak concentration levels of mCitrine-ATML1 in individual cell lineages during both the 2C and 4C ploidy states of the cell cycle immediately before entry into either mitosis or endoreduplication (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013I</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1F\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">2F\u2013I</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">3F\u2013I</a>).

We used nuclear area as a proxy for defining cell cycle stage since nuclear area and ploidy have previously been described to be linearly correlated in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Jovtchev et al., 2006</a>). To confirm this correlation in our sepals, we stained nuclei with DAPI (a chromatin stain previously used to determine ploidy, [<a href=\"#bib51\">Jovtchev et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Roeder et al., 2010</a>]) and subsequently measured nuclear area using ImageJ. We found that there is a linear correlation between nuclear area and ploidy, where nuclear area increases as the cell progresses through the cell cycle, and we could locate discrete area cutoffs that accurately separate different cell cycle stages (2C\u00a0=\u00a0G1, 4C\u00a0=\u00a0G2; <a href=\"#B2-fig1\">Box 2\u2014Figure 1A</a>). Therefore, we propose that this method can in principle be applied to any system in which ploidy has been verified to be linearly correlated with nuclear area."

For our <i>pATML1::mCitrine-ATML1 atml1\u20133</i> transgenic line, nuclei with an area of\u00a0&lt;35 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> were classified as 2C (G1), nuclei with an area of\u00a0\u226535 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> with an eccentricity of\u00a0\u22640.7 were classified as 4C (G2) and nuclei with an area of\u00a0&gt;35 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> with an eccentricity of\u00a0&gt;0.7 were classified as 8C (endoreduplicating). Nuclei that bordered these area thresholds were manually checked to ensure that they were correctly classified, with a small number of incorrectly classified nuclei being reclassified. Manual correction was based on additional knowledge from the live imaging time series and visualization in 3D (e.g. the existence of incorrect transitions such as 2C to 8C or 8C to 2C, known not to happen in normal sepal development). Importantly, information of ATML1 concentration values was not used for ploidy classification at any stage. Additionally, independent manual correction of ploidy classification by different researchers produced highly similar results. For other genotypes (i.e. <i>pATML1::mCitrine-ATML atml1\u20133 lgo-2</i>, <i>pPDF1::GFP-ATML1</i>), area and eccentricity threshold values were slightly adjusted in order to account for changes in segmentation parameters (Materials and methods). Flowers that have a broader distribution of giant and small cells tended to have slightly inflated segmented masks in order to increase the number of nuclei successfully segmented through the entire time course. The inflation of the segmented masks leads to slightly increased nuclear area, which we accounted for when we defined the thresholds."

Since very few cells divide in our <i>pPDF1::GFP-ATML1</i> sepals, we could not directly infer this threshold through ROC analysis from this data as before. Therefore, we derived a common ATML1 concentration threshold from the live imaging data of our <i>pATML1::mCitrine-ATML1; atml1\u20133</i> flowers (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), by performing ROC analysis using mean normalized ATML1 concentrations for each flower (see Materials and methods for details). Applying this threshold to the <i>pPDF1::GFP-ATML1</i> data, we observed that almost all endoreduplicating cells exhibited high peak levels of GFP-ATML1 in G2, above the common threshold (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013J</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1C\u2013F;</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">2C\u2013F</a>). This is in contrast to wild type, where fewer cells reach the ATML1 concentration threshold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Combined, these data suggest that our overexpression line follows the same threshold-based cell-autonomous fluctuation patterning mechanism; the increased basal <i>GFP-ATML1</i> expression from the <i>PDF1</i> promoter raises ATML1 production levels such that almost all sepal epidermal cells surpass the giant cell fate-inducing threshold during G2."

In this scenario, we would expect the same number of <i>lgo-2</i> nuclei to surpass the ATML1 threshold in G2 as in wild type. Cells that pass the threshold would still divide because they are unable to endoreduplicate. To test this, we live imaged our mCitrine-ATML1 reporter in the <i>lgo-2</i> mutant background (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2A</a>; <a href=\"#media8\">Videos 8</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">9</a> and <a href=\"#media10\">10</a>). These plants still exhibited mCitrine-ATML1 fluctuations, suggesting that ATML1 fluctuates independently of LGO (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,E\u2013J</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1B\u2013F;</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2B\u2013F</a>). We applied the common ATML1 concentration threshold derived from <i>pATML1::mCitrine-ATML1; atml1\u20133</i> flowers (see previous section; <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>) to predict the number of giant cells that would have formed exclusively based on the threshold mechanism (ATML1 concentration peaks above threshold during G2; Materials and methods). We found no significant differences between the predicted number of giant cells in the <i>lgo-2</i> mutant and the observed number of giant cells in wild type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1C\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2C\u2013D</a>). This suggests that a cell may still fluctuate to high levels of ATML1 in G2 but without LGO, cells cannot respond to these fluctuations to trigger endoreduplication. Since the absence of LGO does not seem to change the dynamics of ATML1, this result further indicates that ATML1 fluctuations are independent of endoreduplication."

We therefore asked whether a simple computational model that exhibits cell-autonomous stochastic fluctuations of ATML1 is sufficient to recapitulate giant cell patterning as observed in our experimental data. In our model, we implemented a simplified regulatory network, where ATML1 stochastically fluctuates in a growing tissue (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a>; Materials and methods). In this model, we assume that in every cell there is a basal amount of ATML1 being produced as well as an amount being linearly degraded. In addition, we tested the possibility that ATML1 engages in a self-catalytic feedback loop, as ATML1 has a putative ATML1 binding site in its own promoter and ATML1 has been shown to bind this motif <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abe et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Takada and J\u00fcrgens, 2007</a>). Additionally, in seedlings induction of ectopic ATML1 activity for seven days shows an increase of endogenous ATML1 expression 1.5 to two fold, hinting at the possibility of a feedback loop (<a href=\"#bib93\">Takada et al., 2013</a>)."

Top panel shows the proposed ATML1 model network in which ATML1 can prevent cell division and instead drive entry into endoreduplication and giant cell specification. Middle panel shows a cartoon of the cell cycle timer time course. When the timer exceeds a first threshold level <i>\u0398<sub>C,S</sub></i>, cells enter into the G2 phase and increase their ploidy to 4C. When the timer reaches a second threshold level, <i>\u0398<sub>C,D</sub></i>, cells divide, unless their target levels have surpassed the threshold <i>\u0398<sub>T</sub></i> sometime during G2 phase. Bottom panel shows a scatter plot cartoon illustrating how a \u2018hard threshold\u2019 in the target levels results in a \u2018soft threshold\u2019 in ATML1. We refer to a hard threshold when levels right above or below the threshold will result in two different outcomes. If the target perfectly followed the dynamics of ATML1, its upstream regulator, and obeyed a deterministic dynamics, all cells that cross the target threshold <i>\u0398<sub>T</sub></i> would also cross a corresponding hard ATML1 threshold. Hence, a hard threshold in the target would be effectively encoded as a hard threshold on its upstream regulator ATML1. In contrast, in our model, the target has a finite degradation rate, and stochastic dynamics, so that it is not a perfect follower of ATML1 dynamics; thus, a hard threshold in target levels (vertical red dashed line) results in a soft threshold in ATML1 (horizontal red dashed line). A cell close to the ATML1 soft threshold may or may not pass the target threshold and endoreduplicate to become a giant cell. Dots in the bottom panel is a cartoon of the ATML1 maxima of simulated cell lineages, with red dots indicating cells that become giant, while blue dots represent mitotically dividing small cells.

Dot colors in the coarse-grained time course panels represent the ploidy, following the color code in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, while the line color refers in this case to the cell type at the end of the simulation, being orange for giant cells and blue for the small dividing cells. Horizontal red lines in the ATML1 panels represent the predicted soft threshold <i>\u0398<sub>A</sub><sup>*</sup></i> and the red shaded region is a measure of its error (Materials and methods). The other horizontal lines in the target and timer variables show the different thresholds set in the simulations. Coarse-grained time courses show we may lose some ATML1 peaks due to the lower time resolution, and this might slightly decrease the levels of the predicted threshold with respect to the threshold predicted from traces with higher time resolution. Cells with ATML1 levels reaching the predicted soft threshold in G2 are likely to have the corresponding downstream target levels above the target threshold, driving endoreduplication (see <b>A</b>). However, ATML1 may even cross the predicted soft threshold, and still not drive giant cell endoreduplication, if the target does not cross its own threshold (see <b>C</b> middle and right). On the other side, cells being close to but not reaching the ATML1 threshold might endoreduplicate, provided that the target crosses its corresponding threshold (<b>C</b> left, middle).

Simulations with different feedback strengths and different ATML1 basal production rates that lead to similar percentages of giant cells in the tissue (7 to 9%) are shown. Histograms of ATML1 concentrations (left), ATML1 time traces for cells becoming giant cells (middle left), ROC analysis (middle right) and percentages of cells with the different ploidies. Boxplots are obtained from five simulations with different initial conditions (middle right and right panels). The stronger is the feedback, the higher is the CV for the ATML1 concentrations. No feedback or a weak feedback give rise to a unimodal distribution of ATML1 concentrations (<b>A\u2013C</b>), while a stronger feedback can give rise to a bimodal distribution (<b>D</b>). For no feedback (<b>A</b>) or weaker feedback (<b>B</b>), small and fast fluctuations drive the singling out of cells for endoreduplication. Stronger feedback strengths make larger fluctuations appear, whose time-scales are larger (<b>C\u2013D</b>). This makes the ATML1 peak levels at 2C equivalent to 4C levels. In these cases, the AUC values are also high at 2C, which does not correspond to the experimental data. Similar fractions of giant cells are produced by all four induction strengths (<b>A\u2013D</b>). Color codes of the time traces are as in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>.

(<b>E\u2013F</b>) QPCR results testing feedback strength of ATML1 induction on endogenous <i>ATML1</i> 48 hr after application of 10 \u00b5M, 1 \u00b5M or 0.1 \u00b5M estradiol (inducing agent) compared to mock treated inflorescences. Endogenous <i>ATML1</i> transcript levels increase approximately 1.5-fold within 48 hr after ATML1 is induced with 10 \u00b5M estradiol as compared to mock-treated plants. To put this fold change in context, we examined the 10 \u00b5M estradiol induction of other genes downstream of ATML1 including <i>CER5</i> (2.3-fold), <i>FDH</i> (1.6-fold), <i>PDF2</i> (1.5-fold) and <i>PDF1</i> (1.2-fold). Note that these downstream genes are induced with very similar fold changes as the endogenous <i>ATML1. CER5</i>, <i>FDH</i>, and <i>PDF1</i> do not encode transcription factors and therefore cannot act in a feedback loop. This suggests that the feedback of ATML1 on itself is not activating ATML1 further than other targets at the 48 hr time point. The transgene was induced about 700-fold by 10 \u00b5M estradiol (<b>F</b>). Induction with 0.1 \u00b5M or 1 \u00b5M estradiol produced intermediate levels of induction and activation of downstream genes, also consistent with a weak positive feedback loop.

Therefore, to induce endoreduplication, ATML1 likely directly or indirectly regulates the expression of a downstream cell cycle regulator (e.g. cyclin/CDK/cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor). We therefore assigned ATML1 to activate a downstream target that inhibits cell division and promotes entry into endoreduplication. Only if the downstream target passes its own specific threshold in G2, does it successfully drive a cell to endoreduplicate to form a giant cell (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Hence, we expect a few cells to divide even if their ATML1 concentrations go above the threshold because the target\u2019s threshold is not reached. This is consistent with our live imaging data, where in some cases mCitrine-ATML1 concentrations exceed the giant cell threshold in 4C but the cells go on to divide (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2N</a>). Furthermore, we expect that a few giant cells will form when ATML1 approaches but does not exceed the threshold because the target stochastically passes its own threshold (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Our model however deviates from the French flag model because it utilizes internal fluctuations instead of a diffusible morphogen to generate concentration differences. Concentration threshold-based patterning mechanisms have been traditionally viewed as being non-robust because they are sensitive to small perturbations in concentrations. Often additional mechanisms are needed to achieve robustness (<a href=\"#bib27\">Eldar et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Kondo and Miura, 2010</a>). This sensitivity to small changes in concentration is consistent with our results in the sepal, where giant cell formation is highly responsive to changes in the basal production of ATML1. Interestingly however, in wild-type plants, the number of giant cells varies only slightly from sepal to sepal, falling within a small range (10-30). This indicates that these fluctuations together with a threshold must be tuned to ensure that the correct proportion of giant cells form on the sepal. Our data suggests that the cell cycle acts as a stabilizing factor to restrict giant cell fate decisions similarly to secondary mechanisms used in other biological systems."

However, these studies suggest that G1 is the critical phase for specification. During G1, there is a growth factor-dependent restriction point, where a cell determines whether to enter quiescence (G0) or progress through the cell cycle. Cyclin/Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK) activity is normally reduced during the restriction point, providing a window for cells to receive extracellular signals necessary for cell fate decisions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Blagosklonny and Pardee, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Blagosklonny et al., 2002</a>). This has been nicely demonstrated in human embryonic stem cells, where a stem cell\u2019s ability to differentiate into an endodermal cell is dependent upon receiving TGF-\u03b2-Smad2/3 signals during this restriction point in early G1, when CyclinD levels are low (<a href=\"#bib71\">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</a>). In addition to transient Cyclin/CDK expression, some studies have found that cells extend their G1 phase immediately before differentiation. This may allow cell fate inducing factors to reach sufficient levels to induce differentiation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Calegari et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Collart et al., 2013</a>). How G1 lengthening occurs is still under debate. However, one recent study showed that increasing a cell\u2019s nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio dilutes the concentration of DNA replication factors which results in a prolonged G1 phase (<a href=\"#bib22\">Collart et al., 2013</a>). Additionally, Singh et al. showed that chromatin changes associated with the M-G1 transition cause transcriptional leakiness of many prodifferentiation genes, which prime cells to respond to cellular differentiation signals (<a href=\"#bib87\">Singh et al., 2013</a>)."

For instance, cell fate decisions governed by the G1 phase of the cell cycle must often receive an extracellular signal to activate prodifferentiation genes instead of going into G0 quiescence. In contrast, our model suggests ATML1 fluctuations could be sufficient to pattern the sepal without a need for an extracellular signal. Alternatively, ATML1 could be priming the cell to receive a signal during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. We have previously reported that ACR4 (a transmembrane receptor kinase; <a href=\"#bib34\">Gifford et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Watanabe et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Roeder et al., 2012</a>) and DEK1 (a transmembrane calpain protease; <a href=\"#bib57\">Liang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Lid et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib59\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Roeder et al., 2012</a>) act in the giant cell formation pathway, suggesting that intercellular signaling may assist in promoting giant cell fate decisions. An epistasis analysis between ACR4, DEK1 and ATML1 reveals that during giant cell formation, ACR4 acts upstream of ATML1 but that DEK1 acts downstream (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results are in opposition to what has been previously published about these genes during embryogenesis, where DEK1 acts upstream of ATML1 and ACR4 acts downstream (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abe et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Gifford et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Johnson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">San-Bento et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Takada et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Tanaka et al., 2002</a>). One possibility for these results is that ACR4 and DEK1 may act together with ATML1 in a feedback loop (<a href=\"#bib33\">Galletti and Ingram, 2015</a>). As previously discussed (see Introduction), computational models propose that in tissues where no localized signals are present, stochastic fluctuations of transcriptional regulators create subtle differences between identical cells which initiate feedback loops including intercellular signaling to create the pattern (<a href=\"#bib65\">Meyer and Roeder, 2014</a>). While our current model suggests that giant cell fate can be predicted through cell autonomous mechanisms, it will be interesting to see if ACR4 and DEK1 act to help establish or maintain giant cell fate or to propagate giant cell patterning in the developing sepal."

It is not yet exactly understood how CDK inhibitors like LGO function in promoting endoreduplication because some evidence suggests that they interact with cyclin-CDK complexes during both G1-S and G2-M transitions, while other studies suggest specificity for G2-M (<a href=\"#bib13\">Boudolf et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Churchman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Kumar et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Van Leene et al., 2010</a>).

Although Pax6 behaves similarly to ATML1 through controlling cell fate in a dosage dependent manner, <i>Pax6</i> expression remains relatively constant in neurogenic progenitor cells until the G2/M phase. This indicates that Pax6 does not undergo random fluctuations like ATML1, but is likely regulated by an upstream factor. Other examples of G2 mediated cell fate decisions include the development of secondary vulval precursor cells, where precursor cells require high levels of LIN-12 mediated signaling during G2 to commit to secondary cell fates (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ambros, 1999</a>), and <i>Drosophila</i> mechanosensory precursor cells, where cells enter a temporary quiescence in G2 to provide a small window for proneural determinant gene products to accumulate (<a href=\"#bib68\">N\u00e8gre et al., 2003</a>).

Denoised images were imported into MorphoGraphX (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015</a>) in order to produce binary masks for individual sepal nuclei while simultaneously removing non\u2013relevant meristematic and border cell nuclei (parameters: brighten/darken: 1\u20134; Gaussian Blur: 0.3\u20131; Binarize: 5000\u20138000). Since different genotypes show different proportions of giant and small cells, and segmentation parameters are globally applied to the whole tissue, slight adjustments were made for each genotype in order to fit the binary masks as well as possible to all nuclei across all genotypes. For each individual time course, parameter values were kept constant for all time points. Binary mask images were used as input for the final nuclear segmentation, performed with the Costanza (COnfocal STack ANalyZer Application ImageJ plugin (<a href=\"http://www.plant-image-analysis.org/software/costanza\">http://www.plant-image-analysis.org/software/costanza</a>).

To track the cell nuclei between two successive nuclei segmentations, <i>N<sub>t</sub>\u00a0</i>and <i>N<sub>t+\u0394t</sub></i> (where <i>\u0394t</i> corresponds to the time interval between two consecutive acquisitions), the block matching framework (<a href=\"#bib66\">Michelin et al., 2016</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">Commowick et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Ourselin et al., 2000</a>) was used to non-linearly register the corresponding denoised images, <i>I<sub>t</sub>\u00a0</i>and <i>I<sub>t+\u0394t,</sub></i> (floating and reference images respectively). The registered floating image and the reference image were merged with different colors into a double channel image in ImageJ (<a href=\"#B1\">Box 1</a>, 3D projection of the merged image, red: reference image, green: registered floating image).

Given the spatial complexity of the tissue and the large time interval between consecutive images (<i>\u0394t</i>=8 hr), registration was not always successful for all nuclei.

We did not use a secondary nuclear marker to detect nuclear size because mCitrine-ATML1 levels are low and may experience bleed through from a nuclear marker in a different channel. Additionally, given imaging artifacts observed when using three-dimensional images, which include extension of nuclei in the Z-axis, we chose to perform quantification in two-dimensional images, in order to maximize result accuracy. Two-dimensional nuclei were obtained by scanning, for each nucleus, through each individual Z slice of the Costanza-segmented images and selecting the slice with the largest area, where segmentation is most accurate. For all 2D nuclei, shape parameters such as eccentricity were quantified using the <i>regionprops</i> function in the MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox, which was also used to quantify areas. For each 2D nucleus, absolute fluorescence intensity was quantified by summing intensity of all pixels in the respective region of the raw intensity image. Both absolute intensity and area were corrected for possible magnification changes during the time course by taking into account pixel sizes, and concentrations were calculated based on the corrected absolute intensity and area values. ATML1 concentration, area and eccentricity plots for all cells in the time course were generated with custom functions that make use of the corrected parental correspondence information. From the complete set of tracked lineages, we selected for lineages that exhibited high quality segmentation and tracking data that allowed us to follow a given cell either until the last point of the time course, or a until fate became apparent (division or endoreduplication; see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplemental file 1</a> for examples)."

Threshold values of the timer for the synthesis phase and division checkpoint (<i>\u0398<sub>C,S</sub></i> and <i>\u0398<sub>C,D</sub></i> respectively) were assigned so that we could recover 2C and 4C percentages of cells in <i>atml1\u20133</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>) in regions of the parameter space in which no giant cells were formed. Given the chosen timer threshold values and an arbitrary basal timer production rate, simulations were integrated throughout 105 arbitrary time units, so that cells could undergo around three cell cycles (<a href=\"#bib76\">Roeder et al., 2010</a>). Simulations scanning the parameter space were performed by using logarithmic spaced values of the ATML1 basal production rate (<i>P<sub>A</sub></i>) and linearly spaced values of the ATML1 auto-induction production rate (<i>V<sub>A</sub></i>). Specifically, we performed simulations on 121 logarithmically spaced <i>P<sub>A</sub></i> values between 0 and 2.2, and 11 linearly spaced <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> values between 0 and 2.5. From these parameter scans, <i>P<sub>A</sub></i> and <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> parameters were chosen for the simulations shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>. <i>P<sub>A</sub></i> and <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> parameter values for representing the wild-type sepal in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> were chosen so that there was a unimodal distribution of ATML1 concentration with similar CVs to the experimental CVs, giving rise to the same number of giant cells found in developing sepals. In particular, we aimed to have sepals that developed a total of 30 giant cells with 8C and higher ploidy, with approximately 17 of those cells being 16C and higher ploidies (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). To ensure that the target approximately followed and mimicked the dynamics of ATML1, we simulated a target with a higher degradation rate than ATML1 itself. To grow the sepal in a realistic manner, we provided a certain degree of anisotropy on the tissue growth parameters, as previously reported experimentally (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hervieux et al., 2016</a>)."

Using the <i>Arabidopsis</i> sepal, an organ with a stereotyped size and shape and an epidermis consisting of several cell types, the authors use live cell imaging and modeling to investigate how the pattern of giant cells (GC) arises. The authors provide evidence that stochastic gene expression, a widespread phenomenon that arises from the nature of gene expression as it responds to intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variation, enables equivalent cells to adopt fates different from some of their neighbors, dependent upon cell-autonomous accumulation of a particular key regulator. In this manuscript the authors present a case for ATML1 being such a factor, whose activity in promoting GC fate is determined by stochastic levels that exceed a threshold."

Overexpression of ATML1 in internal tissues is seedling lethal (Peterson et al., 2013; Takada et al., 2013). Since cell cycle genes are expressed in dividing cells in all cell layers at all stages of development, expressing ATML1 under one of these promoters would cause lethality. In addition, while there are well characterized combinations of promoters and degradation elements that can give rise to expression in S through early G2 and late G2 through M phase, there are currently no equivalently characterized promoters and degradation elements for G1 in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (Yin et al., 2014)."

We are doing this in place of the experiment proposed (mutating the ATML1 binding site in the ATML1 promoter) because while one ATML1 binding site has been characterized in the ATML1 promoter (Takada and J\u00fcrgens, 2007), there may be additional ATML1 binding sites within the promoter according to our searches with the ATML1 consensus binding sequences (Abe et al., 2001; Nakamura et al., 2006). This would make the deletion experiment difficult to interpret. Using the inducible system, we found that ATML1 works in a weak positive feedback loop as predicted by the model; endogenous ATML1 expression increased by 1.7 fold when ATML1 was induced with estradiol for 24 hours in inflorescences (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4E-F</a>)."

To put this fold change in context, we examined the induction of other genes downstream of ATML1 including <i>CER5</i> (2.3-fold), <i>FDH</i> (1.6-fold), <i>PDF2</i> (1.5-fold) and <i>PDF1</i> (1.2-fold) (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4E-F</a>). Note that these downstream genes are induced with very similar fold changes as the endogenous <i>ATML1. CER5, FDH</i>, and <i>PDF1</i> do not encode transcription factors and therefore cannot act in a feedback loop. This suggests that the feedback of ATML1 on itself is not activating ATML1 further than other targets at the 48-hour time point. To further test the induction, we also induced with 0.1 \u00b5M or 1 \u00b5M estradiol and achieved intermediate levels of induction and activation of downstream genes."

By increasing the ratio between the basal and the ATML1-dependent production rates (<i>P<sub>A</sub></i> and <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> in the model), the model dynamics changes from having a single \u2018low\u2019 fixed-point (no to weak feedback), to a bistability region (strong feedback). We note that if the feedback strength was increased further you could be left with a single \u2018high\u2019 fixed point, but we do not consider this regime in the paper as this could not fit the experimental data. By definition the parameters chosen for the strong feedback cases in the simulations were in the bistability region (or at its boundary), leading to a long-tailed or bimodal distribution of ATML1 expression (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4C-D</a>), which we do not observe experimentally (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). Our experimentally observed gradual increase in induced <i>ATML1</i> with increasing levels of estradiol further support the case for weak feedback in the system, as endogenous <i>ATML1</i> levels are not sensitive to small increases in exogenous <i>ATML1</i>. In the strong feedback case, sensitivity to <i>ATML1</i> induction increases as the system is bistable and easily reaches the high value state."

We found that <i>ATML1</i> induction with 10 \u00b5M estradiol lead to total <i>ATML1</i> levels 7.1 times higher than the mock treated samples, and increased endogenous <i>ATML1</i> expression 1.5-fold within 48 hours (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4E-F</a>).
