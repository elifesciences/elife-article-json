We identified a mouse mutant with accelerated aging in the retina as well as pathologies observed in age-dependent retinal diseases, suggesting that the responsible gene regulates retinal aging, and its impairment results in age-dependent disease. We determined that a mutation in the transmembrane 135 (<i>Tmem135</i>) is responsible for these phenotypes. We observed localization of TMEM135 on mitochondria, and imbalance of mitochondrial fission and fusion in mutant <i>Tmem135</i> as well as <i>Tmem135</i> overexpressing cells, indicating that TMEM135 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Additionally, mutant retina showed higher sensitivity to oxidative stress. These results suggest that the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics through TMEM135 is critical for protection from environmental stress and controlling the progression of retinal aging. Our study identified TMEM135 as a critical link between aging and age-dependent diseases."

We identified a mouse mutant with accelerated aging in the retina as well as pathologies observed in age-dependent retinal diseases, suggesting that the responsible gene regulates retinal aging, and its impairment results in age-dependent disease. We determined that a mutation in the transmembrane 135 (<i>Tmem135</i>) is responsible for these phenotypes. We observed localization of TMEM135 on mitochondria, and imbalance of mitochondrial fission and fusion in mutant <i>Tmem135</i> as well as <i>Tmem135</i> overexpressing cells, indicating that TMEM135 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Additionally, mutant retina showed higher sensitivity to oxidative stress. These results suggest that the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics through TMEM135 is critical for protection from environmental stress and controlling the progression of retinal aging. Our study identified TMEM135 as a critical link between aging and age-dependent diseases."

To investigate the link between aging and age-dependent diseases, Lee et al. used mutant mice whose retina of the eye ages more quickly than normal mice and are prone to developing an eye condition that is similar to AMD. The experiments show that these mice have a mutation in a gene called <i>Tmem135</i> that is responsible for these visual problems. <i>Tmem135</i> regulates the size of cell compartments called mitochondria, which produce energy for the cell. This affects the ability of the mitochondria to work properly and makes the cells more sensitive to environmental stress, which in turn makes the retina age more quickly."

                        "text": "One explanation for why age-dependent diseases manifest themselves in an age-dependent manner is that disease-causing mechanisms interact with age-dependent cellular changes that normally occur in aging. The common phenomena observed in both aging and age-dependent diseases may provide clues to this interaction. For example, one of the major age-dependent changes that generally occur in the tissue is accumulation of damages caused by oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harman, 1956</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">1972a</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">1972b</a>). As by-products of normal cellular respiration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly generated in cells mainly in the mitochondria. When cellular production of ROS overwhelms its antioxidant capacity (state referred to as 'oxidative stress'), ROS damages cellular macromolecules such as lipids, protein, and DNA/RNA. In the course of aging, such damages caused by ROS are thought to accumulate and contribute to the development of age-dependent tissue dysfunctions. Increase in oxidative damage has been observed in a number of age-dependent diseases as well, and its involvement in the pathogenesis of these diseases has been widely suggested (<a href=\"#bib11\">Davies, 1995</a>). Related to the oxidative damage, another phenomenon that is observed in both aging and age-dependent diseases is the decline in mitochondrial function (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lenaz, 1998</a>). Mitochondria are the organelle that consumes over 90% of cellular oxygen and generates ROS (<a href=\"#bib21\">Harman, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Murphy, 2009</a>). Due to its proximity to the site of ROS generation, mitochondrial components are particularly susceptible to ROS-mediated oxidative damage (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cadenas and Davies, 2000</a>). Prolonged exposure to ROS during aging is thought to result in mitochondrial dysfunctions and significantly contribute to the development of pathologies associated with aging. There is also strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs early and acts causally in the pathogenesis of age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lin and Beal, 2006</a>). While these phenomena indicate some of the common aspects between aging and age-dependent diseases, the mechanisms linking these two processes have not been elucidated at the molecular level."

                        "text": "Given the complexity in both the aging process and age-dependent diseases, as well as countless variables (including genetic an environmental variables) that exist among human population, it is extremely challenging to study the mechanisms underlying the aging process and how they relate to the disease-causing mechanism in humans. An animal model that shows accelerated aging as well as age-dependent disease symptoms could provide a useful experimental system for this purpose. Furthermore, a forward genetics approach starting with an animal model with these symptoms offers a potential of identifying a responsible gene that is not previously known to be associated with the aging process nor age-dependent diseases. We isolated an N-ethy-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutant mouse line, <i>FUN025</i>, that exhibits age-dependent retinal abnormalities with a trajectory similar to that found with retinal aging observed in wild-type (WT) mice (<a href=\"#bib22\">Higuchi et al., 2015</a>) but with an early onset and faster progression. In addition, we found that the <i>FUN025</i> mutation leads to pathologies observed in age-dependent retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These phenotypes in <i>FUN025</i> mice suggest that the responsible gene is involved in regulating the rate of aging in the retina, and that its impairment leads to development of age-dependent disease. In this study, we identify a gene mutation that is responsible for retinal abnormalities in <i>FUN025</i> mice and characterize the novel molecular functions of this gene/protein associated with regulation of mitochondria as well as sensitivity to oxidative stress. Our findings reveal a molecular link between the aging process and age-dependent diseases, and a molecular mechanisms leading to age-dependent disease pathologies."

It has been shown that, in the WT retina, age-dependent abnormalities including retinal degeneration, increased number of ectopic synapses and increased retinal stress all start from the peripheral retina by 8 months of age on an aging-susceptible A/J background but later on a less susceptible B6 background, which progress to the central retina with age (<a href=\"#bib22\">Higuchi et al., 2015</a>). Histological analysis of homozygous <i>FUN025</i> mutant and C57BL/6J (B6) WT retina at two and seven months of age revealed that a decrease in the ONLT Index [the thickness of outer nuclear layer (ONL) normalized by the thickness of inner nuclear layer (INL)] in <i>FUN025</i> mice compared to WT mice is observed by two months of age and becomes more pronounced by seven months of age, indicating progressive loss of photoreceptor cells in the <i>FUN025</i> retina (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that, while most of the presynaptic photoreceptor terminals (PSD95, green) line up in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) in close opposition to the bipolar cell postsynaptic structures (PKC, red) in the WT retina, ectopic localization of presynaptic terminals and abnormal extension of bipolar cell dendrites into the ONL were observed in the <i>FUN025</i> retina (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Quantification of ectopic synapses indicated that a significantly increased number of ectopic synapses are observed in the peripheral retina of <i>FUN025</i> mice by two months of age, and in the central retina by seven months of age, indicating that this phenotype progresses from the peripheral to the central retina (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We also observed that the sign of retinal stress, up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Higuchi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lewis and Fisher, 2003</a>), was significantly increased in the peripheral retina of <i>FUN025</i> mice compared to the WT mice by two months of age, which later progresses toward the central retina (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Thus, <i>FUN025</i> retina exhibits age-dependent retinal abnormalities with a trajectory similar to that found with retinal aging observed in WT mice (<a href=\"#bib22\">Higuchi et al., 2015</a>) but with an early onset and faster progression."

                                "text": "We further investigated whether the early-onset and accelerated aging process in the <i>FUN025</i> retina is accompanied by pathologies observed in age-dependent diseases. Punctate light deposits were found in the fundus photography of the eyes from <i>FUN025</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), which may be due to the accumulation of autofluorescent cells and aggregates observed between photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These cells/aggregates and RPE exhibit autofluorescence detected using a DPS 561 laser (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>), which resembles that of lipofuscin, protein and lipid rich aggregates known to accumulate in aging tissues and suggested to be involved in age-dependent diseases such as AMD and Alzheimer's disease (<a href=\"#bib16\">Giaccone et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nowotny et al., 2014</a>). The hyper-autofluorescent aggregates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, arrowhead) resemble subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rudolf et al., 2008</a>), a type of extracellular lesion between the photoreceptors and RPE often observed in AMD patients (<a href=\"#bib10\">Curcio et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zweifel et al., 2010</a>). To determine the cell type of these autofluorescent cells, immunostaining was performed in 7-month old retinal sections. The subretinal autofluorescent cells were positive for a microglia marker, Iba1, and a macrophage marker, F4/80, in the <i>FUN025</i> retina (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells near the apical surface of the RPE have very few processes and show immunoreactivity to F4/80, suggesting that they have transformed from microglia to macrophages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These data also suggest that the RPE layer is the origin of stress, toward which the microglia migrate (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jonas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mcglade-Mcculloh et al., 1989</a>). Long-term, low-grade inflammation (innate immunity) has been widely postulated as a part of the aging process, and is also enhanced in many age-dependent diseases (<a href=\"#bib47\">Salminen et al., 2012</a>). To test if innate immunity is increased in <i>FUN025</i> mice, immunostaining was performed with an inflammasome marker, NLR Family, Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) and a functional caspase-1 subunit marker, caspase-1 p10 on retinal sections from seven-month old <i>FUN025</i> and WT mice. Immunoreactivity to both makers was increased in the neural retina as well as RPE of <i>FUN025</i> mice compared to WT mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), indicating elevated innate immunity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Franchi et al., 2009</a>). In addition, by seven months, the RPE (highlighted by anti-CRALBP antibody) is uniformly thickened in <i>FUN025</i> mice compared to that of controls while each RPE cell is still intact (the nuclei of RPE highlighted by anti-Otx1+Otx2 antibody) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Similar increases in innate immunity markers (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tarallo et al., 2012</a>) and thickness of RPE (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acton et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Karampelas et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zhao and Vollrath, 2011</a>) have been observed in AMD patients. To determine if early-onset of retinal aging as well as retinal pathologies observed in <i>FUN025</i> mice affect the ability of the retina to respond to light, we performed transcorneal electroretinograms (ERG) recordings from seven-month-old <i>FUN025</i> mice and their WT littermates. ERG data revealed significantly reduced scotopic (dark-adapted) a-wave and b-wave from the rod pathway, and a modest reduction in photopic (light-adapted) b-wave from the cone pathway in <i>FUN025</i> mice compared to WT controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) indicating impaired visual function in <i>FUN025</i> mice. In conclusion, <i>FUN025</i> mice provide a mouse model with accelerated aging process and age-dependent disease pathologies in the retina."

Genetic mapping of the <i>FUN025</i> mutation was performed using F2 intercrosses (C57BL6-<i>FUN025</i> x C57BR/cdJ and C57BL6-<i>FUN025</i> x 129S1/SvImJ) and genetic markers to distinguish between the alleles of <i>FUN025</i> (C57BL/6J) and C57BR/cdJ or 129S1/SvImJ (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The F2 mice were phenotyped by fundus\u00a0photography and histological analysis at 3 months. Genotype and phenotype data from 70 F2 mice generated a minimal genetic region flanked by SNPOlf294T&gt;C (93764448) and Rs31011252, containing 25 genes. Using a SureSelectXT custom library (Agilent Technologies), we performed a sequence capture array on <i>FUN025</i> genomic DNA followed by paired end sequencing. Standard bioinformatic analyses of our sequencing data revealed a point mutation (T&gt;C) in the splice-donor site adjacent to exon 12 of <i>Tmem135</i> in <i>FUN025</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). The consensus sequence of mouse splice donor sites depicts the necessity of the GT sequence at positions 1 and 2 downstream of the exon boundary for the functionality of the site (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carmel et al., 2004</a>). The mutation disrupts the splice donor site (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), resulting in skipping of exon 12 and a frame shift creating an early stop codon in <i>FUN025</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>). The probability of forming transmembrane helices predicted by the program TMHMM (v. 1.0) (<a href=\"http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/\">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/</a>) suggested that WT TMEM135 contains five transmembrane helices (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), while the 4th and 5th transmembrane helices are abolished and the orientation of the remaining 3 transmembrane helices in the membrane is reversed in mutant TMEM135 compared to WT TMEM135 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The c-terminal region of the mutant TMEM135 is also shorter due to the early stop codon (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,G</a>). Thus, the <i>FUN025</i> mutation in <i>Tmem135</i> which results in the shorter c-terminal region with amino acid sequence changes, predicted loss of two transmembrane helices and reversed orientation within the membrane likely impairs the normal functions of the TMEM135 protein. The TMEM135 antibody recognizing the N-terminus of TMEM135 protein detected the mutant TMEM135 protein in the <i>FUN025</i> brains as well as the WT TMEM135 protein in WT brains by western blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>)."

In order to elucidate the mechanistic role of TMEM135, we characterized the localization of the TMEM135 protein in cultured cells and mouse retina in vivo. Primary WT mouse fibroblast cells (MFs) were co-transfected with the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged vector containing <i>Tmem135</i> and DsRed2-tagged mitochondria vector (pDsRed2-Mito Vector, Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Immunofluorescence data showed that the GFP-TMEM135 protein displays an intracellular vesicular expression pattern in the cytoplasm, and a proportion is found in punctate structures on mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Colocalization of TMEM135 to mitochondria was further confirmed in WT MFs using an anti-TMEM135 antibody and an AcGFP1-tagged mitochondria vector (pAcGFP1-Mito Vector, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) as well as in WT MFs with anti-TMEM135 antibody and a red-fluorescent dye that stains mitochondria (MitoTracker Red CMXRos) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, upper panel). Notably, the proportion of TMEM135 signals tend to distribute to small foci along the surface of mitochondria, at mitochondrial constriction sites, and at the tips of individual mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), and there appears to be less colocolization of TMEM135 on mitochondria in <i>FUN025</i> MFs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, lower panel). Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that transfected GFP-TMEM135 localizes on the surface of mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Furthermore, colocalization of TMEM135 to mitochondria was observed in monkey kidney fibroblast-like cells (Cos-7) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) and mouse primary hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). The mitochondria fraction isolated from mouse brains showed TMEM135 signals by immunoblotting, also indicating that TMEM135 is associated with mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). In the retina from WT and <i>FUN025</i> mice, stronger TMEM135 signals were detected in the ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), inner segments of photoreceptor cells, and RPE, which colocalized with mitochondria labeled with anti-TOMM20 antibody (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). The colocalization of TMEM135 with mitochondria was also observed in the primary mouse RPE cell culture (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Similar to the observation in fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), less colocalization of TMEM135 with mitochondria was observed in <i>FUN025</i> RPE cells compared to WT RPE cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). In conclusion, a proportion of TMEM135 is strongly associated with mitochondria in vivo, although other intracellular organelles and small vesicles may be also associated with TMEM135."

TMEM135 punctate structures were often observed at mitochondrial constriction sites and at the tips of individual mitochondria. This unique localization pattern suggests a role of TMEM135 in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology. We isolated MFs from WT, <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025\u00a0</sup></i>and transgenic mice overexpressing WT <i>Tmem135</i> (Tg-Tmem135) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>), and stained the mitochondria with MitoTracker Red. Compared to WT cells with mitochondria of all different sizes and shapes, <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup></i> cells showed over-fused mitochondrial networks whereas Tg-Tmem135 cells exhibited over-fragmented mitochondrial networks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We used a morphology scoring assay (<a href=\"#bib34\">Loson et al., 2013</a>) in which each cell was categorized as having fragmented, tubular, elongated or aggregated mitochondria. Among <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>MFs, more cells were found to have elongated mitochondria relative to cells isolated from WT mice, indicating that more fusion occurs compared to fission in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In contrast, among Tg-Tmem135 MFs, more cells were found to have fragmented mitochondria relative to WT cells, suggesting that more fission than fusion takes place in Tg-Tmem135 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Next, we compared the number and size of mitochondria between <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN02</sup></i>, Tg-Tmem135 and WT MFs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013E</a>). The size of mitochondria increases and its number decreases in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>cells indicating that more mitochondrial fusion occurs than fission leading to elongated mitochondria. In contrast, the size and mass of mitochondria decrease in Tg-Tmem135 cells indicating that more fission than fusion takes place producing over-fragmented mitochondria. Observation that mitochondrial size increases in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>cells was further confirmed by knocking down <i>Tmem135</i> using RNA interference (RNAi). Knocking down 68% of <i>Tmem135</i> RNA in WT MFs using a short interfering RNA (siRNA) against <i>Tmem135</i> resulted in a significant increase in mitochondrial size compared to WT MFs treated with scrambled siRNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). We next analyzed the retinal mitochondrial morphology in the RPE as well as inner segments of photoreceptor cells from 12-month-old WT and <i>FUN025</i> mice using electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). We observed enlarged mitochondria in both the RPE and inner segments of photoreceptor cells from <i>FUN025</i> mice compared to those from WT mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>). Taken together, these results indicate that TMEM135 is involved in the regulation of the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion (mitochondrial dynamics)."

                                "text": "Two possible mechanisms underlie the mitochondrial morphological changes in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>and Tg-Tmem135 MFs. One possible mechanism is that TMEM135 may be involved in inhibition of mitochondrial fusion. We tested this hypothesis by promoting mitochondrial fusion through overexpression of mitochondrial fusion factor, mitofusin 2 (<i>MFN2</i>) in WT and Tg-Tmem135 MFs. If TMEM135 inhibits mitochondrial fusion, we would see less elongated mitochondria in Tg-Tmem135 cells compared to WT cells upon MFN2 overexpression. However, we observed similar number of elongated (with lower MFN2 expression) and aggregated (with higher MFN2 expression) mitochondria in WT and Tg-Tmem135 MFs transfected with p<i>MFN2-YFP</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The results indicate that overexpression of <i>Tmem135</i> in Tg-Tmem135 MFs does not inhibit the mitochondrial morphological changes caused by overexpression of <i>Mfn2</i>, suggesting that TMEM135 does not inhibit fusion. While it is also possible that downregulation of mitochondrial fusion proteins is responsible for over-fragmented mitochondria in Tg-TMEM135 MFs, which can be overcome by MFN2 overexpression, we found that this is not the case. The protein levels of mitochondrial fusion proteins, optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), MFN1 and MFN2 were not changed in Tg-TMEM135 MFs compared with WT MFs (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013E</a>). Additionally, the levels of these proteins are either unchanged (OPA1 and MFN2) or decreased (MFN1) in <i>FUN025</i> MFs compared with WT MFs (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013E</a>), indicating that the overly fused mitochondrial network observed in <i>FUN025</i> MFs was not caused by up-regulation of these mitochondrial fusion proteins. Another possible mechanism is that TMEM135 may promote mitochondrial fission. Dynamin related protein 1 (DRP1; also known as dynamin 1-like or DNM1L) is a mitochondrial dynamin-like GTPase that is essential for mitochondrial fission (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mears et al., 2011</a>). During mitochondrial fission, DRP1 is recruited from the cytosol onto the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it is assembled into puncta (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mears et al., 2011</a>). These puncta consist of oligomeric DRP1 complexes that wrap around and constrict the mitochondrial tubule to mediate fission (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mears et al., 2011</a>). We found that some of the punctate DRP1 signals colocalize with TMEM135 puncta on mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that TMEM135 may be involved in DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission. We first tested if DRP1 binding to mitochondria is affected in the <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>MFs using immunofluorescence to visualize DRP1 puncta on mitochondria. In MFs, much of the DRP1 staining was diffused in the cytosol, but a proportion could be found in punctate structures on mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). We used image analysis to quantify the density (number of puncta/mitochondrial area) of DRP1 puncta on mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>). The density of DRP1 puncta detected on mitochondria in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>MFs was not different from what was detected in WT MFs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>), indicating that DRP1 translocation to the mitochondria was not affected in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>MFs compared to WT MFs. The average total fluorescence per puncta (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>) was even increased in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>MFs while the mitochondria stayed fused. These results indicate that DRP1 is translocated to mitochondria normally and assembled into higher order structures but appears to stay inactive in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>MFs. DRP1 has been shown to be activated or inactivated through various post-translational modifications at different amino acids (<a href=\"#bib29\">Knott et al., 2008</a>). These results support the notion that TMEM135 may be required for DRP1 activation. To further characterize the role of TMEM135 in morphological changes of mitochondria, we monitored their dynamics in relation to mitochondria in living WT MFs and HT22 cells expressing GFP-TMEM135. We observed that a proportion of TMEM135 localized at mitochondrial constriction sites where mitochondria later divided (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Based on these data, we conclude that TMEM135 is more likely involved in mitochondrial fission rather than fusion."

Compared to WT MFs, <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>and Tg-Tmem135 MFs showed a lower basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). A significantly lower ATP production was detected in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup></i> and Tg-Tmem135 MFs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>MFs showed a decrease in the maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity (SRC), whereas Tg-Tmem135 showed no difference in these parameters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). The proton leak was not changed in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>and Tg-Tmem135 MFs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Our results suggest that the differences in mitochondrial basal and maximal respiration could be due to the change of mitochondrial dynamics. SRC is a measure of the extra capacity available in cells to produce energy in response to increased stress or work (<a href=\"#bib53\">van der Windt et al., 2012</a>). Our observation that <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>MFs have significantly reduced SRC suggests that the mutant TMEM135 not only affects oxidative phosphorylation at the normal condition but also decreases the potential ability for the mitochondria to produce more energy under stressed conditions."

While it can be postulated that disease-causing mechanisms interact with molecular/cellular changes that occur with aging, molecules and pathways linking the aging process and age-dependent diseases have not been identified. By using a forward genetics approach, we identified a novel mouse mutation that leads to accelerated aging as well as pathologies observed in age-dependent retinal disease (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Since this 'phenotype-driven' approach is unbiased and requires no prior knowledge of the gene functions, it allows the discovery of unsuspected mechanisms underlying biological phenomena and diseases. The mutation was discovered in transmembrane protein 135 (TMEM135), which has been associated with fat storage and longevity in <i>C. elegans</i> but has no defined molecular functions. Our results suggest that TMEM135 is critical for the regulation of the onset and progression of the aging process, a defect in which leads to age-dependent diseases. Thus, TMEM135 presents a novel molecular link between the aging process and age-dependent diseases."

The normal aging phenotypes in the mouse retina includes photoreceptor cell degeneration, ectopic synapse formation, and increased retinal stress (<a href=\"#bib22\">Higuchi et al., 2015</a>). While these age-dependent abnormalities are observed at 8 months on an aging-susceptible A/J background and later in a less susceptible B6 background (<a href=\"#bib22\">Higuchi et al., 2015</a>), <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>mice on the B6 background have an early onset (as early as 2 months of age) and more rapid advancement of the retinal aging phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We previously found that these retinal aging phenotypes all start from the peripheral retina and progress toward the central retina (<a href=\"#bib22\">Higuchi et al., 2015</a>). This spatial pattern of progression is unique to the retinal aging phenotypes in mice, and is maintained in the <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>retina albeit with earlier onset and faster progression, indicating that the retinal aging process is accelerated in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>mice. On the other hand, these mice also display pathologies observed in an age-dependent retinal disease, AMD, including autofluorescent aggregates, increased inflammation and thickened RPE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The fact that a single gene mutation leads to both accelerated aging and age-dependent disease pathologies in this mouse model provides a confirmation that these processes are closely associated with each other at the molecular level, and supports the idea that accelerating the aging process may lead to age-dependent diseases. Consistent with this idea, pathologies similar to those in the aging human retina including drusen formation, ectopic synapse formation and photoreceptor cell degeneration are observed in AMD patients with earlier onset and/or increased severity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eliasieh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hageman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Liets et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sullivan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Terzibasi et al., 2009</a>). Based on our finding, TMEM135 may be a key molecule that could tip the normal aging process toward age-dependent diseases."

We observed subretinal autofluorescent cells in the <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>retina that are positive for microglia and macrophage markers. Microglia have been reported to sense and react to different stimuli, and move toward the origin of stress or the injury site (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mcglade-Mcculloh et al., 1989</a>) while going through multiple morphological stages of microglial activation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jonas et al., 2012</a>). Upon evaluating the morphology and orientation of microglia in the <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>retina, we found that the microglia located closer to the RPE (and thus farther from the IPL) showed increased body size and decreased cell processes compared to those located closer to the IPL (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Similar morphological changes of microglia were documented in the injured rat olfactory bulb, and were classified as stages of microglial activation response to stimuli (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jonas et al., 2012</a>). The Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells near the apical surface of the RPE also show immunoreactivity to F4/80, indicating that they have transformed from microglia to macrophages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These data suggest that the RPE layer is the origin of stress, toward which the microglia migrate. In addition, in the <i>Tmem135</i> mutant retina, RPE abnormalities were observed earlier than the onset of photoreceptor cell degeneration. Since the RPE is located between the choriocapillaris/Bruch's membrane and the photoreceptors, and maintains the health of photoreceptor cells by delivering oxygen and metabolites and phagocytizing the shed photoreceptor outer segment discs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sparrow et al., 2010</a>), primary RPE defects could result in secondary loss of photoreceptor. Interestingly, this is consistent with the current hypothesis for pathogenesis of AMD (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bonilha, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Roth et al., 2004</a>). Together, our data suggest that the RPE and the subretinal space are likely affected first and become the origin of stress followed by photoreceptor cell loss in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>mice."

Since mitochondrial networks are the net product of fusion and fission events that occur within cells, there are two possible mechanisms TMEM135 can be involved in: inhibition of mitochondrial fusion or promotion of mitochondrial fission. Following observations in our study strongly indicated that TMEM135 in involved in promotion of mitochondrial fission rather than inhibition of mitochondrial fusion. First, experimentally promoting mitochondrial fusion through overexpression of mitochondrial fusion factor MFN2 in WT and Tg-Tmem135 cells resulted in similarly over-fused mitochondrial networks in WT and Tg-Tmem135 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>) indicating that TMEM135 does not inhibit mitochondrial fusion. Second, we observed that some of the TMEM135 signals are colocalized with punctate signals of the mitochondrial fission factor, DRP1, on mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Additionally, we found that DRP1 is normally translocated onto mitochondria which stay fused in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>mutant cells, indicating that DRP1 is not properly activated to promote fission. It has been shown that DRP1 activity is regulated delicately by a number of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, <i>S</i>-nitrosylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitination, and O-GlcNAcylation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cereghetti et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chang and Blackstone, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Knott et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zunino et al., 2007</a>).

Although we cannot completely rule out this possibility, it is unlikely that oxidative stress is the major cause of mitochondrial fragmentation in Tg-TMEM135 cells. While ROS is increased in both <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup></i> mutant cells and Tg-TMEM135 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H,I</a>), mitochondrial networks are over-fused in mutant cells and over-fragmented in Tg-TMEM135 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013E</a>), suggesting the TMEM135 function rather than oxidative stress as the primary factor affecting the mitochondrial networks in these cells. In addition, our live imaging of GFP-TMEM135 in WT MFs and HT22 cells captured the direct interaction of TMEM135 with mitochondria at fission sites, providing additional evidence that the TMEM135 function in mitochondrial fission rather than oxidative stress is the cause of altered mitochondrial networks."

We found that adult mouse fibroblasts with either over-fused (<i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup></i> mutant) or over-fragmented (Tg-TMEM135) mitochondria show impairment of respiration, indicating that the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion is important for proper respiratory functions. In addition to lower basal respiration and ATP production, <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup></i> mutant fibroblasts also showed decreased SRC. SRC or \u2018spare respiratory capacity\u2019 refers to the difference between basal and maximal respiration, which reflects the extra mitochondrial capacity available in a cell to produce energy under conditions of increased work or stress (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nicholls, 2009</a>). Exhaustion of the SRC has been associated with heart diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and smooth muscle death (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hill et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nicholls, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sansbury et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yadava and Nicholls, 2007</a>). It has been also hypothesized that mitochondria contributes to aging and age-dependent pathologies through a life-long continued decrease of the SRC (<a href=\"#bib12\">Desler et al., 2012</a>). The <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>mutation that leads to decreased SRC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) and accelerated retinal aging phenotypes provides new evidence to support this hypothesis. In addition, both <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>and Tg-Tmem135 MFs have increased total ROS and superoxide compared to WT MFs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H,I</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating increased oxidative stress and damage. Based on the decreased SRC and increased ROS in <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>MFs, we hypothesized that the <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>retina may be more vulnerable to the increase of environmental stress. Our animal study showed that <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>mice under the hyperoxic condition had more severe retinal degeneration, apoptosis in the retina and retinal stress compared to WT mice under the hyperoxic condition (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). These results suggest that while WT mice can tolerate certain amount of oxidative stress, <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>mutant mice with a decline in mitochondrial functions have lower tolerance to such stress. Thus, <i>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </i>mutant mice are more susceptible to damages caused by environmental stressors, accumulation of which leads to accelerated aging and age-dependent diseases with early onset. In conclusion, both our cell and animal studies suggest a role for TMEM135 in protecting cells from increased environmental stress."

These mice on the C57BL/6J genetic background were imported to University of Wisconsin-Madison. Affected <i>FUN025</i> mice were crossed to C57BL/6J wild-type mice and the offspring were crossed to affected mice. Subsequently, the mutant line was maintained by crossing affected (based on phenotyping by fundus photography) mice to non-affected siblings, which were presumably heterozygous for the recessive mutation.

The construct was micro-injected into pronuclei of FVB/NJ embryos at the Transgenic Facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. Transgene-positive founders were crossed to C57BL/6J mice for two generations and subsequently maintained by intercrossing. The <i>Ped6b<sup>rd1</sup></i> mutation in the FVB/NJ background was removed during this process. Mice with a point mutation (T &gt; C) in <i>Tmem135</i> that is the same as observed in <i>FUN025</i> mice were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (T &gt; C mice). The T &gt; C mutation was introduced into intron 12 of <i>Tmem135</i> (Chr7:96,296,478) in C57BL/6J mice at Translational Genomics Facility of University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. \u2018Optimized CRISPR Design\u2019 (<a href=\"http://crispr.mit.edu/\">http://crispr.mit.edu/</a>) was used to choose the sequence (5\u2019-GCCAAGCACACAGGGTTTGC-3\u2019) that is located at 28 to 47 nucleotides downstream of the mutation site. This DNA sequence was incorporated into the px330 plasmid (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cong et al., 2013</a>) (kindly provided by Feng Zhang) for generation of the single guide RNA (sgRNA). In vitro transcription template was generated by PCR using the plasmid and an oligo with a T7 adapter end, and the sgRNA was transcribed using the MEGAshortscript T7 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and purified with the MEGAclear Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). In addition, we used a 200 nucleotide oligo DNA containing the point mutation (T &gt; C) in the middle of the sequence as a donor oligo (5\u2019-AGTTTTTCCTTGTCATTTCAGGGTTTTTGGCAGGTGTGTCGATGATGTTTTATAAAAGCACAACAATTTCCATGTACCTAGCTTCCAAGCTGGTGGAGGcAAGCACAGCTCTTATGCCTGAGAAGTTGCCAAGCACACAGGGTTTGCAGGTGGTGTGGAGTTGCTTCAGTTGCAAGAATGACTGCTACCAAAGCAGCTCT -3\u2019).

Authentication and quality control tests on distributed lots of cell lines were performed by the distributors. No cell lines used in this study are cross-contaminated or misidentified by International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC). Primary fibroblasts were harvested from three-month-old mouse ears. Briefly, two pieces of ear punched tissues were collected into a 1.5\u2009ml microcentrifuge tube containing 70% ethanol, and the tissue pieces were rinsed with PBS containing penicillin and streptomycin. The tissues were diced into small pieces using a razor blade in a 6 cm Petri dish, and gathered into a microcentrifuge tube with 0.5\u2009ml Trypsin-EDTA (0.25% Trypsin, 0.1% EDTA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and 0.5\u2009ml Dispase (5\u2009U/ml) (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). The tissues were incubated at 37\u00b0 C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000\u2009rpm. The supernatant was discarded and the tissues were washed with 2\u2009ml HBSS. After centrifugation for 5 min at 3000\u2009rpm, the supernatant was discarded. Then, 0.5\u2009ml trypsin-EDTA was added to the precipitated cells. After mixing thoroughly, cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C for 20 min. Following incubation, the solution was centrifuged and the supernatant was decanted. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5\u2009ml fibroblast culture media: Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM, ATCC, Manassas, VA) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, ATCC, Manassas, VA), 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cell aggregates were triturated and cell suspension was plated into a 3 cm tissue culture dish with 2\u2009ml fibroblasts culture medium. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Fibroblasts were sub-cultured every 2\u20134 days at 1:4 to 1:6 ratio. Cells were split similarly for expansion into T75 flasks for final harvest. Fibroblasts were tested for mycoplasma contamination and the results were negative. Primary hippocampal cell culture was performed using SPOT culture kit (University of Illinois at Chicago). COS-7 cells (ATCCCRL-1651, passage number 2\u20134; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0224\">CVCL_0224</a>) were obtained from a biological resource center, ATCC and used at low-passage. ATCC perform authentication and quality-control tests on all distribution lots of cell lines. COS-7 cells were maintained and sub-cultured according to the suggested culture methods from ATCC (<a href=\"http://www.atcc.org/\">www.atcc.org/</a>). COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS.

Cell Rep. 2015.13(5):990-1002.), which show similar staining patterns as ours. In order to confirm the staining pattern, we have also used other mitochondrial markers on the retinal sections, which produced similar staining patterns as anti-TOMM20. Since the TOMM20 staining in the retina does not clearly show mitochondrial shapes, we have also cultured RPE cells from the mouse retina and stained them with the mitochondrial marker and the TMEM135 antibody.
