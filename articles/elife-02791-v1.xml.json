We calculate statistics, either correctly or incorrectly, in hope of gaining confidence that we are capturing some truth through our measurements.

(I was avoiding doing a particularly annoying academic task, so this was an amusing waste of time). To my surprise, my h-index was 72 on Google Scholar and 64 on Web of Science, a not inconsequential difference. Then I compared the number of times that some of my papers had been cited. I found that one paper (<a href=\"#bib1\">Hooper and Marder, 1987</a>) had 167 citations in Google Scholar and 161 in Web of Science, which was a difference of just a few per cent. But then I discovered that another paper (<a href=\"#bib2\">Marder and Calabrese, 1996</a>) had 894 citations on Google Scholar and only 636 citations on Web of Science, which was a difference of about 30%!"

In the past 18 months I have published five \u2018Living Science\u2019 essays in <i>eLife</i>. Every few months prurient interest and vanity have caused me to look at number of views each of these pieces has attracted. Imagine my confusion when, recently, I discovered that the number of views for two of them had dropped substantially during the past several months! I still don\u2019t know if the old values or new values are correct, or why the number of views has decreased, but it does give me pause in believing the reliability of such numbers, not only in <i>eLife</i>, but as posted by all journals."

How is it possible that thousands of careful scientists who spend months and years checking and rechecking their own data, would blithely and blindly accept these numbers? Is a journal impact factor of 3.82 different from one of 4.3, even though there are some review panels who treat them as if they are different and make decisions about promotions accordingly? How many of us would not ask questions of investigators in their own fields about how the data were collected, analysed and verified? And yet how many of us have the foggiest idea how exactly the numbers of citations for publications have been collected, and what verification procedures are used?"

As I stood there unable to get my head out of the bars, I felt very stupid, as I realised I could have measured the distance between the bars by holding my hands apart, without getting stuck. It was my first real experience of feeling truly self-consciously dumb. Many years later I feel equally stupid for believing that the numbers that have become so important to so many careers are reliable. I have never believed that these numbers are wisely used in assessments, but now I know there is all the more reason to forget all of these indexes and metrics and to focus on the science."
