We observed that receptor-negative cancer cells could be stimulated by the soluble chemokines. Searching for alternative receptors we detected that all cells expressing or transfected with transmembrane chemokine ligands bound the soluble chemokines with high affinity and responded by phosphorylation of intracellular kinases, enhanced proliferation and anti-apoptosis. This activity requires the intracellular domain and apparently the dimerization of the transmembrane chemokine ligand. Thus, shed soluble chemokines can generate auto- or paracrine signals by binding and activating their transmembrane forms. We term this novel mechanism \u201cinverse signaling\u201d. We suppose that inverse signaling is an autocrine feedback and fine-tuning system in the communication between cells that in tumors supports stabilization and proliferation."

We observed that receptor-negative cancer cells could be stimulated by the soluble chemokines. Searching for alternative receptors we detected that all cells expressing or transfected with transmembrane chemokine ligands bound the soluble chemokines with high affinity and responded by phosphorylation of intracellular kinases, enhanced proliferation and anti-apoptosis. This activity requires the intracellular domain and apparently the dimerization of the transmembrane chemokine ligand. Thus, shed soluble chemokines can generate auto- or paracrine signals by binding and activating their transmembrane forms. We term this novel mechanism \u201cinverse signaling\u201d. We suppose that inverse signaling is an autocrine feedback and fine-tuning system in the communication between cells that in tumors supports stabilization and proliferation."

Reverse signaling can induce several biological functions, e. g. co-stimulation, silencing, transmission of additional signals (<a href=\"#bib6\">Eissner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sun and Fink, 2007</a>), or synapse formation and plasticity in the nervous system (<a href=\"#bib26\">Klein, 2009</a>). Reverse signaling may thus be an alternative to an autocrine-signaling loop with classical receptors. So far, reverse signaling has only been reported for distinct transmembrane ligand molecules although signaling motifs for reverse signaling are more abundant and also found within the transmembrane variants of the chemokine family."

Therefore, we looked for alternative functions and receptors. We found that cells expressing high levels of a <i>tm-</i>chemokine also responded to their soluble counterparts without expressing the respective G protein-coupled chemokine receptor. Further detailed investigations revealed that <i>tm-</i>chemokines themselves, in fact, responded to soluble chemokines via a novel mechanism by binding their soluble forms and subsequently inducing signals and functional responses. We propose that this novel mechanism leads to auto- or paracrine activation of cells expressing <i>tm</i>-chemokines that either function as surface receptor or can be shed to generate soluble ligands of another <i>tm</i>-chemokine on the cell surface."

Beside tumor cells, also endothelial cells and monocytes like THP-1 cells express <i>tm</i>-chemokines. In contrast to this broad distribution of ligands, the expression of the receptors CXCR6 and CX3CR1 was restricted to only a few cell types, e.g. activated T-cells (positive control, compare <a href=\"#bib28\">Ludwig et al., 2005</a>) or monocytes/monocytic THP-1 cells. The expression of CX3CL1 and CXCL16 was confirmed on protein level by immunocytochemistry (lower panel of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), which revealed high expression for the brain tumor cell lines and low expression for the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7. The LOX melanoma cell line showed no protein expression, and therefore was chosen as a control cell line in the subsequent experiments. CXCR6 and CX3CR1 were not detectable in the solid tumor cell lines on protein level either (not shown) by immunocytochemistry using antibodies that were suitable for this application in recent investigations (<a href=\"#bib17\">Held-Feindt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hattermann et al., 2013</a>).

Pre-incubation with <i>Pertussis</i> toxin did not influence signal transduction of responsive <i>tm</i>-chemokine-positive cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Its inhibitory effect was confirmed in stimulations of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup>-THP-1 cells. Also, an engineered peptide receptor-antagonist of fractalkine (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hermand et al., 2008</a>) mediated ERK phosphorylation in primary glioma cells comparable to the recombinant soluble peptide (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, lower part). We additionally analyzed the expression profile of a broad panel of CXC-chemokine and decoy receptors. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, glioma cell lines did not express CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR6, CX3CR1, but high levels of CXCR7, which is a receptor for CXCL11 and CXCL12 and can mediate G-protein independent signals via arrestin (<a href=\"#bib33\">Odemis et al., 2012</a>). However, inhibition of CXCR7 by the synthetic antagonist (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hattermann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yamaguchi et al., 2014</a>) CCX733 exhibited no influence on <i>tm</i>-chemokine signaling (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). As chemokine decoy receptors (D6, DARC, CCX-CKR) were expressed in glioma as well as LOX cells, they could be ruled out as mediators for <i>tm</i>-chemokine effects that were absent in the melanoma cells. A viral encoded putative receptor for CX3CL1, US28 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Matlaf et al., 2013</a>), was detected neither in glioma cells, nor in LOX melanoma cells, and thus, can be excluded for <i>s-</i>CXCL16 or <i>s-</i>CX3CL1 signaling. Additionally, the expression of CD44, a receptor for hyaluronic acid and further ligands, e.g. CCL5 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Roscic-Mrkic et al., 2005</a>)was determined at comparable protein levels in glioma cells and melanoma cells. These findings as well as independence of <i>s-</i>chemokine-mediated signal transduction from <i>Pertussis</i> toxin suggest that classical G protein-coupled chemokine receptors are not involved in the described effects of <i>s</i>-chemokines. Furthermore, related CXC-receptors and chemokine decoy receptors are absent or can be excluded as functional receptors for <i>s</i>-CXCL16 or <i>s</i>-CX3CL1 as well as other types of receptors that require G<sub>i/o</sub>-association."

However, in CX3CR1-expressing THP-1 cells (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) CX3CL1 mediated phosphorylation of Akt (stimulation with 1 nM for 20 min) can be inhibited by pre-incubation with PTX. An engineered variant of CX3CL1, the recombinant CX3CR1-antagonist F1 (100 nM, 20 min) induces also signal transduction in primary glioma cells indicating a mechanism different from CX3CR1-binding (and antagonism). Shown are representative Western blots after SDS-PAGE separation of lysates from stimulated U343 or A764 glioma cells stained for pERK 1/2 or pAkt (re-blot to non-phosphorylated kinases, control of equal loading) from 3 independent experiments, compare <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. (<b>B</b>)\u00a0The transcription profile of classical chemokine receptors and chemokine decoy receptors as determined by quantitative RT-PCR shows that the chemokine receptors CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR6 and CX3CR1 are absent in responsive U343 and A764 and non-responsive LOX cells. However, the atypical chemokine receptor CXCR7 that is known to signal G protein-independently is expressed in responsive cell lines and absent in LOX cells. The chemokine decoy receptors D6 and CCX-CKR are expressed at comparable levels in responsive and non-responsive cells, whereas DARC is absent (n = 3 biological replicates, indicated by diamonds). Additionally, the cytomegalovirus-derived gene US28 that encodes for a putative CX3CR1 receptor could not be detected in these cell lines. The highly glycosylated protein CD44, that may putatively sequester chemokines, was detected at comparable protein levels in U343, A764 and LOX cells (n = 3). (<b>C</b>)\u00a0To investigate the contribution of CXCR7 in <i>s</i>-chemokine mediated signaling U343 cells were pre-incubated with the CXCR7-antagonist CCX733 (100 nM, 2 hr) and stimulated with 1 nM of <i>s</i>-CXCL16 or <i>s</i>-CX3CL1 for 20 min.

This could be clearly shown in primary glioblastoma cells and corresponding cell lines. After transfection with <i>tm-</i>chemokine expression vectors, previously non-responsive cells may also exert inverse signaling upon stimulation with <i>s-</i>chemokines. Opposite to overexpression, silencing of <i>tm</i>-chemokines reduces signaling induced by <i>s</i>-chemokine stimulation. Consequently, by two different approaches (overexpression and silencing) signal transduction of the <i>s</i>-chemokines was shown to depend on the expression level of transmembrane CXCL16 or CX3CL1 in the responsive cell line. Apart from recombinant peptides, also the naturally shed soluble ligands as contained in conditioned media were able to induce inverse signaling and, as a sign of specificity, antibodies raised against the chemokine domain of CXCL16 or CX3CL1 yielded comparable signals. This activation of <i>tm</i>-chemokine signaling by intact antibodies but not by corresponding monovalent F(ab) fragments supports a putative necessity of di/oligomerization of the <i>tm</i>-chemokines for the inverse signaling.

For example, TNF-\u03b1, FasL and other members of the TNF family, contain S/TXXS/T sequences and proline-rich domains (FasL) that can bind adaptor proteins and thereby transduce signals (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kennelly and Krebs, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Watts et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Eissner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sun and Fink, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amanchy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Daar, 2012</a>).

As shown by transfection/stimulation experiments with C-terminally-truncated <i>tm</i>-chemokines, the intact intracellular domains are also essential for the inverse signaling. Identification of the exact binding sites for kinases/adaptor proteins are ongoing and beyond the scope of this investigation. Potential activation sites include cytoplasmic SXXS-sequences (comparable to those of the TNF family) and additionally SH2-binding sites (YXPV/R). In CX3CL1, both sites are highly conserved from monotremes through marsupials to highly developed mammals; in the case of CXCL16, they are found \u2013 as far as known - in primates and only same mammals (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Thus, the transfer to a rodent <i>in vivo</i> model has to be carefully designed. Of note, the reverse signaling of TNF-\u03b1 has long been described (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ferran et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lettau et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Eissner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shao and Schwarz, 2011</a>), but exact mechanisms of further downstream signaling are not yet known.

Reverse signaling of ephrins triggers cell adhesion or differentiation, in particular in the nervous system, spine and synapse formation, but also in bone modeling (<a href=\"#bib26\">Klein, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Matsuo and Otaki, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yu et al., 2010</a>), whereas reverse signaling of semaphorins similarly regulates cell guiding and repulsion, especially in the nervous system (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yu et al., 2010</a>). As far as we know, inverse signaling of transmembrane chemokines appears to induce mainly autocrine stimulatory and stabilizing effects like increased proliferation and anti-apoptosis. These tumor cell protective effects could also be confirmed in transfection experiments enabling a direct comparison of the chemokine effects in <i>tm-</i>chemokine expressing versus not-expressing cells of the same cell line. To our knowledge, these effects seem to depend on the <i>tm</i>-chemokine expression level rather than the (tumor) cell type. Obviously, tumors would clearly profit from such positive feedback. The importance of autocrine loops in many types of tumors becomes obvious regarding for example growth factors like epidermal (EGF) or platelet-derived (PDGF) growth factors. However, also in inflammation or under non-pathological conditions in tissue development these stabilizing autocrine loops may\u00a0play important roles."

The release of the chemokine domain is mediated by the cell surface proteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 in a constitutive (mainly ADAM10) or cytokine-induced manner (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ludwig et al., 2005</a>). ADAM17 was initially discovered as TNF-\u03b1-converting enzyme (TACE) liberating soluble cytokine from the transmembrane form. Later, other ADAMs were identified as similar \u2018sheddases\u2019, but they also cleave receptors, adhesion molecules and intracellular signaling molecules (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pruessmeyer and Ludwig, 2009</a>). ADAMs are supposed to terminate reverse signaling by cleaving transmembrane ligands of the TNF family bound to their receptors (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sun and Fink, 2007</a>). In case of ephrin-A, ADAM10 is constitutively associated with the EphA receptor that clusters and is activated upon ligand binding; this positions the proteinase domain for effective ephrin-A5 cleavage and the cleavage occurs in <i>trans</i>, with ADAM10 and its substrate being on the membranes of opposing cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Janes et al., 2005</a>). This mechanism ensures that only Eph-bound ephrins are recognized and cleaved. A corresponding regulatory role of ADAMs as for reverse can also be supposed for inverse signaling. Since different physiological and pathophysiological mediators or therapeutics tightly regulate ADAM activities (<a href=\"#bib37\">Reiss and Saftig, 2009</a>), inverse signaling should also be modulated in diverse ways in health and disease. However, this question may only be satisfactory addressed in carefully designed future <i>in vivo</i> experiments."

For example in an inflammatory context, binding of <i>s-</i>chemokines to <i>tm-</i>counterparts might reduce the recruitment of immune cells expressing the classical receptors, and vice versa might a massive infiltration of <i>s-</i>chemokine binding immune cells reduce the effects of inverse signaling. Moreover, it can be hypothesized that inverse signaling interacts with signaling of classical receptors, e.g. by adapter proteins. Thus, the observed novel mechanism adds to the understanding of the complex chemokine system."

Transfection was performed with TurboFect (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) in serum-free DMEM without antibiotics using 4 \u00b5g of the respective expression vectors with pcDNA3.1 backbone and 4 \u00b5l TurboFect in a total volume of 1 ml. After 6 hr, cells were rinsed and normal growth medium (RPMI + 10% FCS) was added. Successful transfection was controlled by immunocytochemistry and/or qRT-PCR. Stable clones were generated by selection with 0.75 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem), and colonies were picked after 10\u201320 days, amplified and checked for expression by quantitative RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Site directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit following the manufacturer\u00b4s advice (Agilent Technologies, B\u00f6blingen, Germany). The complementary primer pairs were designed to generate a double stop codon following the transmembrane domain (MWG-Biotech, AG Ebersberg, Germany; CXCL16: 5\u2019-ctttcctatgtgctg<b>tgatag</b>aggaggagggggcag-3\u2019, CX3CL1: 5\u2019-tggccatgttcacctac<b>tagtaa</b>ctccagggctgccctcg-3\u2019) yielding expression of C-terminally truncated <i>tm-</i>chemokines, respectively. Successful mutations were verified by sequencing of the plasmids (GATC Biotech AG, Koblenz, Germany). Surface expression of overexpressed native or truncated <i>tm</i>-chemokines was verified by immunocytochemistry. Successful C-terminal truncation of CXCL16 was proven by immunocytochemistry (see below) using antibodies against the extracellular chemokine of CXCL16 (PeproTech, #500-P200) and the HA-tag of CXCL16 (Cell signaling, #2367, clone 6E2). Successful C-terminal truncation of CX3CL1 was proven by band shift in western blot (see below) with an antibody against the extracellular domain of CX3CL1 (Pepro Tech, #500-P98). Therefore, cell membranes were isolated<sup>17</sup> and - to obtain defined bands - subjected to N-deglycosylation by PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Western blot was performed as described below."

Primary antibodies were: anti-CXCL16 and anti-CX3CL1 (both from rabbit, diluted 1:100 in PBS, PeproTech), and anti-HA (mouse, 1:100; Cell signaling); secondary antibodies: donkey anti-rabbit or donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa 555 (1:800, Invitrogen/ Life technologies). For binding experiments with CXCL16, cells were incubated with directly Cy3-labeled CXCL16 or lactalbumin (negative control with comparable molecular weight) at 4\u00b0C for 60 min in the dark, washed, fixed and nuclei counterstained with DAPI.

For flow cytometry analyses, cells were detached using 0,5 mM EDTA, stained with the CX3CL1 Fluorokine Assay following the manufacturer\u2019s advice. For CXCL16 experiments, recombinant CXCL16 (Pepro Tech) was biotinylated with the One-step antibody biotinylation kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA) and used (instead of biotinylated CX3CL1) with the Fluorokine kit components. Cells were analyzed using a FACSCanto System (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany).

Cover slips were washed again and incubated with 3 \u00b5g/ml either recombinant CXCL16 with adsorbed 5 nm gold particles or with biotinylated recombinant CX3CL1 (R&amp;D; Systems) and subsequent with streptavidin adsorbed to 5 nm gold particles (British BioCell International).

Samples were only slightly contrasted (45 min 2% osmium tetroxide before embedding and 5 min uranyl acetate (saturated) after sectioning), as strong contrasting (e.g. with lead citrate) would not allow for clear detection of gold particles. Thus, contrast of electron micrographs was digitally enhanced. Images shown are representative views of 3 (ICC) or 2 (FACS, EM) independent stimulations/ immunostainings."

In each experiment, three scratch regions were photographed at 0 and 24 hr. Scratch areas were measured and differences between 24 and 0 hr were determined (yielding the settled area). Stimuli were normalized to non-stimulated controls. To measure proliferation, 5000 cells/well were seeded on 96 well plates and grown for 24 hr. Then media were changed to DMEM containing 1% BSA (plus respective stimuli or 10% fetal calf serum as positive control). After 24 hr incubation, proliferation was determined by the measurement of tetrazolium salt WST-1 cleavage (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and normalized to non-stimulated control (3 individual wells for each stimulus). To investigate reduction of apoptosis, 300.000 cells were seeded in 25 mm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks and cultured for 2 days to reach confluency of 80%.

The authors provide data that shed chemokines can act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. They termed this mechanism \"inverse\" signaling. They put these results in the context of tumor biology and suggest it is a previously unrecognized of cell to cell communication. The signaling mechanism identified is novel, with a wealth of evidence of its functionality in vitro, in several cell line models. Cells negative for the classical receptors respond with the soluble chemokines in the presence of the membrane bound forms, non-responsive cells will respond to the soluble chemokines after transfecting the cells with the transmembrane forms, and inactivating the transmembrane forms by deleting their c-terminus, responsible for the intracellular domain diminish the signal transduction. Furthermore the authors showed the binding of the soluble forms to the transmembrane forms, and also other evidence for the novel signaling is provided."

To address this question (expression of <i>tm-</i>chemokines = on/off?), we now show more ICC stainings for CXCL16 and CX3CL1 of selected cell lines in the bottom of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. These micrographs clearly indicate that expression levels are different in the respective (tumor) cell lines: while the brain tumor cell lines (glioma, neuroblastoma) show strong expression patterns, the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 shows only slight protein expression of the transmembrane chemokines. The LOX melanoma cell line does not express CXCL16 or CX3CL1 on protein level. Corresponding text passages have been added to the Results and the figure legend. Thus, protein expression corresponds to the mRNA expression levels obtained by qRT-PCR. However, these data are presented in a log-scale in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> (top). Thus, expression differences shown in the graph appear to be smaller than they are. To facilitate the readability of these data, we have added an explanation on \u0394C<sub>T</sub> values (a 3.33 alteration of \u0394C<sub>T</sub> value corresponds to a ten-fold altered expression) in this part of the Results section."

Thus, we have performed some additional experiments addressing the activation of the MAP kinase pathway and the rescue from apoptosis also with MCF-7 cells, and added the respective results to the Supplementary material (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2). Indeed, the <i>tm</i>-chemokine low expressing cell line MCF-7 shows only slight activation of MAP kinase signaling upon stimulation with <i>s</i>-chemokines, and the rescue from apoptosis is only mild, and hardly robust."

To, however, more properly address the raised concern, we performed stimulation experiments with a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, expressing low levels of <i>tm</i>-chemokines. As mentioned above, this cell line showed also activation of the MAP kinase pathway and a rescue from apoptosis. However, these effects were clearly smaller and less robust in comparison to the <i>tm</i>-chemokine high expressing glioma cell lines.
