In response to muscle overload after synergist ablation in mice, we show that myomaker, a muscle specific membrane protein essential for myoblast fusion, is activated mainly in muscle progenitors and not myofibers. We rendered muscle progenitors fusion-incompetent through genetic deletion of myomaker in muscle stem cells and observed a complete reduction of overload-induced hypertrophy. This blunted hypertrophic response was associated with a reduction in Akt and p70s6k signaling and protein synthesis, suggesting a link between myonuclear accretion and activation of pro-hypertrophic pathways. Furthermore, fusion-incompetent muscle exhibited increased fibrosis after muscle overload, indicating a protective role for normal stem cell activity in reducing myofiber strain associated with hypertrophy. These findings reveal an essential contribution of myomaker-mediated stem cell fusion during physiological adult muscle hypertrophy."

SCs reside underneath the basal lamina in a quiescent state, and upon injury, become activated to generate a pool of myogenic progenitors (MPs) that differentiate and fuse to each other or existing myofibers to restore structure and function to muscle (<a href=\"#bib34\">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yin et al., 2013</a>). While SCs are clearly necessary for efficient regeneration after acute injury (<a href=\"#bib17\">G\u00fcnther et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lepper et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sambasivan et al., 2011</a>), the role of SCs during adult muscle hypertrophy and maintenance is much less understood. Moreover, the regulation of myogenic fusion is relatively unknown compared to the knowledge associated with activation, proliferation, and differentiation of SCs. Elucidation of the magnitude of fusion, and the associated molecular regulation of the fusion process, for adult muscle hypertrophy may lead to strategies that augment loss of muscle mass due to chronic disease and aging."

Fundamentally, skeletal muscle hypertrophy occurs when the rates of muscle protein synthesis exceed those of protein degradation. In addition to activation of protein synthesis pathways directly in the myofiber, a myofiber could hypertrophy through fusion of SCs leading to a greater capacity for transcription of contractile machinery. The contribution of SCs for hypertrophy was initially justified through the concept of the myonuclear domain (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cheek et al., 1965</a>), which postulates a coordinated increase between myonuclei number and cytoplasm volume in order to maintain a constant domain size (<a href=\"#bib41\">Snow, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tamaki et al., 1996</a>). Moreover, myonuclear accretion precedes an increase in skeletal muscle size (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bruusgaard et al., 2010</a>), and loss of serum response factor (Srf) in the myofiber blunts hypertrophy potentially through a SC-mediated mechanism (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guerci et al., 2012</a>), altogether implicating a role for fusion during hypertrophy. Studies utilizing diphtheria toxin (DTA)-mediated ablation of SCs have revealed that effective myofiber hypertrophy occurs in the absence of satellite cells and that SCs are not required to maintain muscle mass during aging (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fry et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">McCarthy et al., 2011</a>), however SC ablation leads to impaired coordination and diminished muscle performance (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jackson et al., 2015</a>). Additionally, SCs contribute to myofibers during aging of sedentary mice although SC activity was not globally required to maintain muscle size (<a href=\"#bib21\">Keefe et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pawlikowski et al., 2015</a>). Recently, a report utilizing a similar DTA SC ablation model indicates that effective myofiber hypertrophy does not occur in the absence of SCs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Egner et al., 2016</a>). Thus, there is no consensus regarding the contributions of SCs during adult skeletal muscle hypertrophy, highlighting the need for more independent models that assess the biology of SC activity."

In this acute injury setting where there is complete destruction of the muscle architecture, the ensuing restoration is the sole responsibility of SCs. Here, all MPs exhibit upregulation of myomaker, and we have shown that fusion is more efficient if both fusing cells express myomaker (<a href=\"#bib28\">Millay et al., 2016</a>).

In the absence of myomaker induction in SCs, we report an impaired hypertrophic response to MOV, which is associated with a failure to activate Akt/mTOR-mediated protein synthesis within the myofiber. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that effective SC fusion is required for optimal muscle hypertrophy following a load-induced stimulus."

                                "text": "To determine the regulation of MP fusion during adult skeletal muscle hypertrophy, we first assessed the temporal kinetics of myomaker expression after MOV. In wild-type (WT) mice at baseline, myomaker mRNA and protein are not readily detected in muscle, however myomaker is acutely induced after MOV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>). Expression of myomaker peaked 7 days after MOV, and was down-regulated at later time points. To elucidate if myomaker was induced in activated MPs or by the myofiber during MOV, we analyzed <i>Tmem8c</i><sup>LacZ/+</sup> mice, which contain a <i>LacZ</i> cassette in intron 1 of the myomaker locus (<a href=\"#bib30\">Millay et al., 2014</a>). This allele results in exon 1 of myomaker splicing with <i>LacZ</i>, generating a transcript with exon 1 of myomaker, and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that allows independent translation of <i>LacZ</i>. Thus, in this system <i>LacZ</i> serves as a readout for myomaker transcription but not myomaker localization. X-gal staining of the plantaris muscle from <i>Tmem8c</i><sup>LacZ/+</sup> mice at multiple time points after MOV revealed detectable <i>LacZ</i> in discrete locations surrounding the myofiber at day 3 of MOV, and in myofibers at later stages of MOV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To understand the myogenic state of the different types of LacZ<sup>+</sup> cells we stained serial sections with either x-gal or embryonic myosin (myh3), a marker of muscle differentiation. Here we observed a population of large LacZ<sup>+</sup> cells and a population of small LacZ<sup>+</sup> cells that were in the presumptive SC position (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We classified the large LacZ<sup>+</sup> cells as myofibers due to their size, and these were either myh3<sup>+</sup> or myh3<sup>-</sup>. For myofibers, LacZ<sup>+</sup> myh3<sup>+</sup> cells exhibited stronger x-gal staining compared to the LacZ<sup>+</sup> myh3<sup>-</sup> cells (punctate staining) suggesting that the former population are de novo fibers formed from the fusion of MPs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We interpret the punctate LacZ<sup>+</sup> myh3<sup>-</sup> myofibers as existing fibers that have fused with a MP. The population of small LacZ<sup>+</sup> cells were either myh3<sup>+</sup> (differentiated myocytes) or myh3<sup>-</sup> (MPs), and we classified these as the non-myofiber population (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Quantification of these populations multiple days after MOV revealed an increase in myomaker-expressing MPs at the early stages of MOV (days 3 and 7), followed by a reduction at later stages of MOV (days 10 and 14) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In contrast, the majority of LacZ<sup>+</sup> myofibers were observed at later stages of MOV, with negligible occurrence at 3 days after MOV. Thus, myomaker exhibits a contrasting expression pattern in MPs compared to the myofiber compartment in response to a load-induced stimulus."

(<b>C</b>) <i>Tmem8c<sup>LacZ/+</sup></i> mice were subjected to MOV and plantaris sections were X-gal stained at multiple time points after surgery. LacZ, a surrogate for myomaker expression, was observed in MPs (arrows) during the early stages of MOV, and in myofibers (arrowheads) in the later stages of MOV. Quantification of the number of LacZ<sup>+</sup> non-myofibers indicates myomaker is robustly activated in MPs at day 3 and day 7 of MOV but the number is reduced at day 10 and day 14 (n\u00a0=\u00a03\u20135 mice). Quantification of LacZ<sup>+</sup> myofibers demonstrates the majority of expression occurs at day 7 and day 10 after MOV (n\u00a0=\u00a02500\u20134,100 myofibers from 3\u20135 independent mice). (<b>D</b>) Fusion of MPs with myofibers was assessed by labeling proliferating cells with BrdU and tracking their incorporation into a myofiber, identified by immunostaining with a dystrophin antibody.

Fusion was scored as a BrdU<sup>+</sup> nucleus within a dystrophin<sup>+</sup> myofiber as depicted by the arrows. Quantification of the percentage of myofibers containing a BrdU<sup>+</sup> nucleus shows an increased labeling of fusion competent satellite cells during the first 7 days of MOV, which correlates with the highest expression of myomaker in satellite cells (n\u00a0=\u00a0380\u20131,511 myofibers from 3\u20139 independent mice).

To determine the source of LacZ in myofibers during MOV, we blocked the ability of MPs to fuse through genetic deletion of myomaker. <i>Tmem8c</i><sup>LacZ/loxP</sup> mice were bred with satellite cell-specific Cre recombinase (<i>Pax7</i><sup>CreERT2/+</sup>) mice (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lepper et al., 2009</a>), and subsequently treated with tamoxifen to genetically delete myomaker in muscle progenitor cells (myomaker scKO).

Mice were injected with tamoxifen for 5 consecutive days prior to MOV and maintained on a tamoxifen dosage throughout the protocol. qPCR analysis confirmed the efficiency of this tamoxifen-based strategy, as myomaker expression was eliminated in myomaker scKO muscle compared to control muscle 7 days after MOV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To be certain that this model maintains the presence of SCs during MOV we crossed the <i>Rosa26</i><sup>mTmG</sup> genetic lineage reporter with our <i>Tmem8c</i><sup>LacZ/loxP</sup>; <i>Pax7</i><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This results in a ubiquitously expressed membrane-targeted tdTomato (mTom), but upon Cre-mediated recombination tdTomato is excised allowing membrane-GFP expression. These mice were subjected to MOV and assayed for the presence of mGFP<sup>+</sup> cells (MPs) using flow cytometry. We observed a non-significant reduction in mGFP<sup>+</sup> cells after MOV in myomaker scKO muscle (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We also performed immunostaining for Pax7, which revealed no major differences in SC number during MOV when normalized to fiber number (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results indicate that while there could be subtle alterations in SC dynamics, the myomaker scKO model does not significantly alter the frequency of muscle stem cells."

To exclude this possibility, we genetically deleted myomaker using a myofiber-specific Cre and assessed myomaker levels after MOV. Specifically, we crossed <i>Tmem8c</i><sup>LacZ/loxP</sup> mice with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre under control of the human skeletal actin promoter (<i>ACTA1</i><sup>CreERT2</sup>). We treated <i>Tmem8c</i><sup>LacZ/loxP</sup>; <i>ACTA1</i><sup>CreERT2</sup> mice with tamoxifen (myomaker mKO) for 5 days prior to MOV and analyzed myomaker transcript levels through qPCR analysis. If myomaker was transcribed from a myofiber nucleus in the presence of WT MPs, we would expect a reduction of myomaker levels in myomaker mKO muscle after MOV. However, myomaker mKO MOV plantaris did not exhibit a reduction in myomaker levels compared to control MOV, whereas a reduction was achieved in myomaker scKO MOV plantaris (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

Myomaker deletion in myomaker mKO mice was achieved only with maintenance of tamoxifen after MOV, likely because the human skeletal actin (<i>ACTA1</i>) promoter is activated as MPs differentiate and prior to fusion. Taken together, our results suggest the LacZ expression observed in control myofibers is acquired primarily from LacZ<sup>+</sup> MPs through fusion, and not from transcription by existing myofiber nuclei.

To ensure effective deletion of myomaker, control and myomaker scKO mice were subjected to five daily doses of tamoxifen prior to MOV, and kept on a tamoxifen regimen until sacrifice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Following 14 days of overload, evaluation of plantaris weight normalized to tibia length revealed a two-fold increase in control MOV compared to sham (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In contrast, myomaker scKO MOV plantaris was smaller than control MOV, although still increased above myomaker scKO sham weight (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Muscle responds to a load-induced stimulus by generating new myofibers and activating hypertrophic pathways in existing myofibers. Indeed, through histological examination of the plantaris after MOV, in control mice we observed an increase in myofiber size, a more direct evaluation of hypertrophy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This characteristic was not observed in myomaker scKO MOV plantaris sections, highlighting the importance of myomaker on MPs for efficient hypertrophy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Cross-sectional area (CSA) analysis of fiber size revealed an increase in control MOV compared to control sham (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In contrast, no differences were detected between myomaker scKO sham and MOV, indicating defective myofiber hypertrophy following MOV with genetic deletion of myomaker in MPs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In addition, frequency distribution analysis confirms the presence of fewer large myofibers in myomaker scKO muscles after overload (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Given that skeletal muscle is comprised of multiple different fiber types that have the capacity to dynamically adapt in response to physiological stimuli, we assessed if all fiber types were resistant to hypertrophy after loss of myomaker in SCs. We immunostained sections after 14 days of MOV with antibodies specific to Type I, Type IIa, and Type IIb myosin and quantified myofiber CSA for each fiber type. This analysis revealed no differences in fiber type frequency after MOV, and that genetic ablation of myomaker in SCs resulted in a lack of hypertrophy of Type IIa, IIb, and IIx myofibers (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We injected puromycin into control and myomaker scKO mice thirty minutes prior to sacrifice and assayed for puromycin incorporation into myofibers through immunostaining of muscle sections with a puromycin antibody (<a href=\"#bib14\">Goodman et al., 2011</a>). We also co-immunostained these sections with embryonic myosin (myh3) to evaluate the relative contribution of protein synthesis from de novo and existing myofibers. We observed minimal puromycin in sham samples, however in control muscle puromycin was elevated in both myh3<sup>-</sup> (existing) and myh3<sup>+</sup> (de novo) myofibers 7 days after MOV (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

While the mechanisms that govern ECM alterations during muscle hypertrophy and regeneration are relatively unknown, one aspect of this regulation is dependent on the presence of MPs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fry et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Murphy et al., 2011</a>). Thus, we sought to determine the consequence on ECM in fusion-defective muscle that is sensing increased load. We performed Masson\u2019s Trichrome staining on control and myomaker scKO sham and MOV muscle, which revealed modest fibrosis in control MOV, indicating that ECM remodeling is a normal process for hypertrophy (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In contrast, we observed an increase in fibrosis in the overloaded muscles of myomaker scKO mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Quantification of the fibrotic area indeed revealed a significant increase in fibrosis in myomaker scKO samples (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Consequently, the enhanced accumulation of ECM in myomaker scKO MOV muscle may explain the increase in muscle weight despite the lack of myofiber hypertrophy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This non-functional gain in muscle size illustrates that in place of de novo and larger myofibers, there is an increased formation of connective tissue in muscles with non-fused MPs, suggesting a protective role for fusion in stabilizing muscle architecture associated with increased workload."

Functional gains in adult muscle mass are derived from elevations in protein synthesis within the myofiber, and our findings highlight an additional source for muscle hypertrophy through the contributions of muscle stem cell fusion. Specifically, we use BrdU labeling and genetic lineage tracing approaches to evaluate the extent of fusion during overload-induced hypertrophy. While BrdU analysis revealed approximately 30% of fibers to undergo a fusion event, findings from the fluorescent reporter model demonstrate that the majority of myofibers fuse (mGFP<sup>+</sup>), indicating the BrdU strategy is an underestimation of the fusion process during muscle hypertrophy. We also reveal that in response to increased muscle workload, myomaker is primarily upregulated in activated SCs, which is required for fusion with a myofiber. In the absence of SC-derived myomaker, the activation of pro-hypertrophic signaling pathways and protein synthesis, and increases in myofiber size and number are diminished. Thus, myomaker-mediated fusion is required for load-induced hypertrophy of skeletal muscle."

Indeed, blunting of hypertrophy was observed after elimination of satellite cells through gamma irradiation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2002</a>) or through genetic manipulation of IL-6-dependent effects on SC/MP activity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guerci et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Serrano et al., 2008</a>). However, two independent groups utilized DTA-mediated ablation of SCs and produced widely contrasting results. The initial SC DTA experiments indicated that SCs are not necessary for hypertrophy, where CSA was increased 10% in control mice with normal SC activity. (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fry et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">McCarthy et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, a recent report also using ablation of SCs through DTA provides evidence that muscles fail to undergo overload-induced hypertrophy in the absence of SCs, and this study reported a 26% increase of CSA in control mice (<a href=\"#bib10\">Egner et al., 2016</a>). While the interpretation of these two studies are vastly different, the magnitude of hypertrophy achieved, which is best assessed through CSA analysis and not gross muscle weights, is not similar and may account for the divergent outcomes. The magnitude of CSA increase in our study was 29% in control mice after MOV, which is more similar to the work by Egner et al. We also observed an approximate 10% CSA increase in myomaker scKO MOV samples compared to myomaker scKO sham. Although this increase was not significant it suggests that myofibers harbor a minor hypertrophic potential in the absence of fusion consistent with Fry et al. Through generation of fusion-defective SCs however, we provide independent evidence for the necessity of SCs for any major muscle hypertrophy."

During compensatory hypertrophy, newly acquired myonuclei precede muscle hypertrophy (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bruusgaard et al., 2010</a>). Thus, fusion may provide new nuclei to facilitate enhanced transcription of contractile proteins necessary for hypertrophy, as supported by our findings that myofibers are not able to activate protein synthesis in the absence of fusion. Addition of a new nucleus to the myofiber may also function to maintain a constant myonuclear domain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Moss and Leblond, 1970</a>), however this concept has been challenged especially during postnatal muscle development (<a href=\"#bib46\">White et al., 2010</a>). Alternatively, fusion may not only provide new nuclei but also other factors necessary for hypertrophy, such as ribosomes for protein translation, or a bolus of signaling molecules to activate hypertrophic pathways similar to the activation of Akt by Wnt7a (<a href=\"#bib45\">von Maltzahn et al., 2012</a>).

IGF-1 directly activates the Akt pathway (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rommel et al., 2001</a>) while myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle mass through SMAD-dependent inhibition of Akt (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sartori et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Trendelenburg et al., 2009</a>). The inability for muscle to initiate Akt/mTOR signaling without myomaker expression in myogenic progenitors was surprising since previous studies have shown that myofibers have the ability to intrinsically activate this canonical protein synthesis pathway (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bodine et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lai et al., 2004</a>). Indeed, SC activation is not observed during muscle hypertrophy induced through a constitutively active Akt transgene (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blaauw et al., 2009</a>), or inhibition of myostatin action by pharmacological blockade of its receptor ACVR2B (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). It is conceivable that during overload-induced hypertrophy, the increased tension placed on the myofiber requires SC-mediated activity for hypertrophy, whereas there is an absence of mechanical strain on the myofiber through treatment with IGF-1 or ACVR2B antibody. The ultimate goal of muscle hypertrophy is to increase contractile capability to deal with heightened physiological demands. Hypertrophy associated with loss of myostatin may not yield long-term improvements in muscle function suggesting that addition of myonuclei are necessary for functional hypertrophic gains (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gundersen, 2016</a>).

After overload of myomaker scKO mice, MPs are still present in muscle, suggesting the major reason for fibrosis can be attributed to an inability to maintain myofiber integrity due to loss of SC activity. It is formally possible that MPs lacking myomaker are not only fusion-defective but also lack an ability to communicate with fibroblasts through paracrine signaling. However, given that no evidence exists supporting this possibility, and that we observed significant fusion during MOV, our data are more consistent with a model where fibrosis occurs in myomaker scKO MOV muscles due to an inability to repair myofiber mechanical strain. This model of myofiber mechanical strain eliciting fibrosis is not unlike what occurs in other contexts, such as in cardiac muscle subjected to pressure overload where fibrosis functions to maintain tissue architecture (<a href=\"#bib7\">Creemers and Pinto, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Teekakirikul et al., 2012</a>)."

However, 10 days after MOV the number of LacZ<sup>+</sup> cells was comparable between control and myomaker scKO muscle, suggesting that accumulated LacZ<sup>+</sup> fusion-defective cells die between day 7 and day 10 of MOV or that myomaker is down-regulated and they become LacZ<sup>-</sup>. Analysis of MPs using a genetic reporter (mGFP) found no dramatic difference in the percentage of mGFP<sup>+</sup> cells between control and myomaker scKO MOV samples. These inconsistencies highlight the current lack of knowledge regarding fusion-defective MPs. It is possible that the LacZ<sup>+</sup> cells represent a small fraction of MPs and not enough to shift the percentage of mGFP<sup>+</sup> MPs analyzed through flow cytometry. Also, since mGFP<sup>+</sup> MPs are expressed as a percentage of the total cell population, changes in non-MP populations could indirectly alter the mGFP<sup>+</sup> percentage.

Following 1 hr of incubation with a secondary Alexa Fluor antibody (1:200) (Invitrogen), slides were mounted with VectaShield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). For assessment of hypertrophy, samples were stained with anti-laminin (1:100; Sigma-Aldrich # L9393), and representative non-overlapping images from all sections were captured at 20x on a Nikon A1R confocal system. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of myofibers was quantified through a binary thresholding algorithm developed in Imaris (Bitplane). Whole section images were also taken at 10x, and the total number of myofibers per muscle section was determined through an automated image segmentation program from ImageJ. To assay for fusion, samples were co-stained with anti-BrdU (1:20; Roche #11170376001) and anti-dystrophin (1:100; Abcam #ab15277). The following antibodies from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank were also used: Pax7 (1:50), myh7 (1:100; clone BA-D5), myh2 (1:100; clone SC-71), myh4 (1:10; clone BF-F3), and myh3 (1:10; clone F1.652).

Identical settings were utilized to capture mGFP and mTomato fluorescent images from all fibers and then processed in ImageJ. Fibers isolated from vehicle-treated mice were used to establish an impartial baseline for auto-fluorescence, and the threshold for GFP intensity was set at a constant value.

The authors use state-of-the-art genetic systems, including conditional myomaker alleles to achieve SC-specific deletion of myomaker (myomaker<sup>scKO</sup>) in adult mice. They show that with these animals, in which SCs and their progeny are unable to fuse, overload-induced hypertrophy is blunted, indicating a role for SC fusion in mounting an optimal hypertrophic response. They substantiate this conclusion using additional BrdU molecular tracking and a color-switching genetic lineage tracing strategies, which further demonstrate the contribution and requirement of myomaker-mediated stem cell fusion for skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Finally, the authors provide data indicating a reduction of Akt signaling, a pathway known for eliciting muscle hypertrophy, in myomaker scKO MOV muscles following fusion-blockade (although this aspect of the work remains rather preliminary, see below)."

Is there evidence of lacz<sup>+</sup> (or lacz<sup>-</sup>) muscle progenitor cell apoptosis during this interval, or are the cells simply shutting down expression of myomaker? Clarification of this point is important for interpreting the results, and could be obtained by (<a href=\"#bib1\">1</a>) an analysis of lacz<sup>+</sup> MP apoptosis rates at multiple time points after MOV (days 3, 7, 10 and 14) and (<a href=\"#bib2\">2</a>) analysis of MP cell number and apoptosis rates at additional time points after MOV using the mTmG model, in which cells are permanently marked with GFP, so should be trackable regardless of whether they downregulate myomaker. Relatedly, an inherent assumption in the authors' discussion of contrasting results in the DTA ablation model versus myomaker deletion model is that myomaker deletion does not affect the frequency of muscle stem cells (satellite cells) in MOV muscles; however, this is not demonstrated directly. The authors should quantify satellite cell numbers in scKO versus control MOV muscles to directly evaluate effects of myomaker loss in the MOV model on maintenance of muscle regenerative cells."

To deal with this issue we sought to delineate the myogenic state of these LacZ<sup>+</sup> cells through determining whether these cells were myh3<sup>+</sup> (embryonic myosin), a known marker for differentiated myocytes. Through staining of day 7 MOV serial sections with either x-gal or myh3 we were able to classify the LacZ<sup>+</sup> structures.

We interpret these cells to be existing myofibers that have fused with a LacZ<sup>+</sup> MP, and the reason for the punctate LacZ is that after fusion LacZ diffuses throughout the large myofiber."

Muscle weights directly measure all components of the tissue, including myofibers, ECM, and immune cell infiltration and do not directly evaluate myofiber size. Moreover, since we remove two-thirds of the gastrocnemius during MOV, it is difficult to reliably dissect the plantaris away from the remaining gastrocnemius. This phenomenon could lead to the disparity between muscle weights and CSA, and reinforces that muscle weights should not be used as a proxy for hypertrophy.
