Here we show that in <i>Trypanosoma congolense</i> this receptor is instead expressed in the epimastigote developmental stage that occurs in the tsetse fly, where it acts as a haemoglobin receptor. We also present the structure of the <i>T. congolense</i> receptor in complex with haemoglobin. This allows us to propose an evolutionary history for this receptor, charting the structural and cellular changes that took place as it adapted from a role in the insect to a new role in the mammalian host."

Here we show that in <i>Trypanosoma congolense</i> this receptor is instead expressed in the epimastigote developmental stage that occurs in the tsetse fly, where it acts as a haemoglobin receptor. We also present the structure of the <i>T. congolense</i> receptor in complex with haemoglobin. This allows us to propose an evolutionary history for this receptor, charting the structural and cellular changes that took place as it adapted from a role in the insect to a new role in the mammalian host."

A technique called X-ray crystallography was used to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the <i>T. congolense</i> receptor and haemoglobin in fine detail.

While all share some common features, including antigenic variation and transmission by the tsetse fly, one of the most obvious differences between species is variation in the developmental cycle in the fly (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hoare, 1972</a>) and in particular the location of the epimastigote developmental stage. <i>T. brucei</i> epimastigotes attach to the epithelium in the salivary glands away from the digestive tract, whereas <i>T. congolense</i> and <i>T. vivax</i> attach in the proboscis within the digestive tract (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hoare, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Peacock et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jefferies et al., 1987</a>).

The density of packing of the VSG molecules on the surface of the bloodstream form trypanosome is thought to approach the maximum possible (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gr\u00fcnfelder et al., 2002</a>).

In humans and some other primates, TbHpHbR also plays a role in innate immunity. Human serum contains two complexes, trypanolytic factors-1 and -2 (TLF1 and TLF2), which cause trypanosome lysis (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rifkin, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hajduk et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tomlinson et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Raper et al., 1996</a>).

The N-terminal domain of TbHpHbR is formed from an extended three \u03b1-helical bundle with a small, membrane-distal head, and is attached to the plasma membrane by a glycophosphatidylinosotol-anchor at the C-terminus of a small C-terminal domain. HpHb binds along the membrane-distal half of the helical bundle. A striking feature of this helical bundle is a ~50\u00b0 kink, which lies between the HpHb binding site and the membrane attachment point. This kink is likely to result in separation of the VSG molecules on either side of the receptor, holding them apart and presenting the HpHb binding site to the extracellular environment. It also allows two receptors to contact a single HpHb dimer, allowing greater avidity for the ligand and more efficient uptake into trypanosomes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lane-Serff et al., 2014</a>). Specificity for HpHb results from direct, simultaneous contact between the receptor and both haptoglobin and the \u03b2-subunit of haemoglobin. Neither isolated haemoglobin nor haptoglobin binds significantly (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</a>). In addition, the propionate chains of haem directly contact the receptor and contribute to binding, with a significant reduction in binding affinity for HpHb that lacks haem (<a href=\"#bib46\">St\u00f8dkilde et al., 2014</a>). Therefore TbHpHbR has evolved specific adaptations to function in the context of the VSG layer and to selectively bind to haem-loaded HpHb complexes."

Mutagenesis studies showed that TcHpHbR and TbHpHbR use overlapping binding sites to interact with HpHb (<a href=\"#bib19\">Higgins et al., 2013</a>). The structure of TcHpHbR has a similar architecture to TbHpHbR, with a long three \u03b1-helical bundle and small membrane-distal head. However, one striking difference is that the helical bundle of TcHpHbR lacks the kink found in TbHpHbR. With the kink suggested to play a critical role in the operation of TbHpHbR in the context of the VSG layer, it was surprising that TcHpHbR lacks this evolutionary adaption if it too operates in a similar, densely packed environment. For this reason, we set out to investigate the structure and function of the <i>T. congolense</i> HpHbR, to understand its ligand binding specificity, its site of action and the evolutionary adaptations undergone by haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptors from different species."

This interface is more hydrophobic in nature than the membrane-distal site. However, once again, the propionate chains of haem directly interact with the receptor. This membrane distal binding site is distinct in position and chemical nature from the region of TbHpHbR that contacts haptoglobin, which is closer to the membrane surface and is smaller (~505 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>). The more extensive contact site between TcHpHbR and the \u03b2-subunit of Hb, than that between TbHpHbR and Hp, is likely to be a major contributor to the increased affinity of TcHpHbR for Hb."

To understand the molecular basis for this interaction, we generated a model of the TcHpHbR:HpHb complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). One surprise from a comparison of the TcHpHbR:Hb structure with that of TbHpHbR:HpHb is that the membrane distal binding site of TcHpHbR interacts with the Hb \u03b1-subunit while the equivalent site of TbHpHbR interacts with the Hb \u03b2-subunit of HpHb. We modeled the TcHpHbR:HpHb structure by docking either Hb subunit from the structure of HpHb onto the interacting Hb \u03b1-subunit of the TcHpHbR:Hb complex. When the Hb \u03b1-subunit is docked onto the membrane-distal binding site, Hp makes no contacts with the receptor. In contrast, when the HpHb is \u2018flipped\u2019 so that the Hb \u03b2-subunit contacts the membrane-distal binding site, this positions Hp adjacent to the receptor (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In addition, the residues from the Hb \u03b1-subunit that contact the membrane-distal binding site are replaced by chemically similar residues in the Hb \u03b2-subunit, allowing equivalent interactions to occur. The interaction between TbHpHbR and Hp is predominantly hydrophobic in nature, and a similar, but smaller, hydrophobic region in TcHpHbR, involving phenylalanine 48 is similarly positioned to interact with Hp. We therefore predict that HpHb interacts with TcHpHbR with a similar binding mode to that observed in the TbHpHbR:HpHb complex with the Hb \u03b2-subunit contacting the membrane-distal binding site, allowing haptoglobin to bind to a membrane-proximal site."

This change in the helical pathway could be a consequence of the adoption of a kink in TbHpHbR, which allows the receptor to function in the context of the VSG layer.

This receptor also mediates uptake of trypanolytic factor-1 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</a>) and to a lesser extent the uptake of trypanolytic factor-2 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bullard et al., 2012</a>), contributing to the inability of most isolates of <i>T. brucei</i> to survive in human serum. It was a reasonable expectation that orthologues in other African trypanosome species, such as <i>T. congolense</i> and <i>T. vivax</i>, would have a similar function. However, here it is shown that there are significant differences between the receptors from <i>T. brucei</i> and <i>T. congolense</i>. Firstly, <i>T. congolense</i> HpHbR has an approximately 1000-fold greater affinity for haemoglobin than for haptoglobin-haemoglobin and developmental forms expressing TcHpHbR are able to internalise Hb at low nanomolar concentrations. Secondly, the <i>T. congolense</i> receptor is expressed in the epimastigotes with a copy number approximately 1000-fold greater than that of <i>T. brucei</i> HpHbR in the bloodstream form. Finally, <i>T. congolense</i> HpHbR is distributed over the whole cell surface, whereas in <i>T. brucei</i> it is concentrated in the flagellar pocket (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</a>). Similar findings are seen for <i>T. vivax</i>, as TvHpHbR also binds haemoglobin preferentially over haptoglobin-haemoglobin and is, at the mRNA level, preferentially expressed in epimastigotes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jackson et al., 2015</a>). This, together with the evolutionary history of the trypanosomes, suggests that the receptors from <i>T. vivax</i> and <i>T. congolense</i> represent the ancestral form, while the <i>T. brucei</i> receptor has adopted a modified function and cellular distribution."

The presence of TcHpHbR will allow epimastigotes to scavenge haem that is present in haemoglobin molecules released from lysed erythrocytes, or to bind more weakly to haptoglobin-haemoglobin. It is noteworthy that the predominant form of bovine haptoglobin adopts higher order multimers more complex than the dimeric HpHb used in this study (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lai et al., 2007</a>) and it is possible that this may increase the avidity for TcHpHbR, as observed for multimeric human HpHb binding to scavenger receptor CD163 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kristiansen et al., 2001</a>), making uptake of HpHb more efficient. Endocytosis of TcHpHbR bound to either Hb or HpHb would then provide the parasite with haem."

This is approximately 1000-fold greater than the level of TbHpHbR in the bloodstream form (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Drain et al., 2001</a>). One possible explanation for this abundant expression is that the receptor must capture haemoglobin as it periodically and transiently flows over the cell surface when the blood meal passes through the tsetse fly mouthparts. This is in contrast with TbHpHbR expressed in the <i>T. brucei</i> bloodstream stage, which will be constantly exposed to its ligand. It remains unknown how <i>T. congolense</i> bloodstream forms acquire haem. It may be that sufficient haptoglobin-haemoglobin enters the cell through fluid phase endocytosis or perhaps through an alternative receptor, such as the ortholog of the LHR1 haem transpoter utilized by <i>Leishmania amazonensis</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huynh et al., 2012</a>)."

First, perhaps to evade toxic components of the blood meal or to avoid niche competition with other trypanosome species in the proboscis, the developmental cycle of <i>T. brucei</i> altered, with the epimastigotes adopting a new location in the salivary glands, rather than developing in the mouthparts. As no haemoglobin is available from bloodmeals in the salivary glands, the receptor became redundant. A new pattern of expression then evolved in which the receptor was expressed in bloodstream forms instead of in epimastigotes. This switch conferred the ability to more efficiently acquire haem more efficiently in the bloodstream form. That this provides an advantage is evidenced by the attenuation of growth of a TbHpHbR null mutant in a mouse model (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</a>). However, free haemoglobin is not normally present in blood, where it rapidly assembles into HpHb complexes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wada et al., 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Deiss and Lee, 1999</a>). Evolutionary changes therefore took place in TbHpHbR that resulted in an increase in its affinity for HpHb, from 8\u2009\u03bcM in <i>T. congolense</i> to 1 \u00b5M in <i>T. brucei</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Higgins et al., 2013</a>). A decrease in expression levels and a change in primary location from the cell surface to being concentrated in the flagellar pocket (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</a>) was most likely a final adaptation, perhaps driven by the need to avoid detection by the mammalian acquired immune system."

                        "text": "The change in the developmental stage of expression also had significant effects on the structure of the receptor. On the epimastigote surface, TcHpHbR is free to interact with its ligand relatively unimpeded by other surface proteins. In addition, with a 3 nM affinity for Hb, monovalent binding will allow efficient uptake, and simple tilting of the receptor around its GPI-anchor will position the binding site to allow simultaneous binding of two receptors to one Hb if required (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). A switch to expression in the bloodstream form forced the receptor to function within the densely packed VSG layer. In addition, switching to a ligand with approximately 1000-fold weaker binding made bivalent binding important for efficient uptake. To operate in this new context, the <i>T. brucei</i> receptor evolved by gaining both a novel C-terminal domain that probably increases the distance of the ligand binding site from the plasma membrane and by evolving a significant kink between the ligand-binding site and the membrane surface (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lane-Serff et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">St\u00f8dkilde et al., 2014</a>). This kink pushes the VSG molecules apart and presents the ligand-binding site at the surface. It also allows two receptors, both coupled to the membrane surface, to simultaneously bind to a single dimer of haptoglobin-haemoglobin, increasing avidity and uptake efficiency. A consequence of these changes was the loss of haemoglobin binding, which was no longer under positive selection."

For each cycle, biotinylated recombinant receptor was immobilised on a CAP chip using the Biotin CAPture Kit (GE Healthcare) to a total loading of ~250 RU. Binding partners were injected for 240\u2009s with a dissociation time of 300\u2009s. The chip was regenerated between cycles using regeneration solution from the Biotin CAPture Kit. The specific binding response of the ligands to receptors was determined by subtracting the response given by Hb or HpHb from a surface to which no receptor had been coupled. As both Hb and HpHb have the capacity to simultaneously interact with two receptors, this data was not fitted to obtain affinity measurements."

Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis showed the <i>T. congolense</i> and <i>T. vivax</i> HpHbR bound both HpHb and Hb but formed a far more stable complex with Hb alone. Based on these observations, the authors suggest that this receptor is tailored for the epimastigote forms to scavenge haemoglobin in the fly. Consistent with a role in the insect vector they found that the HpHbR is not expressed in bloodstream forms but rather in the epimastigote stage found attached to the proboscis. Further, based on IFA and western blot analysis they predict greater than 5 X 105 receptors distributed rather uniformly across the cell surface. Analysis of the structure of the TcHpHbR with bound Hb provided a clear understanding of the features that mediate this high affinity receptor-ligand interaction."

We describe this experiment as it was the observation that led to our discovery that TcHpHbR is an Hb receptor, rather than to imply that TcHpHR will disassemble HpHb as part of its physiological function. As the reviewers rightly point out, the HpSPHb used in this experiment is not identical to native HpHb complex, as native Hp is cleaved into \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains. While structural alignments show that this does not affect the position of residues involved in the interaction with the haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptors, it does alter the interface between Hp and Hb and could change the stability of the HpHb complex. We therefore performed the experiment suggested by the reviewers in which we incubated HpHb with TcHpHbR, and in this case we do not see disassembly of the HpHb. However, neither do we see the formation of a TcHpHbR:HpHb complex with sufficient stability to survive gel filtration chromatography. This is in contrast to what occurs when we mix TcHpHbR with Hb, when a stable complex is formed. This data is now presented in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>.

This comment was stimulated by the higher molecular weight of the antibody reactive band in the epimastigotes when compared with recombinant protein. In the absence of an epimastigote form of a <i>T. congolense</i> HpHbR<sup>-/-</sup> cell line, we tested this using <i>T. brucei</i> TbHpHbR<sup>-/-</sup> bloodstream forms carrying an inducible copy of a TcHpHbR transgene. Upon induction with doxycycline, the antisera detected two bands that again ran at a higher molecular weight than the recombinant TcHpHbR. This data is presented in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and shows that a fraction of <i>T. brucei</i> expressed TcHpHbR runs in the same position as the antibody-reactive band in the epimastigotes. This difference in mobility is probably due to differential modification of GPI-anchors in the bloodstream and insect cell stages of <i>T. brucei</i>. The insect stages are modified with sialic acid residues whereas the bloodstream forms, used here for the transgene expression, are not. In conjunction with our new data showing haemoglobin uptake into <i>T. congolense</i> epimastigotes, this gives strong support to our conclusion that TcHpHbR is expressed in epimastigotes."

This adaptation might allow the parasite to acquire sufficient haem during its time in the tsetse fly, but an experimental demonstration of this will be challenging.
