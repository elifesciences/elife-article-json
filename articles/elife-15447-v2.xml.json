                    "text": "How cells sense their mechanical environment and transduce forces into biochemical signals is a crucial yet unresolved question in mechanobiology. Platelets use receptor glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), specifically its \u03b1 subunit (GPIb\u03b1), to signal as they tether and translocate on von Willebrand factor (VWF) of injured arterial surfaces against blood flow. Force elicits catch bonds to slow VWF\u2013GPIb\u03b1 dissociation and unfolds the GPIb\u03b1 leucine-rich repeat domain (LRRD) and juxtamembrane mechanosensitive domain (MSD). How these mechanical processes trigger biochemical signals remains unknown. Here we analyze these extracellular events and the resulting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> on a single platelet in real time, revealing that LRRD unfolding intensifies Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal whereas MSD unfolding affects the type of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Therefore, LRRD and MSD are analog and digital force transducers, respectively. The &gt;30 nm macroglycopeptide separating the two domains transmits force on the VWF\u2013GPIb\u03b1 bond (whose lifetime is prolonged by LRRD unfolding) to the MSD to enhance its unfolding, resulting in unfolding cooperativity at an optimal force. These elements may provide design principles for a generic mechanosensory protein machine."

                    "text": "How cells sense their mechanical environment and transduce forces into biochemical signals is a crucial yet unresolved question in mechanobiology. Platelets use receptor glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), specifically its \u03b1 subunit (GPIb\u03b1), to signal as they tether and translocate on von Willebrand factor (VWF) of injured arterial surfaces against blood flow. Force elicits catch bonds to slow VWF\u2013GPIb\u03b1 dissociation and unfolds the GPIb\u03b1 leucine-rich repeat domain (LRRD) and juxtamembrane mechanosensitive domain (MSD). How these mechanical processes trigger biochemical signals remains unknown. Here we analyze these extracellular events and the resulting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> on a single platelet in real time, revealing that LRRD unfolding intensifies Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal whereas MSD unfolding affects the type of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Therefore, LRRD and MSD are analog and digital force transducers, respectively. The &gt;30 nm macroglycopeptide separating the two domains transmits force on the VWF\u2013GPIb\u03b1 bond (whose lifetime is prolonged by LRRD unfolding) to the MSD to enhance its unfolding, resulting in unfolding cooperativity at an optimal force. These elements may provide design principles for a generic mechanosensory protein machine."

                        "text": "Platelets can\u00a0serve\u00a0as a natural model system for studying cell mechanosensing as they rapidly respond to changes in hydrodynamic forces and substrate stiffness due to vascular pathology (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jackson, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Qiu et al., 2015</a>). Previous studies have suggested the role of GPIb\u03b1 as a mechanoreceptor, for force exerted on it via its ligand VWF induces platelet signaling (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ruggeri, 2015</a>). Conceptually, this coupled mechanical-biochemical process (mechanosensing) can be broken down into four steps: 1) Mechanopresentation: the receptor binding domain A1 is exposed by structural changes in VWF induced by elongational flow and collagen immobilization (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ju et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Springer, 2014</a>); 2) Mechanoreception: GPIb\u03b1 LRRD receives the force signal via engaging VWF-A1 to tether the platelet against shear stress; 3) Mechanotransmission: force is propagated from the LRRD through the mucin-like macroglycopeptide (MP) stalk (cf.\u00a0Figure\u00a02A)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Fox et al., 1988</a>) and the MSD across the membrane to adaptor and signaling molecules (e.g. 14-3-3\u03b6) inside the platelet\u00a0(cf.\u00a0Figure\u00a07G); and 4) Mechanotransduction: force induces mechano-chemical changes to convert mechanical cues to biochemical signals. Some of these steps have been characterized separately. For example, GPIb\u03b1 forms catch-slip bonds with wild-type (WT) A1 in &gt;15\u00a0pN, such that the bond lifetime first increases with force, reaches a maximum at ~25\u00a0pN, and decreases thereafter; whereas it forms slip-only bonds with type 2B von Willebrand disease (VWD) mutant (e.g. A1R1450E), such that the bond lifetime decreases monotonically with force (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ju et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yago et al., 2008</a>). As another example, force induces unfolding of the LRRD, which prolongs A1\u2013GPIb\u03b1 bond lifetime (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ju et al., 2015b</a>), and of the MSD, which is hypothesized to play a role in platelet signaling (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). However, how these inter-connected steps are orchestrated to enable the information encoded by force to be translated into biochemical signals is still poorly understood."

By manipulating the mechanopresentation and mechanoreception steps then analyzing the resulting mechanotransmission and mechanotransduction steps, we gained insights into the inner workings of this GPIb\u03b1-mediated mechanosensory machine."

Two zoom-in platelet signaling scenarios are inserted following a short- and\u00a0a long-lived VWF\u2013GPIb\u03b1 bond respectively.

The ramped unfolding frequencies of both domains were extremely low at \u226410\u00a0pN but increased with the higher levels of clamped forces (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Interestingly, LRRD, but not MSD, unfolded more frequently when platelet GPIb\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and GC (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) were pulled by A1WT than A1R1450E. The ramped unfolding forces of both domains increased with the clamped force and were indifferent to whether force was applied via WT or R1450E mutant of A1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). In general, a higher force was required to unfold LRRD than MSD. Surprisingly, pulling platelet GPIb\u03b1 via different ligands generated distinctive MSD clamped unfolding frequency vs. force plots: increasing initially and decreasing after reaching maximal at 25\u00a0pN when pulled by A1WT, but decreasing monotonically when pulled by A1R1450E (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These data suggest that the mechanoreceptor GPIb\u03b1 may be able to interpret mechanical cues and discriminate ligands by responding to different force waveforms applied via different ligands with distinct LRRD and MSD unfolding frequencies. In addition, the distinctive force-dependences of two subpopulations of events that we deemed as respective LRRD and MSD unfolding provide further support for our criteria for their identification and classification."

This hypothesis predicts that the probability for LRRD and MSD to unfold concurrently should be equal to the product of the respective probabilities for LRRD and MSD to unfold separately. To test this hypothesis, we estimated these probabilities from the observed unfolding occurrence frequencies. At 25\u00a0pN, the 34.5% of BFP force-clamp cycles with unfolding events consist of 7.6, 17.2, 6.9, and 2.8% of unfolding of LRRD alone, MSD alone, LRRD and MSD sequentially, and concurrently (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1A</a>). Significantly, the frequency of observing both LRRD and MSD unfolding in the same binding cycle, calculated by pooling together both cases of two domains unfolding sequentially and concurrently, <i>P</i>(MSD+LRRD), is much higher than the product of their respective occurrence frequencies, <i>P</i>(MSD)\u00d7<i>P</i>(LRRD), which is the joint probability for both to unfold assuming that they were independent (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1B</a>)."

                                "text": "To elucidate the mechanism underlying the force- and ligand-dependent unfolding cooperativity, we note that when the MSD unfolding events were separately analyzed according to their occurrence in the ramping or clamping phase, MSD clamped, but not ramped, unfolding was significantly (p=\u00a08.79\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u20133</sup> vs. 0.076 at 25\u00a0pN) enhanced by LRRD unfolding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), which occurred in the ramping phase only. This dominance of cooperativity by sequential rather than concurrent unfolding suggests a model for LRRD unfolding to impact MSD unfolding, which includes three ideas. The first idea has to do with the MSD time-to-unfold, <i>t</i><sub>u</sub> (cf. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Our force-clamp measurements revealed similar <i>t</i><sub>u</sub> values induced by A1WT or A1R1450E pulling (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The only exception is at 10\u00a0pN where a shorter <i>t</i><sub>u</sub> was induced by A1WT than A1R1450E. This can be explained by their differential bond lifetimes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Compared to A1R1450E, the much shorter lifetime of GPIb\u03b1 bond with A1WT at 10\u00a0pN may underestimate <i>t</i><sub>u</sub> because early dissociation of GPIb\u03b1 would prevent observation of slow MSD unfolding events. This reasoning provides the second idea for our model: MSD clamped unfolding should occur before A1\u2013GPIb\u03b1 dissociation. The third idea comes from our previous observation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ju et al., 2015b</a>) that LRRD unfolding significantly prolongs GPIb\u03b1 bond lifetime with A1WT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) but not A1R1450E (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Combining these three ideas, our model proposes that the A1\u2013GPIb\u03b1 bond lifetime, regulated by force and prolonged by LRRD unfolding in respective ligand-specific manners, determines the occurrence of MSD clamped unfolding, which, despite its ligand-independent unfolding kinetics, generates a cooperativity pattern that maximizes at the optimal force of 25\u00a0pN for A1WT but not for A1R1450E."

Using the normalized maximum calcium intensity \u0394<i>I</i><sub>max</sub> to represent the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, we compared its correlations with three statistics of A1WT\u2013GPIb\u03b1 bond lifetimes occurred prior to calcium onset. We found that\u00a0\u0394<i>I</i><sub>max</sub> correlates best with the pre-Ca<sup>2+</sup> longest bond lifetime <i>t</i><sub>max</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), similarly well with the pre-Ca<sup>2+</sup> cumulative lifetime \u2211<i>t</i><sub>i</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), but poorly with the pre-Ca<sup>2+</sup> average lifetime &lt;<i>t</i>&gt; (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Careful examination of many overlaid calcium and bond lifetime traces, as exemplified in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, revealed that the \u2211<i>t</i><sub>i</sub> values are generally dominated by the <i>t</i><sub>max</sub> values, which are usually much longer than the rest of the pre-Ca<sup>2+</sup> bond lifetimes and are immediately followed by the calcium onset before observing additional shorter bond lifetimes. In other words, for each platelet usually \u2211<i>t</i><sub>i</sub> could be approximated by <i>t</i><sub>max</sub> but &lt;<i>t</i>&gt; is of a smaller and variable value. This observation explains why calcium correlates equally well with <i>t</i><sub>max</sub> and \u2211<i>t</i><sub>i</sub> but not with &lt;<i>t</i>&gt;. Importantly, these results also suggest that a single long-lived GPIb\u03b1 bond is sufficient to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a platelet. This assertion has been further supported by the parallel analysis of the data for A1R1450E. Although for R1450E the <i>t</i><sub>max</sub> value was significantly shorter and the \u03b1-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> population was greatly reduced, the \u0394<i>I</i><sub>max</sub> still showed similar correlation with <i>t</i><sub>max</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Thus the pre-Ca<sup>2+</sup> longest bond lifetime correlates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> strength and type."

We first performed force-ramp experiment to generate a wide range of rupture forces using three ramping rates: 100, 1000 and 10,000 pN/s. However, only low levels of \u03b2-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0were resulted (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), showing no correlation with the largest rupture force prior to calcium onset (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>, right ordinate), regardless of whether platelets were tested by A1WT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>) or A1R1450E (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,D</a>). In sharp contrast, much higher levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> of \u03b1- and \u03b2-types were induced by clamped forces applied to GPIb\u03b1 via either A1WT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,G</a>) or A1R1450E (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,H</a>) despite their much lower levels than the rupture forces seen in the force-ramp experiments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Concurrently, the longest of A1\u2013GPIb\u03b1 bond lifetimes\u00a0that\u00a0occurred prior to Ca<sup>2+</sup> onset was measured on each platelet and averaged over all platelets in each group. This pre-Ca<sup>2+</sup> longest bond lifetime, <i>t</i><sub>max</sub>, exhibited catch-slip bond behavior for A1WT and slip-only bond behavior for A1R1450E (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>, right ordinate), just as the corresponding average bond lifetimes previously measured regardless of the intraplatelet calcium (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ju et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yago et al., 2008</a>). Remarkably, the force-dependent pattern of calcium signals matched that of the pre-Ca<sup>2+</sup> longest bond lifetimes for both A1WT and A1R1450E. The ligand-independent positive correlation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal with <i>t</i><sub>max</sub> is consistent with a previously observed inverse correlation between the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level and the translocation velocity of platelets on immobilized VWF (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nesbitt et al., 2002</a>). This is expected because the platelet translocation velocity is an inverse metric of VWF\u2013GPIb\u03b1 bond lifetime (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ju et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yago et al., 2008</a>)."

To investigate the role of 14-3-3\u03b6 in GPIb\u03b1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, we perturbed the system with a myristoylated peptide (MP\u03b1C) that mimics the 14-3-3\u03b6 binding sequence of GPIb\u03b1, thereby blocking the association of 14-3-3\u03b6 with GPIb\u03b1 cytoplasmic tail. Consistent with the previously reported signaling inhibition effect (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Yin et al., 2013</a>), MP\u03b1C reduced the fraction of \u03b1-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> from 34 to 3% without affecting \u03b2-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>, whereas a scramble peptide M\u03b1Csc had no effect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Similar results were obtained by pulling GPIb\u03b1 via WM23 on\u00a0platelets\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Thus, GPIb\u201314-3-3\u03b6 association, a biochemical event, is crucial for the transduction of MSD unfolding, a mechanical event, into intracellular signals. These observations indicate that GPIb\u201314-3-3\u03b6 serves, at least in part, as a mechanotransducer (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>)."

Thus, pulling a single GPIb\u03b1 by a 25\u00a0pN force for &gt;2\u00a0s to unfold MSD once is necessary and sufficient to induce \u03b1-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. By comparison, to trigger calcium in a na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte requires a sequence of intermittent bonds with a total of &gt;10\u00a0s lifetimes under 10\u00a0pN accumulated in the first 60\u00a0s of contacts between T cell receptors and agonist peptide-major histocompatibility complex molecules (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). In both cases a threshold of force duration is required, as ramped forces without a clamp phase are unable to trigger appreciable levels of \u03b1-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0regardless of its magnitude."

A recent study has shown a type 2B mutation, A1V1316M, causes additional signaling defects (<a href=\"#bib5\">Casari et al., 2013</a>). We showed that another type 2B mutation, A1R1450E, also has signaling defect. Interestingly, the defect to induce calcium has the same root as the binding defect, namely, the conversion of the wild-type catch-slip bond to the mutant slip-only bond (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ju et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yago et al., 2008</a>). Consequently, force exerted on GPIb\u03b1 by A1R1450E is less able to unfold LRRD, lasts shorter at 25\u00a0pN to unfold MSD less frequently, does not generate unbinding cooperativity between the LRRD and MSD, and induces lower level and frequency of \u03b1-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> at &gt;10\u00a0pN. Thus, the mechanical requirements for signal induction manifest as force-dependencies of VWF\u2013GPIb\u03b1 bond lifetime, MSD unfolding frequency, unfolding cooperativity, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> level/type that display similar patterns for the same A1 construct (WT or R1450E) but different patterns between A1WT and A1R1450E. These findings show that the GPIb\u03b1 mechanoreceptor can discriminate ligands and shed light to the biophysical mechanisms of type 2B VWD."

By residing in the juxtamembrane stalk region, the MSD has been shown to be mechanosensitive, and hypothesized to play a role in activating platelets (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). In the present work, we found that MSD unfolding is required to trigger \u03b1-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>, showing that this extracellular mechanical event is necessary for transduction of the information embedded in the force waveform into intracellular biochemical signals via the 14-3-3\u03b6 connection (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). By overlapping with the ligand-binding site, the LRRD can feel the structural variation in the A1 and respond with an altered unfolding frequency and changed bond lifetime. Importantly, LRRD unfolding prolongs A1\u2013GPIb\u03b1 bond lifetime to facilitate MSD unfolding, thereby increasing the frequency of \u03b1-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> and its level (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, our study has elucidated part of a mechanosensor that includes three components: 1) a MSD in the juxtamembrane region whose conformational change results in a binary decision of Ca<sup>2+</sup> type, 2) a LRRD in the ligand-binding region whose conformational change leads to continuous alterations in ligand-binding duration, signal level and fractions of different signal types, and 3) a MP stalk that transmits force over a distance and provides coupling between the two unfoldable domains. The differential unfolding behaviors of the LRRD and MSD in response to distinct force waveforms provide a simple mechanical mechanism for unfolding cooperativity, by setting the response order such that LRRD unfolds first during force ramp to give more time for MSD to unfold during force clamp. These principles may be helpful for design of a generic mechanosensor, e.g., using synthetic biology approaches."

This has been suggested by the observation that the values of the first two peaks (20 and 36\u00a0nm) do not add up to that of the third (65-70\u00a0nm) in the unfolding length histograms. We note that the observed maximum unfolding length from the GC experiments (56\u00a0nm) is smaller than the calculated contour length of LRRD (70\u00a0nm). Since\u00a0LRRD consists of 8 leucine-rich repeats, this suggests that only some but not all of the repeats were unfolded in any given observation. Thus, the LRRD dataset contains mixed populations of partial unfolding events. By comparison, the MSD dataset may be a more uniform population as the observed maximum unfolding length from the WM23 experiments (27\u00a0nm) matches the calculated contour length of MSD (26\u00a0nm). These considerations suggest possible explanations for the observation that events in which both LRRD and MSD unfold generate more length than the sum of lengths generated from events in which either LRRD or MSD unfolds: LRRD unfolding events with a higher number of unfolded leucine-rich repeats may facilitate MSD unfolding more effectively than those with a lower number of unfolded leucine-rich repeats. Alternatively, MSD unfolding, once happens, may induce more leucine-rich repeats in LRRD to unfold. Note that these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive."

Mechanosensitive enzymes or substrates, such as vinculin (<a href=\"#bib12\">del Rio et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Grashoff et al., 2010</a>) or A2 domain of VWF (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang et al., 2009b</a>), change conformations in response to forces to expose a cryptic site to enable enzymatic reaction. By comparison, for the system studied herein, force signals are received by the receptor via ligand interaction, hence mediated by their binding kinetics. The process of transducing the extracellular mechanical events (i.e., LRRD and/or MSD unfolding) across the cell membrane is likely mechanical rather than chemical (i.e., ion influx)."

Other than the requirement for VWF\u2013GPIb\u03b1 binding, the underlying mechanism of such purely force-induced platelet thrombosis remains elusive.

Using a 9.53\u00a0nm bin width determined by the Freedman-Diaconis formula and Freedman and Diaconis\u2019 heuristic rule (<a href=\"#bib15\">Freedman and Diaconis, 1981</a>) for histogram analysis also revealed three peaks, although the valley separating the first two peaks consists of a single low fraction bin only (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The first two peaks in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> were suggested as MSD and LRRD unfolding, respectively, based on their favorable comparisons to the respective WM23 vs. platelet and A1WT vs. GC data in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, which allowed only MSD or LRRD to\u00a0unfoldrespectively. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the molecular mechanics by sorting the unfolding forces and lengths into subgroups from the respective WM23 vs. platelet and A1WT vs. GC experiments, plotted the average unfolding force vs. length data, and fitted the data to the WLC model (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zhang et al., 2009a</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2015</a>). The best-fit curves were then served as standards to calibrate the average unfolding force vs. length data from the A1WT vs. platelet experiment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>). The agreement between the data and the calibrated WLC curves rigorously verified the hypothetical identities of the first two peaks in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>."

There are 4 possible outcomes (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>): a false positive (FP) happens when <i>t</i><sub>max</sub>&gt;<i>t</i><sub>0</sub> and a \u03b2-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> was observed; a false negative (FN) happens when <i>t</i><sub>max</sub>\u2264<i>t</i><sub>0</sub> and an \u03b1-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> was observed; a true positive (TP) happens when and an \u03b1-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> was observed, and a true negative (TN) happens when <i>t</i><sub>max</sub>\u2264<i>t</i><sub>0</sub> and a \u03b2-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> was observed. The sensitivity or true positive rate defines the fraction of true positive among all positive results, TP/(TP+FN), whereas the specificity or true negative rate defines the fraction of true negative among all negative results, TN/(TN+FP). The optimal threshold is solved by minimizing the total counts of false positive and false negative. To do that, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was created by plotting the TP rate (sensitivity) against the FP rate (1- specificity) at various <i>t</i><sub>max</sub> values from which the optimal threshold <i>t</i><sub>0</sub> that achieved the best sensitivity and specificity was identified (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

As a result, the fitting parameters derived from individual pulling cycle may sometimes be variable. Therefore, we analyzed the ensemble data with the WLC model and fitted it to the averaged unfolding force vs. length data (Zhang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2009). MSD and LRRD have different contour lengths, and on platelet GPIb\u03b1 they could unfold sequentially or concurrently. Before treating convoluted data from possible unfolding of either or both domains, we first analyzed data acquired from WM23 vs. platelet experiments, which contain only putative MSD unfolding events (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>) and A1 vs. Glycocalicin (GC) experiments, which contain only putative LRRD unfolding events (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). From all ramped unfolding events, we sorted the unfolding lengths into 2-4 nm bins, plotted the averaged unfolding force vs. length curves, and fitted the WLC model to the data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H and I</a>). It is evident that the WLC model fits both data sets well, yielding respective contour lengths of 25.99 \u00b1 0.85 nm and 70.29 \u00b1 3.56. Assuming a contour length of 4 \u00c5 per residue (Zhang et al., 2015), these values indicate that structural domains of 65 and 175 residues were respectively unfolded in the WM23 vs. platelet GPIb\u03b1 and A1 vs. GC experiments, which well match the respective maximum lengths of unfolded MSD (Zhang et al., 2015) and LRRD (Ju et al., 2015) as previously discussed."

In BFP experiments on the GC construct, we used antibody mapping to locate where unfolding happened. Both AN51 and HIP1 could induce GC unfolding events whereas SZ2 could not (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>). This indicates that any pulling through a position lower than LRRD could not induce unfolding, confirming that unfolding occurred within the LRRD region. Interestingly, although the estimated contour length of LRRD is 70 nm, we rarely observed unfolding length beyond 56 nm with the GC construct, suggesting that not all leucine-rich repeats of the LRRD would be unfolded in every pulling of our BFP experiment."

It is well-known that kernel density estimates are the best nonparametric estimator of the probability density of the underlying population (Wahba, 1975), and they provide a better approximation than histograms given the limited sample size (Scott, 1979). With this rationale, we first used the nonparametric kernel density estimation method to choose the bin width and detect peaks in the data distribution, without imposing any parametric assumptions (Freedman and Diaconis, 1981). Specifically, we used the well-established reliable data-based bandwidth selection method (Sheather and Jones, 1991) to determine the optimal bin width to be 5.12 nm. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, using Gaussian kernels and Epanechnikov kernels both result in kernel density estimates that resemble the <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> histogram and identify three peaks in the ramped unfolding length distribution. This analysis has validated our choice of 5 nm as the bin width and confirm the presence of three peaks in the histograms. The discussion has been incorporated in the Method."

These appear to be force ramp measurements where the probe and the platelet are separated continuously and not a force clamp measurement. Why then should this data depend on the set point unless the different loading rates (separation velocity) were used for different set points? However the authors claim that the experiments were performed at the same loading rate. Furthermore, we are unable to reconcile the data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> showing that no LRRD unfolding is observed when the force set-point is at 10 pN and the data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> showing LRRD unfolding events when the set-point is 10 pN. The authors need to clear this up.</i>"

The experiments were performed in force-clamp assays (See Method) but the unfolding events in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a> occurred during the ramping phase before the force arrived at the clamped level. After checking, we found that the original <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> was mistakenly labeled. The LRRD unfolding events should have been collected with experiments pulling GPIb\u03b1 on platelets rather than its purified extracellular portion (GC). Here we corrected the label in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and replaced the <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> with the platelet GPIb\u03b1 data. We did not observe any LRRD unfolding on live platelets at 10 pN clamped force, but did observe (although extremely infrequent, ~2%) LRRD unfolding using purified GC in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>."
