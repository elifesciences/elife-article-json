Using electron microscopy, we have determined the structure of the CMG in the presence of ATP\u03b3S and a DNA duplex bearing a 3\u2032 single-stranded tail. The structure shows that the MCM subunits of the CMG bind preferentially to single-stranded DNA, establishes the polarity by which DNA enters into the Mcm2-7 pore, and explains how Cdc45 helps prevent DNA from dissociating from the helicase. The Mcm2-7 subcomplex forms a cracked-ring, right-handed spiral when DNA and nucleotide are bound, revealing unexpected congruencies between the CMG and both bacterial DnaB helicases and the AAA+ motor of the eukaryotic proteasome. The existence of a subpopulation of dimeric CMGs establishes the subunit register of Mcm2-7 double hexamers and together with the spiral form highlights how Mcm2-7 transitions through different conformational and assembly states as it matures into a functional helicase."

Using electron microscopy, we have determined the structure of the CMG in the presence of ATP\u03b3S and a DNA duplex bearing a 3\u2032 single-stranded tail. The structure shows that the MCM subunits of the CMG bind preferentially to single-stranded DNA, establishes the polarity by which DNA enters into the Mcm2-7 pore, and explains how Cdc45 helps prevent DNA from dissociating from the helicase. The Mcm2-7 subcomplex forms a cracked-ring, right-handed spiral when DNA and nucleotide are bound, revealing unexpected congruencies between the CMG and both bacterial DnaB helicases and the AAA+ motor of the eukaryotic proteasome. The existence of a subpopulation of dimeric CMGs establishes the subunit register of Mcm2-7 double hexamers and together with the spiral form highlights how Mcm2-7 transitions through different conformational and assembly states as it matures into a functional helicase."

Mcm2-7 is initially loaded around duplex DNA as an inactive double hexamer by the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib14\">Evrin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Remus et al., 2009</a>), forming a stable intermediate known as the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC, <a href=\"#bib10\">Diffley et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Donovan et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Maiorano et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yanagi et al., 2002</a>).

How the various components of the CMG engage nucleic acid strands during this process has remained ill-defined.

The structure establishes that: 1) the CMG preferentially associates with single-stranded DNAs over double-stranded substrates, 2) the C-terminal ATPase domains of Mcm2-7 form the leading edge of the motor as it advances on a duplex, and 3) the RecJ domain of Cdc45 is oriented to favor the capture of DNA segments that might accidently escape the Mcm2-7 pore. Comparison of the new structure with a previously-determined apo CMG model (<a href=\"#bib8\">Costa et al., 2011</a>) shows that the Mcm2-7 ATPase domains of the complex transition from a planar, open ring into a closed, right-handed spiral in the presence of both DNA and nucleotide. Analysis of this state alongside other ring-ATPases shows that the MCM spiral is most similar to that adopted by the bacterial DnaB helicase upon engaging single-stranded DNA (<a href=\"#bib24\">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</a>), and that the GINS\u2022Cdc45 complex bridges the junction between the ends of the spiral in a manner similar to that by which the Rpn1 accessory subunit spans a spiral Rpt1-6 ATPase assembly in the eukaryotic proteasome (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lander et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, examination of a subpopulation of CMG dimers present in our EM data shows how two Mcm2-7 complexes associate within a double hexamer and suggests that this dimerized state persists during CMG formation, prior to separation during fork progression (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ilves et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yardimci et al., 2010</a>). Collectively, our observations establish that Mcm2-7 unwinds DNA using an approach distinct from that of superfamily III helicases and highlight several new Mcm2-7 ring configurations and assembly states accessed by the motor during the initiation of DNA replication."

Though sufficient for mapping individual subunits within the CMG, both models revealed a planar structure for Mcm2-7, with GINS and Cdc45 spanning a gap that appeared between Mcm2 and Mcm5 when nucleotide was omitted. Since insights into where DNA might bind to the CMG or how binding might potentially alter the structure of complex were unclear, we set out to trap and image a prospective translocation intermediate of the CMG using 3D single-particle electron microscopy. A purified solution of the CMG was first mixed with a 20 bp duplex DNA substrate bearing a single-stranded 3\u2032-dT<sub>(40)</sub> tail and passed over a sizing column in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, ATP\u03b3S, to form a ternary complex. The complex did not behave well during cryo-preservation attempts using holey-carbon EM grids, so samples were instead deposited onto continuous carbon grids and exposed to uranyl formate for negative staining. A total of 29,913 particles were selected from EM micrographs acquired with JADAS automated data collection software (JEOL, <a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>) on a JEM2100 electron microscope. Following particle picking and 2D averaging, a 3D model was generated by projection matching using a low-pass filtered (60 \u00c5), free-hand test-validated, nucleotide-bound structure of the CMG as a starting model (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lyubimov et al., 2012</a>)."

The resultant model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) in turn allowed for a more accurate fitting of the Mcm2-7 and GINS subunits (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), revealing several new features. For instance, the location of Psf1 C-terminus, which was previously not visible, was now clearly evident, and could be readily fit to a recently-published full-length structure of Psf1 from an archaeal ortholog (<a href=\"#bib42\">Oyama et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Flexing within the Mcm2-7 ring was also apparent with the C-terminal lobes of different MCM subunits displaying markedly distinct degrees of movement with respect to their associated N-terminal regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Asymmetric positioning between the two tiers of an MCM ring has not been reported previously, demonstrating that these elements are conformationally independent of each other to some extent in the presence of DNA substrates."

Inspection of the resultant 2D class averages from this approach revealed clear additional density compared to the unlabeled CMG\u2013DNA particles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), demonstrating that the tailed substrate indeed associates with the complex particles.

MCMs and viral SF3 helicases, such as SV40 LTag and the papilloma virus E1 protein, are both AAA+ ATPases (<a href=\"#bib40\">Neuwald et al., 1999</a>). This relationship, coupled with shared ability of MCMs and SF3 enzymes to translocate along DNA in a 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 direction (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kelman et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chong et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bochman and Schwacha, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Moyer et al., 2006</a>), has suggested that members of two helicase families might operate by a common translocation mechanism. However, studies of E1 and archaeal MCMs bound to DNA substrates have yielded conflicting data concerning the direction by which DNA threads through the helicase pore. In E1, the 3\u2032 end of DNA has been observed by X-ray crystallography to lie proximal to the C-terminal motor domains of the helicase (<a href=\"#bib12\">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</a>). By contrast, based on FRET measurements between a dye-labeled DNA/MCM pair, the converse has been reported for <i>Sulfolobus solfataricus</i> MCM (<a href=\"#bib36\">McGeoch et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rothenberg et al., 2007</a>). In the new CMG structure, the streptavidin appended to the duplex DNA end can be clearly seen to localize next to the C-terminal, AAA+ domain face of the particle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This finding not only demonstrates that a DNA segment bound by an MCM runs from the N-terminal collar to the ATPase motor region in a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction, but also indicates that MCM and SF3 helicases bind substrates with opposing polarities."

To test whether this interaction might be real or fortuitous, we subjected the Psf1 B-domain surface to site-directed mutagenesis and tested the ability of the mutant subunits to support binding to both Mcm2-7 and Cdc45 (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Ablation of either the Psf1 B-domain region (residues 185\u2013202) or Cdc45 N-terminal region (residues 1\u201399) prevented CMG formation under the conditions used to purify the intact assembly (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Likewise, while point mutations were unable to disrupt CMG formation as judged by co-immunoprecipitation, a quadruple Psf1 mutant (E190A/L192A/V193A/R194A) proved unable to interact with Cdc45. Together, these data indicate that the Cdc45\u2013Psf1 interaction evident from the EM data plays a critical role in CMG formation and/or stability."

This transition in turn pinched off the large single channel that ran through the particle into two smaller channels, sealing the interior of Mcm2-7 away from the inner surface of GINS\u2013Cdc45. In the DNA-bound model, the CMG still exhibits two channels; however, docking of the Cdc45 RecJ domain shows that its exonuclease/DNA-tracking groove is offset by 90\u00b0 with respect to the central axis of the Mcm2-7 pore (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This orientation indicates that, were Cdc45 to bind DNA in a manner similar to RecJ, it would be poised to capture the leading DNA strand that might escape from Mcm5-2 gate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Consistent with this idea, cross-linking data in work to be published elsewhere (Petojevic et al.) show both that Cdc45 engages the leading strand of a fork substrate only in the absence of nucleotide and that this interaction is ablated by the mutation of residues suggested by the model to be important for DNA binding."

                                "text": "Closer analysis of the AAA+ spiral reveals several features that have important implications for the action of MCM subunits during DNA unwinding. First, the largest inter-subunit shifts within the Mcm2-7 ring, which occur between Mcm subunits 2 and 5, also correspond to the point where the GINS\u2013Cdc45 complex docks against the helicase. Inspection of the DNA-bound model reveals that GINS\u2013Cdc45 does not simply straddle the Mcm2/5 interface, but that portions of the accessory subunits actually wedge themselves between the N- and C-terminal tiers of the Mcm2-7 ring (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This action widens the exterior groove between the MCM N- and C-terminal domains at their points-of-contact with GINS\u2013Cdc45, and is offset by a concomitant narrowing of the groove on the exterior MCM face opposite the GINS\u2013Cdc45 binding site (i.e., Mcm4, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The structural consequences resulting from GINS\u2013Cdc45 binding suggests that these accessory subunits not only play a role in blocking access through the Mcm2/5 gate, as has been seen previously (<a href=\"#bib8\">Costa et al., 2011</a>), but that they also help stabilize a spiral configuration of ATPase centers when DNA is present. Since the mutation of active site residues at the Mcm2/5 interface ablates helicase activity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bochman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ilves et al., 2010</a>), it is likely that the spiral state observed here, which positionally offsets the ATP-binding site of Mcm5 from the arginine-finger residue of Mcm2, inter-converts with another conformation in which the Mcm2/5 interface is remodeled to form a catalytically functional ATPase center during the translocation cycle. Hence, a need for GINS\u2013Cdc45 in preventing DNA from escaping Mcm2-7 would likely be infrequent and limited to instances when the Mcm2/5 gate accidentally opens for an extended period of time, such as at a roadblock created by other nucleoprotein complexes or DNA damage."

                                "text": "A second unexpected feature of the DNA-bound CMG complex is that the spiral is more pronounced than that seen in SF3 helicases, and instead more closely approximating the spiral evinced by a RecA-family helicase, DnaB, in the presence of DNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>). The width of the Mcm2-7 central channel (as measured from homology models of the motor domains docked into the EM density) is likewise significantly larger (\u223c30\u201335 \u00c5) compared to E1 (\u223c14 \u00c5), and more closely approaches that of DnaB (\u223c22 \u00c5). Interestingly, in E1 and DnaB the difference in channel diameter and subunit rise between the two proteins sculpts the DNA substrate bound by each helicase into a single-stranded helix whose relative pitches differ significantly; these geometric differences allow each subunit of DnaB to engage two nucleotides of DNA (<a href=\"#bib24\">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</a>), whereas E1 binds only a single nucleotide per protomer (<a href=\"#bib12\">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</a>). The similarity of the Mcm2-7 spiral to DnaB raises the interesting possibility that the helicase might translocate with a step-size greater than one nucleotide per ATP consumed; consistent with this notion, a recent study has shown that the MCM N-terminal DNA-binding collar of <i>Pyrococcus furiosus</i> binds four nucleotides per subunit (<a href=\"#bib17\">Froelich et al., 2014</a>)."

The proteasome consists of several discrete subcomplexes including a heterohexameric unfoldase region, termed the \u2018base\u2019, which (like the CMG) contains six homologous AAA+ ATPase subunits (Rpt1-6) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Forster et al., 2013</a>). Recent cryo-EM studies have imaged the complete 26S yeast proteasome bound to ATP at \u223c9 \u00c5 resolution showing that the AAA+ subunits of the base also form a right-handed spiral (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lander et al., 2012</a>). Comparison of proteasome spiral with that seen here for the CMG shows that these regions of the two systems exhibit a surprisingly similar global architecture (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Moreover, the proteasome also contains an accessory subunit (Rpn1) that\u2014as observed here for GINS\u2013Cdc45 in the context of the CMG\u2014wedges itself between a subset of ATPase and OB-fold domains present in Rpt1-6 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lander et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). The structural congruencies exhibited between the CMG and proteasome ATPase subcomplexes suggest that, even though the substrates for the two systems differ greatly, both motors may share certain commonalities in how ATP turnover is coupled to movements that promote translocation. Such a similarity could underlie both the pronounced asymmetry of the CMG and proteasome ATPase rings, and the relatively high degree of tolerance shown by both systems toward active-site mutations within certain subunits (<a href=\"#bib37\">Moreau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ilves et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Beckwith et al., 2013</a>)."

In particular, a small (\u223c5%) but consistent population of CMG particles was seen to form a clear dimeric species that adopts a distinctive head-to-head configuration through its MCM N-terminal regions, and which consistently orients the GINS\u2013Cdc45 subcomplex toward opposing sides of the two ring (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

For example, the 180\u00b0 offset of GINS and Cdc45 present in the dimer places each Mcm2/5 gate on the opposite sides of the complex, facing away from each other (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). During origin melting, this configuration would allow a single DNA strand to escape each Mcm2-7 hexamer without steric interference from its partner CMG, enabling particle separation and the formation of two independent replication forks. The organization of the CMG dimer also indicates that the N-terminal regions of Mcm2 and Mcm5 of one hexamer associate in <i>trans</i> with the N-terminal regions of Mcm6 and Mcm4 of the partner hexamer. Such an interaction would help explain why Mcm4 and GINS have been seen to interact in pulldown studies (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ilves et al., 2010</a>), even though the two factors map to distal positions of the CMG in the context of a monomer (<a href=\"#bib8\">Costa et al., 2011</a>). Finally, the observed arrangement suggests that the ability of DDK to activate Mcm2-7 by phosphorylation of Mcm4, 2, and 6 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Labib, 2010</a>) (as well as the ability of the Bob1 mutation in Mcm5 to bypass the requirement for DDK [<a href=\"#bib25\">Jackson et al., 1993</a>]) could result from a destabilization of the CMG dimer contacts that are symmetrically apposed across the N-terminal collar (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Altogether, our data establish that the two Mcm2/5 gates of a double hexamer are spatially segregated from each other and indicate that separation of Mcm2-7 double hexamers occurs subsequent to CMG formation. Such a mechanism is consistent with recent findings showing that the phosphorylation by DDK is insufficient to promote the separation of Mcm2-7 double hexamers on its own (<a href=\"#bib41\">On et al., 2014</a>)."

Biochemical studies using <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> proteins first showed that Mcm2-7 on its own possesses a natural discontinuity\u2014the \u2018Mcm2/5 gate\u2019\u2014through which DNA can enter and exit the helicase pore (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bochman and Schwacha, 2007</a>). Structural studies have corroborated this observation, additionally showing that metazoan Mcm2-7 rings preferentially assume a left-handed lock-washer shape and that ATP alone is incapable of fully inducing ring closure (<a href=\"#bib8\">Costa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lyubimov et al., 2012</a>). Following the action of ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1, two Mcm2-7 hexamers become locked into a planarized co-joined ring (<a href=\"#bib14\">Evrin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Remus et al., 2009</a>); in the presence of GINS, Cdc45, and single-stranded DNA, the Mcm2-7 ATPase domains shift again, but now into a right-handed spiral conformation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Thus, Mcm2-7 undergoes a chiral-flip in architectural state as it matures into a functional helicase with loading, activation, and DNA binding all appearing to participate in these transitions."

One possibility is that Mcm2-7 initially assembles into an inactive conformation to prevent inadvertently triggering aberrant replication events. An alternative possibility, not necessarily incompatible with the first, is that Mcm2-7 might transition through different forms as a means to promote the melting of duplex replication origins. Interestingly, an important attribute of some of the states adopted by Mcm2-7 is the existence of a breach or subunit offset in the ATPase ring between the Mcm2 and Mcm5 subunits. Given the topological barrier that extended DNA segments present to encirclement by toroidal proteins, it is notable that two MCM-associated factors\u2014Cdt1 and GINS\u2013Cdc45\u2014both appear to occlude the Mcm2/5 interface (<a href=\"#bib8\">Costa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). Hence, controlled access through the Mcm2/5 gate appears useful not only for regulating DNA access into a preformed Mcm2-7 hexamer (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bochman and Schwacha, 2007</a>), but also for preventing accidental DNA egress in the apo state and at stalled forks (Petojevic et al., unpublished data)."

The structure reveals that the RecJ domain of Cdc45, which recent data have found to bind to escaped leading strand substrates (Petojevic et al., unpublished data), takes up a position on the CMG that would aid in capturing a DNA segment that might escape from the Mcm2-7 pore. Our EM data show that the nucleotide-loaded CMG orients on single-stranded DNA such that the 3\u2032 end enters first through the C-terminal AAA+ domains of Mcm2-7, consistent with prior biochemical data indicating that archaeal MCMs move along DNA with the opposite polarity as superfamily III helicases (<a href=\"#bib35\">McGeoch and Bell, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rothenberg et al., 2007</a>). The binding of DNA to the CMG also induces the formation of a right-handed spiral in the MCM ATPase domains whose overall structure more closely mimics bacterial RecA-family replicative helicases than its viral AAA+ cousins, and whose relative arrangement of AAA+ domains and accessory subunits is mirrored by the regulatory subcomplex of the eukaryotic proteasome (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lander et al., 2012</a>). Finally, we find that the CMG can form head-to-head dimers in which the two Mcm2/5 gates are fully offset from each other, helping to fill in key gaps concerning the higher-order organization of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer and how the CMG matures from this state into two single particles that encircle complementary single strands. Future studies will be needed to definitively establish the full paths of the leading- and lagging-strand DNA bound to the CMG and the extent to which the disparate AAA+ and RecA-family ring-translocases share or diverge in coupling ATP turnover to specific subunit movements that drive substrate translocation."

                                "text": "Particles were semi-automatically picked and phase flipped using the EMAN2 package, version 2.05 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tang et al., 2007</a>). Reference free two-dimensional class-sums were obtained using RELION, version 1.2 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Scheres, 2012</a>), except for the streptavidin-DNA-bound CMG complex that was processed using Imagic (<a href=\"#bib57\">van Heel et al., 1996</a>) and the rotation and classification protocol implemented in <a href=\"#bib8\">Costa et al. (2011)</a>. Working with the ADP(BeF3) bound CMG as a starting model (<a href=\"#bib8\">Costa et al., 2011</a>), multi-model three-dimensional refinement was performed with an iterative projection-matching and back-projection protocol that employs libraries from the EMAN2 and SPARX software packages (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hohn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tang et al., 2007</a>) or, in a parallel effort, using three-dimensional classification and refinement routines as implemented in RELION (<a href=\"#bib50\">Scheres, 2012</a>). Refinement of the starting models began using an angular increment of 15\u00b0, progressing down to 2\u00b0 with EMAN2/SPARX, and default parameters in RELION 1.2 (7.5\u00b0 angular sampling, 5 pixel search range, and 1 pixel search step). The two approaches yielded virtually identical results (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) with the best structure containing 7,409 particles (obtained with EMAN2/SPARX and shown in all figures). The resolution was estimated by the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 Fourier Shell Correlation approach implemented in RELION (<a href=\"#bib50\">Scheres, 2012</a>). 3D-maps were segmented using the Segger program (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pintilie and Chiu, 2012</a>) in UCSF Chimera (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). The Chimera \u2018Fit in Map\u2019 option was used for rigid-body fitting of crystal structures and to generate all surface renderings included in the figures (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). The full-length Psf1 protein was modelled by superposing the <i>Thermococcus kodakaraensis</i> GINS51 (PDB entry 3ANW) onto the human Psf1 structure. The N-terminal Mcm2-7 collar was modelled by superposing protomers of the <i>Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus</i> MCM (PDB entry 1LTL) or the <i>Sulfolobus solfataricus</i> MCM (PDB entry 2VL6) onto the isolated oligomerization subdomain of the <i>M. thermautotrophicus</i> MCM. The two structures exhibit markedly distinct configurations in their N-terminal \u03b1-helical region (subdomain A), with the <i>S. solfataricus</i> MCM region matching best to the N-terminal domain configuration of Mcm4 and Mcm5. The atomic model of the near full-length <i>S. solfataricus</i> MCM (PDB entry 3F9V) was found to fit the entire Mcm4 electron density region, whereas slight rigid body transformations of the MCM AAA+ domain relative to the N-terminal region were allowed to best fit the electron density of Mcms 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. A homology model based on the bacterial RecJ (PDB entry 1IR6) was used for docking of Cdc45. The EM map has been deposited in the 3D-EM database (<a href=\"www.emdatabank.org\">www.emdatabank.org</a>) with accession code EMD-2772."

As ssDNA is poorly visualized under EM, the streptavidin marks the location of the DNA in the complex. However, 1) the class averages in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> show the streptavidin at a considerable distance from the CMG complex, making assignment of a specific DNA-binding MCM subunit difficult, and 2) as nearly as this reviewer can tell, there is nothing in the text that specifically identifies Mcm5 as the sole DNA binding subunit.

A major point in the paper is the physical interaction between CDC45 and Mcm5, in which the N terminus of CDC45 is proposed to essentially pry apart the N and C-terminal domains of Mcm5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). There are several technical problems with this conclusion. Although varying the thresholding (presumably through Chimera) is a useful way to emphasize various features, in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> it is so extensive that the N and C-terminal domains of Mcm5 are completely separated from one another, a feature not demonstrated by other CMG structures presented in this paper. In general, the thresholding level should generate an enclosed volume consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the component proteins: was this done? When 2 structures are being compared, the levels of thresholding and filtering should be the same in each structure."

This question has an additional problem insofar as the region of CDC45 that likely interacts with Mcm5 is not highly conserved and the authors were unable to generate a homology model for it. Moreover, the software used for segmentation that sets the subunit boundaries (likely the Segger tool in Chimera) requires a very high-resolution structure to give reliable results without computational validation (&lt; 10 angstroms). Although for transmission EM the structures in this manuscript are excellent, it seems a little optimistic that the authors have enough resolution to accurately validate these boundaries visually. There are computational methods available to provide proper validation of their results (<a href=\"http://ncmi.bcm.edu/ncmi/software/segger/docs_fitting_scores\">http://ncmi.bcm.edu/ncmi/software/segger/docs_fitting_scores</a>)."

This question has an additional problem insofar as the region of CDC45 that likely interacts with Mcm5 is not highly conserved and the authors were unable to generate a homology model for it.

This comparison shows that no density is appended to either the N-terminal helical domain of Mcm5 or Mcm2 in the isolated Mcm2-7 complex.
