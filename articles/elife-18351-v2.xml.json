Here, we demonstrate that BRAF serves a crucial function in formation of limb skeletal muscles during mouse embryogenesis downstream of MET and acts as a potent inducer of myoblast cell migration. We found that a fraction of BRAF accumulates in the nucleus after activation and endosomal transport to a perinuclear position. Mass spectrometry based screening for potential interaction partners revealed that BRAF interacts and phosphorylates PAX3. Mutation of BRAF dependent phosphorylation sites in PAX3 impaired the ability of PAX3 to promote migration of C2C12 myoblasts indicating that BRAF directly activates PAX3. Since PAX3 stimulates transcription of the <i>Met</i> gene we propose that MET signaling via BRAF fuels a positive feedback loop, which maintains high levels of PAX3 and MET activity required for limb muscle precursor cell migration."

Here, we demonstrate that BRAF serves a crucial function in formation of limb skeletal muscles during mouse embryogenesis downstream of MET and acts as a potent inducer of myoblast cell migration. We found that a fraction of BRAF accumulates in the nucleus after activation and endosomal transport to a perinuclear position. Mass spectrometry based screening for potential interaction partners revealed that BRAF interacts and phosphorylates PAX3. Mutation of BRAF dependent phosphorylation sites in PAX3 impaired the ability of PAX3 to promote migration of C2C12 myoblasts indicating that BRAF directly activates PAX3. Since PAX3 stimulates transcription of the <i>Met</i> gene we propose that MET signaling via BRAF fuels a positive feedback loop, which maintains high levels of PAX3 and MET activity required for limb muscle precursor cell migration."

Importantly, mutants of MET unable to bind the adaptor GRB2, which is considered to act as the primary mediator of RAS-RAF activation, does not affect migration of limb muscle precursor cells but inhibits proliferation of fetal myoblasts and formation of secondary myofibers (<a href=\"#bib34\">Maina et al., 1996</a>). In contrast, inactivation of the adaptor <i>Gab1</i> severely impairs migration of limb muscle precursor cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sachs et al., 2000</a>). GAB1 acts as a docking platform for several molecules including PI3K, PLC, CRK, and SHP2 but also activates the RAS-RAF route after activation by the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Birchmeier et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Trusolino et al., 2010</a>). This raises several questions: Does the RAS-RAF pathway contribute to migration of limb muscle precursor cells? If RAF is involved in regulation of limb muscle precursor cell migration, which of the three serine/threonine kinases (ARAF, BRAF, CRAF) does the job? Are potential effects of RAF transmitted via the canonical MEK-ERK pathway or by different means?"

We found that <i>Braf</i> is required for muscle precursor cell migration and skeletal muscle formation in the forelimbs. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed that BRAF phosphorylates and activates PAX3 after endosomal trafficking to a perinuclear position and translocation into the nucleus. Our results suggest a positive feedback loop, which drives skeletal muscle formation by maintaining high levels of PAX3 and MET activity in migrating limb muscle precursor cells."

To identify the branches of the MET signaling network driving migration of myogenic cells, we turned to the muscle cell line C2C12, since evaluation of signaling processes in migrating limb muscle precursor cells is difficult due to the small size of the cell population and its transient appearance. We found that HGF, the ligand of the MET receptor, robustly induced migration of C2C12 cells. Stimulation of migration was blocked by knockdown of <i>Met</i> demonstrating that C2C12 cells can be utilized to study the mechanisms of MET receptor signaling for migration of myogenic cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Systematic analysis of the role of potential downstream effectors of MET signaling by siRNA-mediated knockdown disclosed an important role of the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase BRAF, which essentially phenocopied the effects of <i>Met</i> receptor knockdown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Interestingly, knockdown of <i>Pax3</i> did also inhibit HGF-mediated stimulation of C2C12 cell migration suggesting a functional involvement of PAX3 in MET signaling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To test whether expression of BRAF alone is sufficient to promote migration we transfected WT Braf and the constitutively active (CA) Braf (V600E) mutation into C2C12 cells. We observed a strong stimulation of migration by CA BRAF (V600E) and -to a lesser extent- WT BRAF while expression of CRAF had only minor effects on muscle cell migration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). CA BRAF (V600E) and WT BRAF also stimulated expression of <i>Pax3</i> and <i>Met</i> in C2C12 cells adding further evidence to the putative role of BRAF in the regulatory loop controlling migration of myogenic cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Next, we investigated whether BRAF and PAX3 also promote migration of primary dermomyotomal cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mennerich et al., 1998</a>). We found that RCAS virus-mediated expression of BRAF and PAX3 but not human alkaline phosphatase (AP) increased cellular migration out of somitic explants isolated from chicken embryos and cultivated in matrigel further corroborating the results obtained with C2C12 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

                                "text": "Although C2C12 cells represent a useful model to study mechanistic aspects of muscle cell migration, the inhibition of HGF-stimulated migration after knockdown of <i>Braf</i> does not prove that <i>Braf</i> is also instrumental to regulate limb muscle formation in the embryo in vivo. We therefore took advantage of a mouse strain (Braf<sup>nfl</sup>) in which three <i>loxP</i>-sites had been inserted to flank exon three as well as a neomycin selection cassette (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pfeiffer et al., 2013</a>). Breeding with MeuCre mice (<a href=\"#bib33\">Leneuve et al., 2003</a>) yielded Braf<sup>fl</sup> mice, in which the neomycin cassette was removed but exon three is flanked by <i>loxP</i>-sites, and Braf<sup>del</sup> mice lacking exon 3, which encodes parts of the Ras-binding domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Deletion of exon three created a functional null allele of <i>Braf</i> leading to embryonic lethality of Braf<sup>del/del</sup> mice consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pfeiffer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wojnowski et al., 1997</a>). Braf<sup>fl</sup> mice were crossed to the Pax3-Cre strain allowing specific inactivation of <i>Braf</i> in the dermomyotome and limb muscle precursor cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Immunofluorescence staining using an anti-BRAF antibody confirmed the absence of BRAF protein in the dermomyotome of Pax3-Cre//Braf<sup>del/del</sup> mutant embryos at E10.5 while the dermomyotome of WT control embryos was strongly positive for BRAF (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, germ line inactivation (Braf<sup>del/del</sup>) as well as deletion of <i>Braf</i> in <i>Pax3</i>-expressing limb muscle precursor cells (Pax3-Cre//Braf<sup>del/del</sup>) resulted in arrest of cell migration as indicated by the absence of PAX3<sup>+</sup>-cells in the developing forelimb buds at E10.5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), which was further validated by immunofluorescence analysis of PAX3<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and RT-PCR analysis of <i>Met</i> and <i>Pax3</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Closer inspection of the PAX3 immunofluorescence staining revealed that only very few <i>Braf</i>-deficient PAX3<sup>+</sup>-cells delaminated from the dermomyotome and initiated migration suggesting a requirement of <i>Braf</i> for epithelia-mesenchymal transition of dermomyotomal cells and/or migration (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Staining for <i>Lbx1</i> expression, which is also expressed in limb muscle precursor cells and needed for targeted migration, confirmed this conclusion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We also found a virtually complete absence of <i>Myod</i> and <i>Myf5</i> expressing myogenic cells in limb buds of E10.5 Pax3-Cre//Braf<sup>del/del</sup> embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), although we noted a reduced expression at later stages by Western blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) indicating that a small population of <i>Braf</i>-deficient limb muscle progenitor cells was able to reach its target. Accordingly, we observed a major reduction of forelimb muscles at later stages of development (E14.5), which was more pronounced in the distal compared to the proximal parts of the limb, where some residual muscle formation was seen (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). In contrast, we did not observe a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in <i>Braf</i> mutant compared to WT control embryos at E10.5 suggesting that the loss of <i>Braf</i> in dermomyotomal cells does not lead to programmed cell death (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, we investigated the presence of endothelial precursor cells in Pax3-Cre//Braf<sup>del/del</sup> mutant embryos at E10.5, since transplantation of <i>Kdr</i>-mutant mouse presomitic mesoderm into chicken embryos had revealed a crucial role of endothelial cells for muscle progenitor cell migration (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yvernogeau et al., 2012</a>). KDR primarily signals via the PKC-MAPK and the PI3K pathway (<a href=\"#bib54\">Vieira et al., 2010</a>), although some evidence exists that KDR can also activate MAPK via CRAF and MEK in some cells types (<a href=\"#bib51\">Takahashi et al., 1999</a>), which raised the possibility that inactivation of <i>Braf</i> might indirectly disrupt muscle progenitor cell migration by preventing migration of endothelial precursor cells downstream of KDR. However, similar to the presence of normal numbers of endothelial progenitor cells in <i>Pax3</i> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yvernogeau et al., 2012</a>), we did not observe a reduction of CD31-positive endothelial cells in <i>Braf</i> mutant limb buds (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) indicating that KDR does not critically rely on BRAF for promoting endothelial precursor cell migration."

RT-PCR analysis revealed a strong up-regulation of <i>Met</i> and <i>Pax3</i> expression indicating that BRAF induced transcription of both genes, most likely by activation of key transcription factors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In addition, we analyzed whether BRAF might directly increase the transcriptional activity of PAX3. We therefore constructed a luciferase reporter construct containing two PAX3 consensus binding sites in front of a minimal promoter. Co-transfection of the Pax3 reporter plasmid together with Pax3 and Braf or CA Braf (V600E) into HEK293T cells revealed a strong increase of transcriptional activity, resulting in an up to 15-fold change when CA Braf (V600E) was used (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Taken together our data indicate that BRAF is essential for limb muscle formation presumably by mediating MET signaling via PAX3 to enable migration of limb muscle precursor cells."

Importantly, mass spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitated samples from WT limb buds of E10.5 mouse embryos using an antibody against endogenous BRAF identified -among several other proteins- the nuclear transcription factors PAX3 and PAX7 as potential interaction partners of BRAF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar observations were made when BRAF was precipitated from C2C12 cells transfected with the CA Braf (V600E). Reciprocal mass spectrometry experiments, in which we incubated protein extracts from WT limb buds of E10.5 mouse embryos with GST-PAX3 protein followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-PAX3 antibody and immunoprecipitation of PAX3 from extracts of C2C12 cells transfected with HA-tagged Pax3 yielded identical results and also uncovered interactions of PAX3 and BRAF with components of the endocytosis pathway such as ARF5, six and DNM2 along with several other proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Coupled immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis of samples from E10.5 limb buds using either BRAF antibodies for IP and PAX3 antibodies for Western blot or vice versa further confirmed the physical interaction between BRAF and 53 kDa PAX3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Next, we wanted to know whether activation of BRAF leads to more efficient binding to PAX3. Comparative GST pull-down assays of extracts from C2C12 cells transfected either with WT Braf or CA Braf (V600E) revealed a significantly stronger interaction of the constitutively active compared to the WT form of BRAF with GST-PAX3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Identical results were obtained when endogenous PAX3 was immunoprecipitated from C2C12 cells after transfection with WT Braf or CA Braf (V600E) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Finally, we performed cross-linking experiments with NHS-diazirine cross-linker (SD) in C2C12 cells transfected with CA Braf (V600E) followed by immunoprecipitation with BRAF or PAX3 antibodies. Western blot analysis using corresponding antibodies detected the 95 kDa BRAF and the 53 kDa PAX3 proteins as separate bands (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Moreover, either antibody detected an additional single band at ca. 150 kDa, which corresponds to the cross-linked BRAF-PAX3 heteromer. Cleavage of the spacer with DTT severed the cross-linked BRAF-PAX3 complex, further verifying identity of the band (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

Hence, we analyzed specifically whether a fraction of BRAF is transported into the nucleus. Subcellular fractionation of C2C12 cells disclosed the presence of a minor amount of endogenous BRAF in the nucleus although the major share of BRAF was present in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In contrast, PAX3 was exclusively found in the nuclear fraction, even after expression of large amounts of HA-tagged Pax3. The concentration of BRAF in the nuclear fraction increased when CA Braf (V600E) was transfected into cells irrespective of the presence or absence of HGF. Interestingly, the nuclear level of BRAF decreased when endosomal trafficking was blocked by administration of Dynasore (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We also conducted additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments using only the nuclear fraction of transfected C2C12 cells, which corroborated the interaction of nuclear BRAF with PAX3 in the absence of cytosolic BRAF (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The co-immunoprecipitation experiments also revealed enhanced interaction of CA BRAF (V600E) with PAX3, which might be due to increased transport of CA BRAF (V600E) into the nucleus. Finally, we performed immunofluorescence staining for PAX3 and BRAF using mouse embryonic tissues or C2C12 cells transfected with Braf, CA Braf (V600E) and Pax3. We observed a striking co-localization of PAX3 and BRAF in nuclei of limb muscle precursor cells and strong signals for P-BRAF in nuclei of transfected cells although localization of P-BRAF in the cytoplasm dominated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Knockdown of <i>Eea1</i> resulted in decreased levels of nuclear BRAF while siErk1/2 showed little effects (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

To characterize potential phosphorylation sites within the PAX3 protein, we isolated PAX3 by immunoprecipitation from C2C12 cells, HEK293T cells and from mouse embryonic limb buds at E10.5. Subsequent fractionation of FASP-digested PAX3 peptides by cation-exchange liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry analysis using a quadrupole-based Q Exactive instrument identified multiple new phosphorylation sites at serine and threonine residues as well as five phosphorylation sites (at Ser180, Ser187, Ser201, Ser205 and Ser209), which had already been reported before (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The majority of the phosphorylation events corresponded well to sites predicted by NetPhos 2.0 (<a href=\"http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos\">www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos</a>), PHOSIDA (<a href=\"http://www.phosida.de\">www.phosida.de</a>) and PhosphoVariant (<a href=\"http://phosphovariant.ngri.go.kr\">http://phosphovariant.ngri.go.kr</a>). To understand whether enhanced BRAF activity increases phosphorylation of PAX3, we quantified the increase of serine and threonine phosphorylation by quantitative mass spectrometry after expression of CA Braf (V600E). HEK293T cells were SILAC labeled (Light: Arg0, Lys0; Heavy: Arg10, Lys8) for five passages and then transfected with Pax3 (light condition) or Pax3 plus CA Braf (V600E) (heavy condition). Protein extracts were prepared from each condition, combined at equal concentrations, processed and used for Titan (TiO<sub>2</sub>) bead-based extraction of phosphorylated peptides. This approach allowed us to calculate the relative abundance of phosphorylated sites in PAX3 in response to CA BRAF (V600E) due to differential labeling with separate stable isotopes. We found that transfection of Braf primarily increased PAX3 phosphorylation at Ser222 while phosphorylation at the other sites was not prominently enhanced when normalized to PAX3 protein concentrations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>)."

To analyze whether any of these phosphorylation sites are instrumental for the ability of PAX3 to stimulate muscle cell migration, we replaced the respective serine residues by alanine. As expected neither WT Pax3 nor the S201A, S205A, S209A and S222A mutant constructs increased the rate of migration without activation by BRAF (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) but co-transfection with CA Braf (V600E) revealed important differences. The S205A Pax3 mutant failed to stimulate muscle cell migration while S201A, S209A and S222A mutants had no discernable effects compared to WT Pax3 indicating that phosphorylation of Ser205 is instrumental for PAX3-dependent stimulation of muscle cell migration (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Since only mutation of Ser205 reduced the ability of BRAF to induce PAX3-dependent muscle cell migration, we wondered whether we had failed to detect BRAF-dependent up-regulation of PAX3 phosphorylation at this site in our quantitative mass spectrometry experiments. Therefore, we transfected Pax3 together with CA Braf (V600E) into HEK293T and C2C12 muscle cells, but this time monitored phosphorylation of PAX3 using an antibody specific for p-Ser205. We found that BRAF clearly induced phosphorylation of PAX3 at Ser205 in both cell types (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Furthermore, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant BRAF and bacterially produced, affinity-purified GST-PAX3. Western blot analysis using the p-Ser205 specific PAX3-antibody corroborated that BRAF directly phosphorylates PAX3 at Ser205 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, upper panel). To analyze the specificity of the p-Ser205 PAX3-antibody we performed in vitro kinase assays using the S201A, S205A, S209A and S222A PAX3-mutants as substrates. As expected all mutant PAX3 proteins, with the exception of S205A, reacted with the p-Ser205 PAX3 antibody after incubation with BRAF demonstrating specificity of the antibody (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, lower panel). Taken together, our results suggest that BRAF phosphorylates PAX3 at multiple sites but that phosphorylation at Ser205 is critical for efficient PAX3-dependent stimulation of muscle cell migration."

Interestingly, previous studies demonstrated that G-protein coupled receptor CXCR4 and GAB1 cooperate to control the development of migrating muscle progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vasyutina et al., 2005</a>). Since CXCR4 signaling, including induction of the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhao et al., 2006</a>), relies on activation of RAS/RAF while MET associated GAB1 activates the RAS-RAF route via the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Birchmeier et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Trusolino et al., 2010</a>), we would like to propose that important aspects of the cross-talk between the CXCR4 and MET/GAB1 signaling pathways are mediated by BRAF. However, we do not want to claim that BRAF solely exerts its effects downstream of MET. BRAF might also play an important role in other cellular signaling pathways, which is also supported by reduced expression of <i>Lbx1</i> in <i>Braf</i> mutant embryos but not after inactivation of <i>Met</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sachs et al., 2000</a>). Deletion of <i>Braf</i> impairs but does not completely abolish delamination of muscle progenitors as indicated by the appearance of small numbers of committed myoblasts and the formation of residual myofibers in limbs. Hence, additional experiments are needed to determine the contribution of other signaling pathways downstream of MET and CXCR4 and to unravel the whole complexity of signaling network required for migration of limb muscle precursor cells."

Since GRB2 is a well-known activator of RAS-RAF signaling it seems possible that loss of BRAF might also play a role at later stages of myogenesis, e.g. for generation of secondary myofibers. Moreover, PAX3, which is a target of BRAF mediated phosphorylation in the nucleus, was shown to activate the enhancer of the myogenic control factor <i>Myf5</i> in limb muscle progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bajard et al., 2006</a>), which raises the possibility that the MET-BRAF cascade affects muscle differentiation via <i>Pax3</i>-dependent control of <i>Myf5</i> expression.

Both administration of Dynasore and knockdown of <i>Eea1</i> abrogated the effects of BRAF on migration of myogenic cells and prevented accumulation of BRAF in the nucleus. Traditional models favor the view that receptors only signal at the plasma membrane and are inactivated by internalization. However, it has become clear that several receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR, PDGFR (<a href=\"#bib37\">Miaczynska et al., 2004a</a>), the insulin receptor (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ceresa et al., 1998</a>) and MET (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kermorgant et al., 2004</a>) signal after internalization from endosomal compartments. In fact, MET endocytic trafficking is required for the full activation of signals requiring GAB1, ERK 1/2, STAT3 and RAC1 (reviewed by (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barrow-McGee and Kermorgant, 2014</a>)). Upon ligand binding, MET undergoes rapid endocytosis and traffics through peripheral endosomes to accumulate on perinuclear endosomes. MET-induced activation of STAT3 within the perinuclear compartment allows efficient activation and nuclear accumulation of STAT3 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kermorgant and Parker, 2008</a>) suggesting that trafficking and \u2018endosomal signaling\u2019 of MET enables direct transfer of signaling complexes to their intended target (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miaczynska\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2004b</a>) thereby favoring distinct signaling events.

We reason that the low expression level of BRAF, the relatively low amount of BRAF in the nucleus and the dynamic regulation of intracellular localization might have prevented a prior detection of BRAF in the nucleus so far. In this context it is interesting to note that also other components of the signaling pathways downstream of MET undergo a cytoplasmic-nuclear transport including MKP-3 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Karlsson et al., 2004</a>), ERK1/2 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barrow-McGee and Kermorgant, 2014</a>), and STAT3, which in part rely on MET-induced activation within the perinuclear compartment (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kermorgant and Parker, 2008</a>) suggesting a common theme in the transfer of signaling complexes to their intended targets (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miaczynska\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2004b</a>)."

The functional relevance of PAX3 phosphorylation is largely unknown although the presence of phosphorylation sites at Ser201, Ser205 and Ser209 near the octapeptide domain, a region crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions and DNA binding suggests important regulatory functions. So far, two different kinases were identified to phosphorylate PAX3: GSK3\u03b2 and CK2. CK2 seems able to phosphorylate Ser205 and Ser209 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Iyengar et al., 2012</a>) while GSK3\u03b2 was found to phosphorylate Ser201, Ser205 and possibly Ser197 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kubic et al., 2012</a>). Since inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 in melanoma cells leads to cellular changes paralleling PAX3 inhibition, it was claimed that GSK3\u03b2 regulates proliferation and morphology of melanoma cells through phosphorylation of PAX3 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kubic et al., 2012</a>). We disclosed that BRAF phosphorylates Ser205, which is part of a cluster of serine residues (Ser187, Ser193, Ser197, Ser201, Ser205, and Ser209) required for efficient DNA binding of PAX3-FOX1A fusion proteins and necessary to institute the full transactivation potential of PAX3 in reporter gene assays (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amstutz et al., 2008</a>). Serine to aspartate conversions at these sites render the transcriptional activity of PAX3/FOX1A fusion proteins insensitive to the inhibitory actions of the kinase inhibitor PKC412, which inhibits growth of alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas carrying a <i>Pax3/Fox1A</i> translocation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amstutz et al., 2008</a>). Using a different assay to monitor activity of PAX3, we found that the S205A mutation significantly inhibited PAX3-dependent C2C12 muscle cell migration while S201A, S209A and S222A mutants had no discernable effects. Based on the published observation and our own findings it seems reasonable to assume that phosphorylation of Ser205 plays an important role in regulating the biological activity of PAX3. In fact, the octapeptide domain close to Ser205 mediates interaction of PAX3 with GROUCHO, which prevents transcriptional activation of PAX3 targets during melanocyte and neural cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Muhr et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, it seems possible that phosphorylation of Ser205 or other nearby sites prevents binding of GROUCO and thereby facilitates transactivation of PAX3 target genes, although we did not investigate this possibility. Since Ser205 is phosphorylated both by CK2, GSK3\u03b2 and BRAF, it is also tempting to speculate that several different signaling pathways contribute to phosphorylation of Ser205 and/or that a certain fraction of Ser205 is constitutively phosphorylated assuring a basic activity of PAX3, which is further enhanced by MET-dependent BRAF phosphorylation. However, we have to point out that we have demonstrated the critical role of Ser205 phosphorylation only in vitro in C2C12 cells and not in limb muscle progenitor cells in vivo. It is possible that different mechanisms operate in limb muscle progenitor cells than in C2C12 muscle cells, which differ in many aspects (e.g. expression of myogenic factors)."

We found that inhibition of ERK1/2 kinase did not affect BRAF-dependent stimulation of muscle precursor cell migration adding further support to the idea that BRAF exerts its activity on muscle cell migration not via the classical RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade but by direct phosphorylation and activation of PAX3. On the other hand, it seems possible that RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade contributes to the regulation of proliferation of fetal myoblasts and formation of secondary myofibers, which depends on MET adapter protein Grb2 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Maina et al., 1996</a>). The stimulation of PAX3 activity by MET via BRAF together with the previously reported activation of the <i>Met</i> promoter by PAX3 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Epstein et al., 1996</a>) suggest the existence of a positive feedback loop, which might be instrumental to maintain high levels of MET and PAX3 activity during limb muscle precursor cell migration (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Importantly, we found that activation of PAX3 by overexpression of WT and CA Braf (V600E) in C2C12 muscle cells results in marked up-regulation of <i>Met</i> and <i>Pax3</i>. Similarly, WT and CA Braf (V600E) increased the transcriptional activity of PAX3 in Luciferase reporter assays on HEK293T cells, which fits to the proposed role of PAX3 to stimulate <i>Met</i> expression in myogenic cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Epstein et al., 1996</a>) and to activate its own expression by direct positive autoregulation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Moore et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, activation of <i>Met</i> and <i>Pax3</i> expression by BRAF underscores the importance of BRAF in maintaining the MET-PAX3 feedback loop. It will be interesting to determine whether this loop and the signaling bypass created by BRAF-dependent PAX3 phosphorylation is also operative in other tissues and in cancer cells such as rhabdomyosarcoma and melanoma cells, which would offer new refined therapeutic approaches."

Peptide separation was carried out according to their hydrophobicity on an in-house packed 50 cm column with 1.9 mm C18 beads (Dr Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) using a binary buffer system consisting of solution A: 0.1% formic acid (0.5% acetic acid) and B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (80% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid). Linear gradients from 7\u201338% B in 150 were applied with a following increase to 80% B within 5 min and a re-equilibration to 5% B (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kruger et al., 2008</a>). MS spectra were acquired using 1E6 as an AGC target, a maximal injection time of 20 ms and a 70,000 resolution at 200 m/z. A Top10 method was applied for subsequent acquisition of higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation MS/MS spectra of the top 10 most intense peaks. Resolution for MS/MS spectra was set to 35,000 at 200\u00a0m/z, AGC target to 5E5, max injection time to 120 ms and the isolation window to 1.7 Th."

For protein assignment, spectra were correlated with the Uniprot human database (v. 2015) including a list of common contaminants. Searches were performed with tryptic specifications and default settings for mass tolerances for MS and MS/MS spectra. Carbamidomethyl at cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification, while oxidations at methionine, acetylation at the N-terminus were defined as variable modifications. The minimal peptide length was set to seven amino acids, and the false discovery rate for proteins and peptide-spectrum matches to 1%. The match-between-run feature with a time window of 1 min was used. For further analysis, the Perseus software (1.5.0.31) was used and first filtered for contaminants and reverse entries as well as proteins that were only identified by a modified peptide. The SILAC Ratios were logarithmized and grouped into duplicates and a one-sample t-test was performed. Probability values (p)&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant."

(2012) (see also Mayeuf et al., 2016) has shown that when VEGFR2 is knocked out in paraxial mesoderm, muscle progenitors from the lateral dermomyotome do not migrate into the limb bud. This paper thus assigned a seemingly crucial role to endothelial precursors in the subsequent migration of muscle progenitors into the limb. VEGFR2 signals among other things through Raf and the endothelial precursors present in the lateral dermomyotome would certainly be affected in the Pax3-Cre/B-Raf del/del. Can the authors rule out that the effect they observe here is not due to a problem of signaling downstream of Flk1? Obviously, the \"inhibition of HGF-mediated migration of myogenic cells by knockdown of Pax3\" (subsection \u201cB-Raf regulates muscle precursor cell migration through Pax3 phosphorylation\u201d) is not really a strong argument, since Pax3 is probably upstream of VEGFR2 as well."

(2012) (see also Mayeuf et al., 2016) has shown that when VEGFR2 is knocked out in paraxial mesoderm, muscle progenitors from the lateral dermomyotome do not migrate into the limb bud. This paper thus assigned a seemingly crucial role to endothelial precursors in the subsequent migration of muscle progenitors into the limb. VEGFR2 signals among other things through Raf and the endothelial precursors present in the lateral dermomyotome would certainly be affected in the Pax3-Cre/B-Raf del/del. Can the authors rule out that the effect they observe here is not due to a problem of signaling downstream of Flk1? Obviously, the \"inhibition of HGF-mediated migration of myogenic cells by knockdown of Pax3\" (subsection \u201cB-Raf regulates muscle precursor cell migration through Pax3 phosphorylation\u201d) is not really a strong argument, since Pax3 is probably upstream of VEGFR2 as well.</i> "

Furthermore, VEGFR2 (commonly known as Flk1 or KDR) is assumed to signal via the PKC-MAPK and the PI3K pathway although some evidence exists that Flk1 indeed might also activate MAPK via C-Raf and MEK in some cells types. Hence, it does not seem very likely that B-Raf plays a major role downstream of Flk1. Nevertheless, we investigated the possibility that indirect effects of B-Raf in endothelial precursor cells downstream of Flk1 might be important for migration of muscle progenitors into the limb. To approach this problem, we performed immunostaining of WT and B-Raf mutant embryos at E10.5 using antibodies against CD31, which identifies endothelial cells in the developing embryo. Similar to the situation in Pax3 mutant embryos, we did not observe a significant reduction of endothelial cells in B-Raf mutant limbs suggesting that B-Raf does not play a crucial role downstream of Flk1 for migration of endothelial precursor cells."
