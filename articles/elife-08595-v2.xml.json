Here, we investigate the evolutionary origins of adhesion and the emergence of groups of genealogically unrelated cells with a game-theoretical model. The considered adhesiveness trait is costly, continuous and affects both group formation and group-derived benefits. The formalism of adaptive dynamics reveals two evolutionary stable strategies, at each extreme on the axis of adhesiveness. We show that cohesive groups can evolve by small mutational steps, provided the population is already endowed with a minimum adhesiveness level. Assortment between more adhesive types, and in particular differential propensities to leave a fraction of individuals ungrouped at the end of the aggregation process, can compensate for the cost of increased adhesiveness. We also discuss the change in the social nature of more adhesive mutations along evolutionary trajectories, and find that altruism arises before directly beneficial behavior, despite being the most challenging form of cooperation."

Indeed, multicellular organisms such as plants and animals owe their existence to cooperation. Life on Earth was initially made up of single cells, some of which evolved the ability to stick to each other and work together to form tissues and organs. However, developing the ability to adhere to other cells costs energy that could otherwise be used by the cell to ensure its own survival and proliferation. How multicellularity emerged, despite such costs, remains puzzling, in particular in groups of cells that do not share a common ancestor."

Furthermore, the evolution of cohesive groups can arise just through the cells randomly interacting.

The existence of different levels of organization generates situations where a behavior that is beneficial for others is associated with individual costs, in terms of reproductive success. The ubiquity of genetically encoded traits that underpin cooperative behavior has thus long been considered an evolutionary paradox, as such traits should be purged by natural selection acting at the individual level. Such paradoxical situations appear in what are known as 'major evolutionary transitions' (<a href=\"#bib44\">Maynard-Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry, 1995</a>), an instance of which is the transition from autonomously replicating unicellular to multicellular organisms (<a href=\"#bib46\">Michod and Roze, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Wolpert and Szathm\u00e1ry, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sachs, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Rainey and Kerr, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Ratcliff et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hammerschmidt et al., 2014</a>). Evolutionary transitions all face the possibility that a part of the population free rides and exploits the collective benefit produced by the action of others. For instance, cancerous cells that divide faster disrupt the survival of their host (<a href=\"#bib20\">Frank, 2007</a>)."

In most game-theoretical and trait-group models, collective-level processes derive from individual-level behavior, and cooperation can be sustained by mechanisms that affect either population structure or individual decisions. The former mechanisms produce assortment between cooperators, arising for instance during group formation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Avil\u00e9s, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fletcher and Zwick, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Santos et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Guttal and Couzin, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Powers et al., 2011</a>) or due to limited dispersal (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nowak and May, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pfeiffer and Bonhoeffer, 2003</a>). The emergent topology of interaction makes cooperation profitable on average despite cooperators being outcompeted within every group, as exemplified by the so-called Simpson\u2019s paradox (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chuang et al., 2009</a>). The latter mechanisms are instead effective in random population structures and alter individual strategy enough to offset cooperation\u2019s cost. These mechanisms typically rely on players modifying their behavior conditionally to interactants\u2019 types. For instance, reciprocity (<a href=\"#bib81\">Trivers, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Nowak and Sigmund, 1998</a>), peer recognition (<a href=\"#bib1\">Antal et al., 2009</a>) and 'green beard' mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown and Buckling, 2008</a>) or policing (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boyd et al., 2003</a>) are all means by which individuals preferentially direct cooperation toward other cooperators, or retaliate against defectors. Such mechanisms require players to collect and interpret information about others, and are therefore better suited to model elaborate forms of cooperation, rather than the origin of cooperative groups themselves. Ultimately, all explanations for the evolutionary success of cooperative strategies rely on the fact that individual fitness depends on the social context, whether it is shaped by the population structure or the nature of the cooperative act."

Although capable of thriving in isolation, most unicellular species participate\u2014in parts of their life cycle, at least\u2014to multicellular aggregates that offer instances of \u2018intermediate\u2019 integration of cells into higher levels of organismality (<a href=\"#bib75\">Smukalla et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nadell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Queller and Strassmann, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Rainey and Kerr, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Ratcliff et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Celiker and Gore, 2013</a>). Microbial societies can be highly regulated, such as in the multicellular fruiting bodies of slime moulds and myxobacteria, where cells within the collective commit to a developmental program analogous to that of permanent multicellular organisms, including the soma-like 'suicide\u2019 of a part of the population. At a lesser degree of sophistication, many other forms of collectives are known in microbial organisms, ranging from colonies to biofilms (<a href=\"#bib29\">Grosberg, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nadell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Niklas, 2014</a>). A central feature of most microbial aggregates is their ability to persist long enough to affect the survival of their composing units. Such persistence is mediated by various forms of adhesion (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jiang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gresham, 2013</a>) ensuring local cohesion between cells of the same or different kind. For instance, cells that fail to completely separate at the moment of division are selected for in regimes favoring increased aggregate size (<a href=\"#bib67\">Ratcliff, 2013</a>), a feature reinforced by genetic homogeneity within groups (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nadell et al., 2010</a>). Although apparently an achievable initial step to foster multicellularity (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kirk, 2005</a>), incomplete division is however unlikely to be the only mechanism at play in the emergence of multicellular organization in the tree of life, as some biological populations form aggregates from dispersed cells and can be composed of multiple genetically distinct strains (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nanjundiah and Sathe, 2011</a>). Such cases turn out to be particularly challenging for the different theoretical solutions to the evolution of collective function (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tarnita et al., 2013</a>)."

By affecting group formation as well as the performance of a group, differential attachment is an established means to create positive assortment, which enables the concomitant evolution of adhesive traits and sizeable groups in idealized, well-mixed populations (<a href=\"#bib74\">Simon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Garcia and De Monte, 2013</a>) as well as more realistic, spatially explicit settings (<a href=\"#bib21\">Garcia et al., 2014</a>). These models address the binary competition between more adhesive \u2018cooperators\u2019 and less adhesive \u2018defectors\u2019 and demonstrate that segregation between types can be generated even if encounters among players occur at random. The stickier type is favored as soon as its frequency exceeds a threshold (<a href=\"#bib22\">Garcia and De Monte, 2013</a>), in spite of the costs associated with increased adhesion. In actual biological populations, however, social propensity needs not result from individual features that abide by a binary logic. For instance, the FLO1 gene governing flocculation in yeast is highly variable: the level of adhesion changes as a function of the number of tandem repeats within FLO1 (<a href=\"#bib75\">Smukalla et al., 2008</a>). This molecular mechanism may underpin a diversity of cell-cell interaction strengths that are better described as a trait with continuous, rather than discrete, values. In this context, the process of adaptation is mathematically formalized with the theory of adaptive dynamics (<a href=\"#bib23\">Geritz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Waxman and Gavrilets, 2005</a>), describing evolution as a mutation-substitution process where mutants successively invade a monomorphic resident population.

Similarly, the bacterium <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> expresses an extracellular protease that helps transform milk proteins into digestible peptides: <a href=\"#bib5\">Bachmann et al.

This paradox is typically modelled as a social dilemma involving two competing strategies: one 'social' (or 'cooperative') and one 'asocial' (or 'defective'). In this work, we model adhesiveness as a mechanism underpinning social behavior (<a href=\"#bib22\">Garcia and De Monte, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Garcia et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schluter et al., 2015</a>). Adhesiveness affects social interactions within groups, but also the formation of groups themselves. In the theoretical framework of adaptive dynamics, we describe the evolutionary trajectory of a continuous adhesion trait entailing a cost for its carrier. We address the very first steps in the emergence of collective behavior, as well as the long-term evolution of cohesive groups, in populations undergoing cycles of dispersal-aggregation-reproduction akin to those of facultatively multicellular microbes."

Benefits are equally shared between group members so that individual gains depend only on group composition, and not group size. Even ahead of its effects on reproductive success, adhesiveness structures the population during the aggregation phase, as it increases the probability of attachment upon interaction. These assumptions model a feature often associated with social behavior in microbial populations: the production of extracellular glues. Glues are individually costly, since their production diverts energy allocated to growth. At the same time, they enhance cohesion and resilience of multicellular aggregates, and thus the fitness of the constituent cells."

In parallel to the rise in adhesiveness, the eco-evolutionary feedback between population composition and structure sustains the gradual surge of group size. This provides a scenario for the transition from poorly (or incidentally) social populations with small or loose groups to highly social populations structured in large cohesive groups. Unlike models with binary strategies, the evolution of sociality is possible from rare mutations in adhesiveness: the stickier type does not need to overcome a frequency threshold."

Is this condition relevant to biologically realistic settings? Adhesiveness is a trait that is highly variable among microbial species, depending on the physical properties of the cell surface, as well as on the amount and quality of compounds they excrete. Directed selection experiments show that the secretion of extracellular products providing some kind of collective advantage\u2014such as polysaccharides improving the strength of aggregates and stress resistance\u2014can be achieved on a relatively fast time scale (<a href=\"#bib64\">Rainey and Rainey, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Xavier and Foster, 2007</a>).

If higher adhesiveness drives more effective crawling, increased dispersal and the subsequent genetic heterogeneity in multicellular chimeras might oppose the selection for collective function. The emergence of sociality in spite of spatial mixing has been addressed in a simple model where cells are described as interacting persistent random walkers (<a href=\"#bib21\">Garcia et al., 2014</a>). In this model, however, cell velocity and adhesiveness were independent parameters. Their concomitant variation might lead, in a spatially explicit setting, to insights on the conditions under which stable polymorphism is possible in a population with gradually evolving adhesiveness."

This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that, in our model, the fitness of an individual depends on the composition of the group it belongs to\u2014as opposed to the assumption in <a href=\"#bib17\">Dubravcic et al.

(2015)</a> and our model should be noted. When group formation is based on adhesiveness, lonely individuals occur also in the absence of temporal variation of the environment and of selective advantage due to dispersal. Moreover, in our model, being ungrouped is not a strategy determined by a fixed probability, as failure to join a group is contingent on the emergent population structure. A pivotal issue is thus when the decision to join groups is made by microbial organisms. Populations of facultatively multicellular species face two \u2019lotteries\u2019 where stochasticity affects the fitness of an individual: joining groups and, once in a group, reproducing or dying. If the trait under selection is, as in <a href=\"#bib17\">Dubravcic et al. (2014)</a> and <a href=\"#bib79\">Tarnita et al. (2015)</a>, the probability of staying alone, cells decide to be in a group before the fitness cost of giving up reproduction is possibly assigned. If it is adhesiveness, as in our model, social behavior in groups is decided at the same time as aggregative behavior. Experimental evidence suggests that conditions preceding the aggregation phase influence the partition between lonely and aggregated cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dubravcic et al., 2014</a>), and between stalk and spore cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gomer and Firtel, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jang and Gomer, 2011</a>). The role of adhesiveness itself in influencing such decisions is unknown. Further experiments are needed, together with models that explore the possible role of competition within aggregates, to clarify to what extent social interactions within the multicellular phase are linked to group size distribution, including singletons."

As a consequence, the nature of a directional change in the trait value can vary along an evolutionary trajectory, if it entails modifications in the average local interaction environment. We show that the status of mutations increasing adhesiveness can change along with the gradual evolution of the trait, even when benefit and cost parameters are fixed. When adhesion starts to increase, mutations are always altruistic, meaning that they entail a net cost to the individual compared to the resident trait. Nonetheless, these altruistic mutants thrive because of their role in the earlier aggregation phase. For large enough benefit-to-cost ratios, though, positive mutations become directly beneficial at a later time along the evolutionary trajectory. Altruistic behavior emerges first, and direct benefits only appear afterwards. This means that directly beneficial interactions, while frequently observed in nature, might not necessarily be the stepping stone for the evolution of cooperation, but rather an evolutionary endpoint."

The analytical version of the model is based on adaptive dynamics and therefore allows for the exploration of small changes to a continuous trait. The main findings are that adhesiveness can evolve to high levels via small steps and that this can be true even when the trait initially has a net cost (strong altruism), as opposed to weak altruism paving the way for strong altruism. Overall, the article seems very well written and interesting and could make an important contribution."

This is potentially an important contribution to the study of social behavior because it would show that pre-existing assorting forces are not necessary for sociality to evolve. However, in paragraph three, Discussion, one of the main conclusions of this study \u2013 where adhesiveness is a continuous trait \u2013 is that the evolution of sociality is possible from rare mutations. However, at the same time, they can't really evolve from scratch. There needs to be a threshold amount of adhesiveness present in the resident type for a more sticky one to evolve, as discussed in the subheading \u201cThe ecology of adhesive cells\u201d discussing why this is likely but I didn't find that discussion sufficiently persuasive. If the model shows that basically stickiness can't evolve from scratch, then how would there be a certain amount of stickiness present in the population to begin with? What are some examples where we expect this to have happened?"

It is described before the \"real\" model is described, and the simulation is described simply as a test of the \"robustness\" of the AD analysis. This seems backwards. The result of the AD analysis is not particularly interesting (limits at z=0 or z=1 depending on the starting point) and if AD was really the proper model then (as is pointed out many times in the paper) the process of increasing adhesiveness could never get started, due to the positive threshold that must be overcome. It seems the AD analysis is basically an interesting \"sanity check\" on the simulation model, that is valid in certain limiting cases. (The work of Champagnat in the reference, and elsewhere, shows just how \"hard\" it is to get an AD limit from a sequence of stochastic models.) This is not to make light of the nice analytical results in section 2, but we think it should be made clearer that the most important insights in the paper come from the computer simulation of the mathematically intractable versions of the model.

While this might seem at first sight a restrictive condition on b/c, one has to keep in mind that it is also the delimiting inequality of directly beneficial vs. altruistic cooperation in standard PGG models occurring in groups of fixed size T. Here, altruism may occur for even larger values of b/c because, contrary to fixed group-size models, a proportion of individuals remain alone as long as the adhesiveness level is smaller than 1. Therefore, marginal returns from sociality (that occur only in groups) are not obtained systematically while the cost is always paid, whether or not in a group. The delimiting b/c value for altruism (1/r<sub>alt</sub> in the manuscript) even diverges when adhesiveness is close to 0 as nobody gets in a group in such a case. As a consequence, a social mutation is always altruist for very small resident values of the adhesiveness."

It is thus hard to tell what is realistic. Maybe having a large return from the collective phase, or a low cost for adhesion, is realistic. We preferred to avoid advancing hypotheses on the degree of realism of different levels of benefit-to-cost ratios, and take as a reference the theoretical condition that is commonly used for populations structured in groups of equal size."

(I missed that detail in the first version, and its role in determining b/c ratios.) I don't think I understand the justification for this. If an extracellular matrix was the trait that caused adhesiveness and also benefited other group members, then loners might get at least some benefit from their own excretions of extracellular matrix. Also, one could imagine a different mechanism of adhesion that did not manifest itself unless a group was joined. In this case loners would not pay the cost. I would leave it up to the authors to decide whether providing some intuition behind this analysis decision is helpful.</i> "
