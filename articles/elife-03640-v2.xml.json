To identify functional translational readthrough, we estimated the readthrough propensity (RTP) of all stop codon contexts of the human genome by a new regression model in silico, identified a nucleotide consensus motif for high RTP by using this model, and analyzed all readthrough extensions in silico with a new predictor for peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1). Lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) showed the highest combined RTP and PTS1 probability. Experimentally we show that at least 1.6% of the total cellular LDHB is targeted to the peroxisome by a conserved hidden PTS1. The readthrough-extended lactate dehydrogenase subunit LDHBx can also co-import LDHA, the other LDH subunit, into peroxisomes. Peroxisomal LDH is conserved in mammals and likely contributes to redox equivalent regeneration in peroxisomes."

To identify functional translational readthrough, we estimated the readthrough propensity (RTP) of all stop codon contexts of the human genome by a new regression model in silico, identified a nucleotide consensus motif for high RTP by using this model, and analyzed all readthrough extensions in silico with a new predictor for peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1). Lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) showed the highest combined RTP and PTS1 probability. Experimentally we show that at least 1.6% of the total cellular LDHB is targeted to the peroxisome by a conserved hidden PTS1. The readthrough-extended lactate dehydrogenase subunit LDHBx can also co-import LDHA, the other LDH subunit, into peroxisomes. Peroxisomal LDH is conserved in mammals and likely contributes to redox equivalent regeneration in peroxisomes."

When a stop codon enters the ribosomal A site, release factors bind the stop codon, hydrolyze the peptidyl-tRNA bond, and trigger the release of the polypeptide from the ribosome. If instead of release factor 1 (eRF1), a near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA pairs with the stop codon in the ribosomal A site, the stop signal is suppressed. Such decoding of a stop codon as a sense codon is known as translational readthrough. As a consequence, translation continues to the next stop codon resulting in the synthesis of C-terminally extended proteins (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baranov et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Namy et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Firth and Brierley, 2012</a>).

A case of translational readthrough dependent on RNA cis-elements has recently been found and termed programmed translational readthrough (PTR) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eswarappa et al., 2014</a>). But it is also known that the stop codon itself and the nucleotides before and after the stop codon affect readthrough. The three stop codons differ in their tendency to be suppressed. In human, UAA is least and UGA is most likely to allow readthrough (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beier and Grimm, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Baranov et al., 2002</a>). Studies also show that the nucleotide immediately downstream of the stop codon is biased and can strongly influence readthrough (<a href=\"#bib39\">McCaughan et al., 1995</a>). We here define translational readthrough that is entirely dependent on the stop codon and the nucleotides in its immediate vicinity as basal translational readthrough (BTR). Thus BTR is independent of cis-acting elements and also differs from pharmacologically induced readthrough. Induction of readthrough, most prominently by aminoglycoside antibiotics, is an attractive strategy in the treatment of the large number of genetic disorders caused by premature stop codons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bidou et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Keeling et al., 2014</a>)."

To achieve this aim, we concentrated on proteins deriving from BTR. Based on experimental data, we assigned regression coefficients to all possible nucleotides in the stop codon context (SCC) and, using those regression coefficients, estimated the readthrough propensity (RTP) of all stop codons in the human genome or transcriptome. We were able to formally derive a new nucleotide consensus for high RTP from the regression coefficients of our model. Then we screened all predicted C-terminal extensions for peroxisomal targeting signals because peroxisomes import most of their matrix proteins through a short targeting signal (PTS1) at the very C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib51\">Smith and Aitchison, 2013</a>). We here show that lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) combines a very high translational readthrough with a hidden, yet functional and evolutionarily conserved, PTS1. This peroxisomal isoform of LDH, containing the readthrough-extended LDHBx subunit, is likely to be involved in the regeneration of redox equivalents for peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation."

In order to calculate linear regression between the SCCs and their experimental BTR values, we formalized SCCs using a binary vector that represented the stop context in a multi-dimensional vector space (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The three stop codons were condensed into one position, so that the binary vector required 51 dimensions, for the four possible nucleotides in the six positions before and after the stop codon, and for the three stop codons (12 \u00d7 4 + 3). The vector was combined with experimentally accessible BTR frequencies. For the first approximation model (LIN), we used 66 sequences derived from human nonsense mutations (<a href=\"#bib16\">Floquet et al., 2012</a>). The nucleotide sequences of these stop contexts show no bias with respect to RTP, because the contexts and the stop codons evolved independently, and therefore the context nucleotides are random in relation to the stop codon. We calculated a linear regression model for these SCCs and used only the experimental BTR values that had been measured in the absence of aminoglycosides. The model assigns regression coefficients to all possible nucleotides in the stop context (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

For experimental analysis, SCCs spanning 10 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the stop codon were expressed with a 5\u2032/N-terminal yellow fluorescent protein (Venus) and a 3\u2032/C-terminal humanized Renilla luciferase (hRluc) tag. Stop suppression leads to the expression of hRluc, and Venus served as an internal expression control. Readthrough is expressed as luciferase activity per Venus fluorescence. This approach excludes introns and exon junction complexes and, due to the relatively short stretch of variable nucleotides between the reporters, also does not allow for extensive RNA structures that could modulate readthrough. Consequently, this form of the dual reporter assay focuses on the assessment of BTR not influenced by specific cis-elements. The additional candidates tested showed BTR between 0.10% (\u00b10.006%) and 2.91% (\u00b10.15%) relative to the 100% readthrough control expressing the Venus-hRluc fusion protein without an intervening stop codon region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The aminoglycoside antibiotic geneticin (G418) increased readthrough by between 3.25 (\u00b10.41) and 40.38 (\u00b15.33)-fold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Geneticin could only increase the luciferase-per-Venus signal when a stop codon separated Venus and luciferase, indicating that our dual reporter assay faithfully reports readthrough. The finding that experimental readthrough could be increased by treatment with aminoglycosides also excludes alternative mechanisms such as RNA editing or splicing that might explain the relative increase of the luciferase over the Venus signal. The highest levels of induction can only be reached when basal readthrough is low, and, vice versa, a high BTR somewhat limits the maximum induction factor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), suggesting that maximal BTR readthrough is limited to levels below 15%."

The quantitative manner in which we derived LINiter values allowed us to rationally derive a nucleotide motif permitting high readthrough in humans. We identified the nucleotide positions with the strongest influence on BTR in humans by feature selection, that is by successively eliminating those positions that contribute least to the prediction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). One by one the nucleotide positions with the smallest sum of squared regression coefficients were removed from the model. We find that two reduced models improve the prediction. Models with either five or three relevant context positions in addition to the stop codon correspond to the local and global residual error minimum, respectively. LINfs5 comprises nucleotide position \u22126, the stop codon, and positions +4 to +7, and LINfs3 comprises only the stop codon and positions +4 to +6, that is the codon following the stop (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The results of this analysis indicate that in humans the stop codon and the three nucleotides immediately downstream of the stop codon have the largest influence on BTR (LINfs3). The corresponding consensus is <span class=\"underline\">UGA</span> CUA (stop codon underlined). Possibly also the nucleotides at positions +7 (the fourth position after the stop) and \u22126 contribute to BTR. The RTP-BTR correlation associated with LINfs3 was 0.41 (p = 0.0001) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To test if the LINfs3 consensus indeed confers high BTR, we analyzed four additional candidate SCCs. Three high-RTP SCCs were derived from AQP4, SYTL2, and CACNA2D4, and DHX38 was used as a control with a low RTP. AQP4, SYTL2, and CACNA2D4 conform with the LINfs3 consensus, whereas DHX38 does not. AQP4, SYTL2, and CACNA2D4 showed 2.29% (\u00b10.09%), 0.99% (\u00b10.06%), and 0.61% (\u00b10.02%) readthrough in HeLa cells, whereas for DHX38 readthrough was only 0.27% (\u00b10.04%) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), confirming that LINfs3 SCC indeed allows a very high rate of stop suppression. Next we wanted to test if these conclusions obtained in HeLa cells can be extended to other cell types. We therefore performed dual reporter experiments using the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line, the human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK), and the U373 cell line. In all these experiments, the relative distribution of BTR values remained the same, with AQP4 showing the highest and DHX38 the lowest BTR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The finding that readthrough is lower in CACNA2D4 than in AQP4 and SYTL2 can also be taken as evidence that SCC position +7 (fourth after the stop) makes a contribution. Taken together, these experiments show that BTR is indeed a property of the respective SCC, and that readthrough may be differently regulated in different tissues."

An overview of all experimentally confirmed cases of translational readthrough shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> reveals that ribosome profiling, phylogenetic approaches, and RTP screening are complementary approaches.

This targeting mechanism had been shown to divert a small fraction of cytosolic glycolytic proteins to peroxisomes in fungi (<a href=\"#bib17\">Freitag et al., 2012</a>). PTS1 cover more than 90% of the targeting motifs of peroxisomal matrix proteins. The alternative PTS2 is found in only very few matrix proteins, and has even been lost in some organisms (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lanyon-Hogg et al., 2010</a>). PTS1 is localized at the very C-terminus of a substrate protein. However, the quintessential PTS1, Ser-Lys-Leu (SKL), is neither necessary nor sufficient to support matrix protein import into peroxisomes. Variations exist, and amino acids upstream of the terminal tripeptide also contribute to targeting (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brocard and Hartig, 2006</a>). Moreover, PTS1 does not confer a binary decision (to import or not to import), but is likely to determine an equilibrium between cytosolic and peroxisomal localization. This is best exemplified by the peroxisomal marker protein catalase, a considerable amount of which is not imported into peroxisomes due to an inherently weak PTS1 which is associated with low affinity to the cytosolic PTS1-receptor PEX5 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Maynard et al., 2004</a>). We took advantage of these scalable properties of PTS1 and adapted to human PTS1 a prediction algorithm that we had previously developed for plants (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lingner et al., 2011</a>). This machine learning-based method has been shown to accurately predict proteins with canonical and non-canonical PTS1 peptides and provides evidence for peroxisome targeting in terms of a posterior probability (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lingner et al., 2011</a>)."

                                "text": "The identification of LDHB as virtually the only human protein with a high combined readthrough and peroxisomal targeting probability is surprising, because a peroxisomal readthrough-extended LDHBx entails at least one new LDH isoform. On the other hand, LDH activity and isoforms inside peroxisomes were known for more than four decades (<a href=\"#bib41\">McGroarty et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Osmundsen, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">V\u00f6lkl and Fahimi, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baumgart et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">McClelland et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gronemeyer et al., 2013</a>). In the apparent absence of known targeting signals, however, it has not been possible to explain how the protein can enter the peroxisome. Therefore we conducted an investigation to determine whether the extended human LDHBx protein and the predicted PTS1 therein lead to peroxisomal localization. We expressed LDHBx as a fusion protein with an N-terminal enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and co-labeled cells by immunofluorescence with the peroxisomal marker PEX14, a peroxisomal membrane protein. YFP-LDHB showed the expected cytosolic localization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5A</a>). We hypothesized that a large excess of cytosolic YFP-LDHB masks the peroxisomal localization of LDHBx. To remove cytosolic YFP-LDHB, we permeabilized cells by digitonin before fixation and washed out the cytosol using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In agreement with peroxisomal targeting through the cryptic PTS1, LDHBx is found localized in peroxisomes after removal of the cytosol (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B and 5B</a>). In control experiments, we show complete removal of cytosolically expressed YFP by cytosol wash-out (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and peroxisomal localization of a YFP variant fused to PTS1 of the peroxisomal matrix protein ACOX3 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To confirm that LDHB targeting to peroxisomes is dependent on the putative PTS1 in the readthrough extension, we changed the SRL terminus (PTS1 probability 94.3%) to SSI (0.002%) and to SR (\u0394L, 0.00001%). These mutations blocked YFP-LDHBx targeting to the peroxisome (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4C and 5C\u2013F</a>). Remarkably, exchange of the leaky UGA stop with the tighter UAA reduced peroxisomal localization of YFP-LDHB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Our results show that the high-RTP SCCs as well as the PTS1 in the extension after the stop codon are needed for peroxisome targeting. The extension must be accessible to ribosomal translation and contain a functional PTS1. It is known that PTS1-dependent targeting guides proteins into peroxisomes and not only to the membrane. The dependence of LDH targeting on the hidden PTS1 and on the nature of the stop codon thus confirms that the protein is indeed inside the peroxisome. As expected, replacing the stop codon by tryptophan-encoding UGG renders LDHBx entirely dependent on the PTS1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>)."

We confirmed these results in human skin fibroblasts, COS-7 cells (monkey kidney fibroblast line), the human glioblastoma cell line U118, and freshly prepared rat cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Our data are in agreement with readthrough-dependent targeting of about 1.6% of the LDHB to peroxisomes mediated by the cryptic PTS1 in the extension. Remarkably, treatment of untransfected wild-type HeLa cells with geneticin increased LDHBx levels in the peroxisome (induction factor 1.89, n = 28, <i>t</i> test p &lt; 0.0001) suggesting elevated peroxisomal LDHBx levels as a general pharmacological consequence of aminoglycoside treatment."

We therefore wanted to test if peroxisomal LDHBx piggy-backs LDHA into peroxisomes. For this purpose we adapted a two-hybrid assay previously used to analyze co-import of subunits of the dimeric peroxisomal hydrolase Lpx1 in a heterologous system (<a href=\"#bib53\">Thoms et al., 2011</a>). When LDHA was expressed as a fusion protein with N-terminal YFP without co-expression of any form of LDHB, the protein localized to the cytosol as expected (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). However, when we co-expressed YFP-LDHA with CFP-LDHBx[TGG], that is cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fused to the readthrough form of LDHB, we found YFP-LDHA in peroxisomes (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). This experiment shows that the readthrough form of LDHB, LDHBx, can interact with LDHA, and that LDHBx is capable of carrying LDHA into the peroxisome. To show that co-import of LDHA is dependent on the hidden targeting signal in LDHBx, we mutated the targeting signal to SSI, or we deleted the terminal leucine. Either LDHBx PTS1 mutation blocked co-import of LDHA (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The peroxisome is thus accessible to all four new LDH isoforms containing LDHBx. To support our data on LDHBx-LDHA co-import, we drew a structural model of the LDH-1 tetramer, the fundamental all-B isoform of LDH (<a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The C-terminal amino acid leucine is extended by three amino acids not resolved in the structure, and, in LDHBx, by an additional seven amino acids. The model shows that this extension protrudes from the tetramer and is located distal to the protomer-interaction site, confirming that oligomerization is not hampered by the extension. The protruding LDHBx extension carrying the PTS1 is also accessible on the tetramer surface for PEX5 binding and import into the peroxisome."

For import into the peroxisome, at least one C-terminus has to bind to the soluble PTS1 receptor PEX5.

This mechanism has been termed programmed translational readthrough (PTR) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eswarappa et al., 2014</a>). It is known, however, that the stop codon together with the preceding and immediately following nucleotides (SCC) also influence translational readthrough. We have termed this process basal translational readthrough (BTR) to distinguish it from PTR in general, and also from pharmacologically induced readthrough. In this study we derive a motif conferring high BTR from a linear regression model of SCCs and show that LDHBx undergoes BTR, which in turn affects the intracellular distribution of LDH."

Now we find that readthrough-extended LDHBx is encoded by the well-known <i>LDHB</i> gene by translational stop suppression and can give rise to new isoforms. Peroxisomal LDH is a novel isoform of LDH containing at least one readthrough-extended LDHBx subunit. LDHB readthrough and readthrough-dependent peroxisomal localization are evident in various human cell types, suggesting that the LDHBx subunit is expressed and localized to peroxisomes in all tissues that express LDHB.

Recently, two powerful and complementary methods have been employed in the genome-wide identification of readthrough-extended proteins. Ribosome profiling can recognize translating ribosomes in 3\u2032UTRs and thereby identify readthrough and other recoding events outside known coding regions (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dunn et al., 2013</a>). Phylogenetic approaches such as those implemented in PhyloCSF (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lin et al., 2011</a>) evaluate the coding potential of sequences before and after the stop codon to help predict readthrough and are particularly powerful when genome sequences from closely related species are available (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jungreis et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Loughran et al., 2014</a>). Ribosome profiling, however, depends on gene expression, and can identify readthrough events only when the cell type in question is actually analyzed. Ribosome profiling may also fail to identify short readthrough extensions. Phylogenetic approaches, on the other hand, may miss readthrough when it is not conserved in the given dataset or when sufficiently dense datasets are not available, or when the extensions are too short to provide a basis for phylogenetic comparison."

The LINfs3 motif, derived by feature selection, encompasses the stop codon and the first codon after the stop: UGA CUA. Our analysis suggests that positions +7 and \u22126 might also further contribute to readthrough. We have tested five of the 144 candidates in the genome with the UGA CUA motif and confirmed their high BTR. Highest BTR appears to correlate with a G in position +7 (UGA CUA G) within the LINfs5 consensus. This motif is found 30 times in the human genome and has recently been shown to support high translational readthrough (<a href=\"#bib36\">Loughran et al., 2014</a>). The motifs for high BTR are distinct from the consensus UGA CAR YYA (R = A/G, Y = C/U) found in some viruses and yeast (<a href=\"#bib43\">Namy et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Harrell et al., 2002</a>) but resembles the alphavirus-like high readthrough stop codon context (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li and Rice, 1993</a>). Interestingly, the same stop suppression context in the <i>LAMA3</i> gene has been shown to alleviate the disease severity of an otherwise fatal nonsense mutation in a patient with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, the major and most devastating form of epidermolysis bullosa (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pacho et al., 2011</a>)."

                                "text": "The existence of the consensus motif UGA CUA is the origin of the non-linear contribution to RTP in our models. This is supported by the finding that correlation of BTR and RTP for LINfs3 is higher than for the LINiter model, so that the reduced number of parameters in LINfs3 provides a better model fit. This finding implies that with the currently small dataset, compact linear models should be preferred over non-linear models with many parameters. The identification of the few relevant nucleotide positions will help to create datasets with fully specified BTR for a wide range of SCCs and cell types. A larger training set of sequences with verified readthrough rates will allow the development of non-linear approximation models."

The 18-nucleotide extension in LDHBx is unlikely to contain a extensive secondary structure that would suggest a combined effect of BTR and PTR. The identification of LDHBx and the recently discovered readthrough form of vascular endothelial growth factor A, VEGF-Ax (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eswarappa et al., 2014</a>), thus mark two extreme and separable cases of physiological stop suppression: LDHBx appears independent of cis-factors beyond the SCC and marks a prototypical example of BTR. In contrast, the readthrough of VEGF-Ax is relatively independent of its SCC but instead requires a more distantly located cis-element (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eswarappa et al., 2014</a>). The distinction between PTR and BTR, however, is not exclusive. A thorough analysis of readthrough in OPRK1 and OPRL1 indicates that readthrough levels of more than 30% can be obtained by a combination of cis-elements and UGA CUA-based BTR (<a href=\"#bib36\">Loughran et al., 2014</a>)."

Afterwards, the starting sequences and putative orthologs were pooled and sequences with uncommon PTS1 tripeptides, that is tripeptides which occurred less than three times, were removed from the set. The resulting set of sequences was used as positive examples for training machine learning models as previously published (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lingner et al., 2011</a>). Briefly, a regularized least-square classification algorithm was trained using indicator vector representations of up to 15 C-terminal amino acids of positive and negative example sequences. A set of negative example sequences was created by extracting all metazoan sequences without peroxisomal association from the Swiss-Prot section of UniProt (<a href=\"http://www.uniprot.org/\">http://www.uniprot.org</a>) in November 2011. The best model (15 C-terminal amino acids) was determined by fivefold cross-validation and yielded a prediction accuracy of 0.996 and 0.863 in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (auROC) and the area under the precision/recall curve (auPRC), respectively.

The resulting quantitative predictor, called the RTP score, was initially derived from published data on aminoglycoside-promoted readthrough efficiency and further developed by the use of dual reporter readthrough assays. You find provocative correlations of expression and readthrough, i.e., genes that are highly expressed have a lower RTP score, whereas genes that are expressed at low levels have higher RTP scores. By coupling the RTP predictor with a peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS) prediction algorithm you sought genes that have high scores for RTP as well as PTS. This approach identified a new isoform of LDHB that arises from the readthrough of the normal termination codon resulting in translation of a C-terminally extended protein product harboring the peroxisomal targeting sequence. Monitoring the subcellular localization of the appropriate fluorescent fusion proteins validated this conclusion."

However, there are major concerns with the paper. One problem is the fact that the function for LDHBP+ in the peroxisome is only postulated, not formally demonstrated (for example, by a loss-of-function experiment or by clinical data). Another major problem is the molecular mechanism involved (please see below). Another concern relates to the repeated claims that the RTP models are \u201ca quantitative predictor for readthrough propensity in the human genome,\u201d which are not supported by a clear, quantitative analysis of RTP performance. Because RTP is a major focus of the manuscript, you should provide additional analyses to substantiate these claims.

However, it appears that all of these assays used by the authors have the traditional format that excludes any introns. This may be a significant problem since deposition of EJC proteins appears to play a key role in translational efficiency (Wiegand et al [2003] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100: 11327-11332; Gudikote et al. [2005] Nature Struct Mol Biol 12: 801-819; Nott et al. [2004] Genes Dev 18: 210-222). The latter experiments raise the possibility that the lack of introns/EJC proteins may affect readthrough efficacy.

[Cell 157, 1405-18 (2014)] reported programmed translational readthrough (PTR) in the vascular endothelial growth factor A. This study gave us the opportunity to explain our intentions and the focus of our work in more detail. In their study, Eswarappa et al. investigate a case of programmed translational readthrough, which is dependent on a 63 nucleotide cis-element in the transcript. Remarkably, this case of PTR is relatively independent on the stop codon and its context. In contrast, our work focuses on the ability of the stop codon and its context (stop codon context, SCC) to stimulate translational readthrough. To distinguish this type of readthrough from PTR, we now define this SCC-dependent readthrough as basal translational readthrough (BTR). BTR differs also from pharmacologically induced readthrough. The distinction between PTR and BTR might help to explain why the experimental readthrough values vary over a large range with PTR reaching levels of 10, 30, or even 60% for some genes, while BTR does not seem to exceed 1.5 to 5%. In the latter case, readthrough is entirely dependent on a natural stop codon and the nucleotides in its immediate vicinity, whereas PTR involves cis-elements and trans-factors that can enhance readthrough to a large extend. 1.5% BTR may appear low from the perspective of a PTR-regulated gene, but considering that stop codons usually permit less than 0.13% readthrough, this is an at least 10-fold increase. And for the case of LDHB+P (which we now term LDHBx) we provide evidence that it has a biological function. The distinction between PTR and BTR is not to imply that both are mutually exclusive. Another recent study by Loughran et al. [NAR; <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gku608\">doi 10.1093/nar/gku608</a> (2014)] investigates cases of what is probably a combination of both.

Indeed, we analyzed SCCs, and all of the RTP calculations are entirely based on the regression coefficients of the few nucleotides of the SCC. We do not take into account that cis-sequences or secondary structures within the extension could contribute to readthrough. As stated above, Eswarappa et al. [Cell 157, 1405-1418 (2014)] recently published complementary work by analyzing one example of programmed translational readthrough (PTR), dependent on a 63 nucleotide cis-element 3\u2019 of the stop codon. In contrast, our work concentrates on basal translational readthrough (BTR), which is defined here as being independent of genetic elements outside of the nucleotides surrounding the stop codon. We have identified an SCC motif that leads to high basal translational readthrough (BTR). We also provide evidence that this element acts independently of cis-acting factors in the case of the dual reporter constructs (absence of EJC, responsiveness to aminoglycosides, mutational analysis). The RTP calculation in our study is not based on \u201caminoglycoside-promoted readthrough efficiency\u201d. We only used \u201cbasal\u201d readthrough efficiency, which is non-induced readthrough by definition. Also the BTR levels measured by us for inclusion in the iterative model are non-induced (but inducible!), so they were recorded in the absence of readthrough-inducing drugs, indicating that they are entirely dependent on the SCC. While the inducibility of the signal in the assay sufficiently proves that it is real readthrough (because e.g. splicing is not induced by aminoglycosides), we cannot exclude that some of the genes with high BTR are additionally influenced in translational efficiency by introns/EJC. For the case of LDHBx, however, this is unlikely, due to the quantitative correspondence of LDH activity in the peroxisome with readthrough propensity and its very short extension."

Numerous descriptions in the literature indicate that any protein can enter peroxisomes when it interacts with a protein that is imported into peroxisomes [eg. McNew et al. TiBS 21, 54-58 (1996), Thoms et al. J Struct Biol 175, 362-371 (2011)]. The two-hybrid assay is based on this co-import and uses LDHA fused with the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in combination with LDHBx fused to the C-terminus of the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP). We show that overexpressed YFP-LDHA can only enter the peroxisome, when CFP-LDHBx is co-expressed (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). When we mutate the targeting signal of LDHBx in the extension, LDHA cannot enter the peroxisome any more (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). We checked if the amino acid extension present in LDHBx could potentially interfere with the interaction of LDHB with LDHA. To answer this question, we now show the structure of tetrameric LDH in <a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2013figure supplement 2</a>. The C-termini of LDHB are at the very surface of LDH with maximum distance from the interaction surface of the protomers. We can conclude the following from this analysis: (1) The (extended) C-terminus of LDHBx is unlikely to interfere with the oligomerization in the tetramer, and (2) the C-terminal extension is easily accessible to the peroxisomal import receptor PEX5 that must bind the short PTS1 contained in the additional amino acids. If the extension was buried inside the protein, it could affect conformation of LDHBx to interfere with LDHA binding, and the extension would be inaccessible to PEX5, and thereby LDHBx-containing oligomers could not be targeted to the peroxisome."

We not only identify a (cryptic) peroxisomal targeting signal, and peroxisomal localization of a protein, but also provide evidence for readthrough-dependent targeting to the peroxisome. We show that targeting (1) occurs in untransfected cells; (2) is dependent on the stop codon: UAA, a tighter stop codon than UGA, abrogates targeting, whereas UGG, a sense-mutation of the stop, improved targeting; and (3) that aminoglycoside \u2013treatment increases the amount of LDH in the peroxisome.

We are certain that alternative splicing does not occur that close to the stop codon, because alternatively spliced transcripts would be included in the Ensembl database and as such would have been subject of our genome-wide <i>in silico</i> screen. Perhaps the most convincing argument ruling out RNA editing or splicing is our finding that the apparent readthrough is strongly induced (in some cases more the 40-fold) by aminoglycosides in the SCC as well as in the full-length experiments. Neither RNA editing nor splicing are known to be stimulated by these drugs."

                    "text": "Our data and experiments contain negative controls in the sense that we have included many genes with low RTP and therefore a low BTR, for example PPP1R3F (0.18%), or PRDM10 (0.13%), or THG1L (0.15%) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Following the reviewers\u2019 suggestion, we have now included a new negative control that is even better suited than a luciferase-less control to establish the background levels: We use a construct that has two successive stop codons. This construct shows a BTR of 0.13%, indicating that this is the background level below we cannot distinguish between readthrough and experimental noise. As we neither want to obscure this fact, nor do we want to artificially scale our data, we decided not to subtract this value in the BTR measurement. Instead we indicate the background level in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> by a red line. As stated above, due to the specific form of the dual reporter assay we are using, cis-element dependent readthrough cannot be the origin of the readthrough levels we are measuring. The high-RTP consensus emerged from data that was in no way primed to readthrough, so we are confident (even if we cannot prove it), that readthrough of more than 5%, depending on the cell type, cannot be obtained by BTR. For PTR (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eswarappa et al., 2014</a>, and probably also Dunn et al., even though the latter study does not analyze the mechanism leading to readthrough) there seem to be no upper limit of readthrough levels, depending on the type of cis-elements and trans-acting factors, even 100% readthrough seem possible. Again, we are very thankful that the reviewers\u2019 comments have given us the opportunity to distinguish between cis-element dependent readthrough (PTR) and SCC-dependent readthrough (BTR). It is clear that BTR can (Loughran et al.) but need not (Eswarappa et al.) be modulated by PTR. And, as stated above and below, the BTR of approx. 1.5% for LDHBx is not low, because, as we explain in the Discussion, it leads to a roughly equal distribution of LDH in the peroxisome and in the cytosol. With higher readthrough, the peroxisomal LDH activity would exceed the cytosolic! Regarding our prediction of readthrough for all human transcripts we are aware that many of the listed RTP values correspond to what could be interpreted as the \u2018baseline\u2019 of measurable BTR. We are also aware that negative RTP values are somehow counter-intuitive, as they would suggest a negative BTR, which is not possible. Here, a calibration of RTP values to BRT probabilities by means of, e.g., analysis of the distribution of RTP scores could help to assess more intuitively interpretable RTP values. However, with the limited dataset and the apparent nonlinear dependence of BTR on the SCC a calibration is not possible at the moment. A workaround would be to just include the first 144 (consensus) sequences in Dataset 1 (or trim the list according to the first negative control or an arbitrary threshold), but we feel that readers could be interested in the complete list. (Another possibility for avoiding negative RTP would have been to use \u201cconstrained\u201d estimation methods, i.e. methods that avoid negative coefficients. However, for our first approach we wanted to use the simplest methods possible to take into account the limited number of sequences.) We hope that extended datasets of BTR measurements and nonlinear methods in the future will provide improved RTP values."

The Pearson correlation for both models is significant but weak with the LINfs3 model showing a slightly higher correlation (0.41, p=0.0001) than the LINiter model (0.34, p=0.0022). This suggests that the LINfs3 model with its only 15 parameters is more suitable for our purpose than the LINiter model with 51 parameters.

As detailed above, we provide evidence that these rates are entirely dependent on the SCC and do not require cis-elements or trans-factors. Considering our finding that readthrough of some of the LINfs3 consensus candidates are at least 10-fold above the physiological background, we do not think that, from the perspective of a stop codon and its\u2019 usual function to stop translation, these are low rates. It is clear that the RTP approach would miss any cases of readthrough that is independent of the stop codon, and we now state this more clearly in the Introduction, the Results and in the Discussion. Overfitting: we are aware that the number of 66/81 sequences represents the lower limit for a multivariate regression on 51 dimensions. However, with that knowledge in mind we deliberately restricted our analysis to linear models, applied a rigorous model validation using a leave-one-out strategy and performed a feature selection procedure to further reduce the number of model parameters (to 15 in the case of LINfs3). The fact that we could identify the relevant position of the SCC as well as the consensus motif for high RTP assured us that our model generalizes as good as possible for linear approaches. Furthermore, we pave the way for future extended datasets that now can be built by concentrating on the relevant SCC positions. This reduces the number of experiments for fully specified BTR assessment based on the SCC considerably (from 4^12*3 \u223c 50,000,000 to 4^3*3=192) and will allow the application of nonlinear models for RTP prediction. The additional experiments we have added to test the LINfs3 consensus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) suggest that the predictions derived from one cell type in principle can be applied to another, although the overall level of BTR may differ between cell types."
