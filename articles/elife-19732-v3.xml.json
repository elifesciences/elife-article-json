Previously we have demonstrated that hPSC-derived human lung organoids (HLOs) resembled human fetal lung tissue in vitro (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dye et al., 2015</a>). Here we show that HLOs required a bioartificial microporous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffold niche for successful engraftment, long-term survival, and maturation of lung epithelium in vivo. Analysis of scaffold-grown transplanted tissue showed airway-like tissue with enhanced epithelial structure and organization compared to HLOs grown in vitro. By further comparing in vitro and in vivo grown HLOs with fetal and adult human lung tissue, we found that in vivo transplanted HLOs had improved cellular differentiation of secretory lineages that is reflective of differences between fetal and adult tissue, resulting in airway-like structures that were remarkably similar to the native adult human lung."

Previously we have demonstrated that hPSC-derived human lung organoids (HLOs) resembled human fetal lung tissue in vitro (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dye et al., 2015</a>). Here we show that HLOs required a bioartificial microporous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffold niche for successful engraftment, long-term survival, and maturation of lung epithelium in vivo. Analysis of scaffold-grown transplanted tissue showed airway-like tissue with enhanced epithelial structure and organization compared to HLOs grown in vitro. By further comparing in vitro and in vivo grown HLOs with fetal and adult human lung tissue, we found that in vivo transplanted HLOs had improved cellular differentiation of secretory lineages that is reflective of differences between fetal and adult tissue, resulting in airway-like structures that were remarkably similar to the native adult human lung."

These advances stem from our ability to culture primary human tissues and derive complex three-dimensional organ-like tissues, called organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dedhia et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fatehullah et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Johnson and Hockemeyer, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Huch and Koo, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rookmaaker et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dye et al., 2016</a>). Both tissue-derived and hPSC-derived human lung models have been developed and recapitulate some structural and cellular features of the human lung (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barkauskas et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rock et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gotoh\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Konishi et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vaughan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pageau et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fessart et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Franzd\u00f3ttir et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kaisani et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dye et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Firth et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mou et al., 2016</a>). For example, we recently described methods to direct differentiation of hPSCs in a stepwise process, which mimicked aspects of in vivo\u00a0lung development, into three-dimensional human lung organoids (HLOs). HLOs possessed closed epithelial cysts resembling airway-like structures, which consisted of epithelial cells primarily expressing ciliated and basal cell markers. The airway-like structures were surrounded by mesenchyme, including cells expressing smooth muscle and myofibroblast markers (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dye et al., 2015</a>). Despite having airway-like organization around a lumen, the HLO epithelium was disorganized and did not possess some cell types found in the mature airway, including club and goblet secretory cell lineages. Consistent with in vitro\u00a0differentiated HLOs being immature, transcriptome-wide comparisons showed that HLOs were similar to the human fetal lung (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dye et al., 2015</a>)."

Human intestinal organoids (HIOs), for example, are an in vitro three-dimensional model of the human intestine derived from hPSCs that closely resemble the fetal intestine. When transplanted under the mouse kidney capsule, HIOs mature and gain relevant adult structures including villi and crypts (<a href=\"#bib15\">Finkbeiner et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Watson\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Finkbeiner et al., 2015a</a>).

The tHLO airway structures were vascularized, and surrounded by mesenchymal cells that expressed both smooth muscle and myofibroblast markers, in addition to areas of organized cartilage.

A similar strategy was employed in an attempt to engraft and mature HLOs, in which several different experimental conditions and engraftment sites were attempted utilizing NSG mice. Experiments were initially conducted using the hESC line UM63-1, and all major findings were reproduced in two additional hESC lines; H1 and H9 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Data presented throughout the manuscript are from the hESC line UM63-1, unless otherwise stated. In our first attempt, 35d (35 day old) HLOs were placed under the kidney capsule and were harvested after 4 weeks (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). The retrieved organoids expressed the human-specific mitochondria marker (huMITO), but lacked NKX2.1+ lung epithelium (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). We hypothesized that an earlier stage of HLO cultures may be more proliferative and therefore have better survival upon engraftment. 1d HLOs were injected under the kidney capsule (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). After 6 weeks, the tissue had expanded, surpassing the size of the kidney (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Further analysis demonstrated that the tissue was of human origin (huMITO+), but no NKX2.1+ epithelium was observed (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Thus, the age of transplanted\u00a0HLOs did not seem to affect the survival of the HLO lung epithelium."

In order to prepare PLG-HLO constructs for transplant, HLOs were suspended in Matrigel and pipetted onto the scaffolds. 1d HLOs were able to adhere to the pores on the scaffold, with the majority of the HLOs scattered across the 5\u00a0mm diameter surface, and a few towards the middle of the 2\u00a0mm thick scaffold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). HLO-seeded PLG scaffolds were subsequently cultured for 5 to 7 days in vitro submersed in 500\u00a0ng/mL FGF10 supplemented media, the same media used to grow HLOs in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Dye et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Following 5\u20137 days of culture, constructs were transplanted directly, or dipped in Matrigel supplemented with FGF10 (500\u00a0ng/mL) prior to transplantation. Both conditions were transplanted into the mouse epididymal fat pad (Matrigel/FGF10\u2009n\u00a0=\u00a08; without Matrigel/FGF10\u2009n\u00a0=\u00a04, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>). In both conditions, 100% of the recovered constructs possessed NKX2.1+ airway-like structures (n\u00a0=\u00a012 total) (Characterized in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), suggesting that the addition of Matrigel/FGF10 prior to transplant was not necessary, but that the scaffold provided critical support for engraftment and survival of the lung epithelium. The epididymal fat pad was chosen as the site for transplantation because it was the only site able to accommodate the large size of the scaffold-HLO construct while still providing a highly vascular environment. As a control, 1d HLOs in a Matrigel plug (without being placed on a scaffold) were transplanted into the epididymal fat pad but no tissue was recovered at 8 weeks post-transplant (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We also demonstrated that HLOs generated from three independent hESC lines (H1,\u00a0H9, UM63-1) developed similarly following transplantation on scaffolds (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Collectively, these data demonstrated that PLG scaffolds provide a robust niche,\u00a0enabling HLOs to engraft and survive in the epididymal fat pad."

We observed that each transplanted HLO had multiple epithelial structures per cross section. To further characterize the in vivo\u00a0grown HLOs, we quantified the total number of epithelial structures (ECAD+) per cross-section and found that 86.19% of all ECAD structures were also NKX2.1+ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,I</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The histology of the transplanted tissue revealed airway-like structures tightly surrounded by mesenchymal cells. In addition, there were pockets of organized cartilage throughout the transplants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Epithelial structures were verified to be of human origin using huMITO and the human-specific nuclear marker HUNU (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J\u2013K</a>). As a control, 1d HLOs were seeded on the scaffold and grown in vitro\u00a0for 4 to 8 weeks. These in vitro\u00a0grown HLO-scaffolds had significantly less growth, and although some cells expressed the lung marker NKX2.1, no airway structures were observed (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). This is possibly due to the fact that HLOs grown in vitro are normally embedded in Matrigel and passaged every two weeks whereas tissue grown on the scaffolds could not be passaged, and were not embedded in Matrigel. Thus, results from in vitro\u00a0grown scaffold-HLO constructs suggest that the scaffold alone does not support long term HLO growth or induce the\u00a0enhanced epithelial organization or maturation, but the combination of the scaffold and the in vivo\u00a0environment allows for growth and maturation of the HLO epithelium."

Native lung airways are organized into a SOX2+ pseudostratified epithelium with basal and multiciliated cells being the most prevalent cell types in the airway (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mercer et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Morrisey and Hogan, 2010</a>). Both non-transplanted HLOs and transplanted HLOs expressed the airway marker SOX2; however, tHLOs on scaffolds formed a highly organized pseudostratified epithelium, including taller ECAD+ cells that had a clearly visible apical and basal surface similar to the adult human airway (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; Note that adult human airways examined are consider lower bronchi as detailed in the Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The average cell height \u2013 from the apical to basal surface \u2013 of cells lining the tHLO airway-like lumen was similar to adult lungs while the non-transplanted HLOs grown in Matrigel had significantly shorter cells than the tHLOs and adult lungs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Micro-dissected tube-like structures were stained for FOXJ1 and P63 using whole-mount immunostaining, followed by confocal imaging (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Whole-mount imaging revealed tube-like structures with abundant FOXJ1 and P63 expressing cells. P63+ cells appeared to line the basal surface of the tube, while FOXJ1 appeared to be located closer to the lumen. A cross section through a three-dimensional rendered airway revealed that the structure had a lumen lined by FOXJ1+ cells, while P63+ cells lined the outside of the tube along the basal side of the airway-like tissue. This organization was similar to the upper airways in the adult and fetal human lung (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Although several tube-like structures were observed, micro-dissection was very disruptive, and did not allow accurate quantitation of the number of these structures. Thus, it is likely that not all airway-like structures were shaped as a tube, and cyst-shaped airway structures are also present within the transplants. In the adult airway and fetal upper airway sections, the majority of the cells facing toward the lumen express the ciliated cell marker FOXJ1 and are multiciliated, demonstrated by ACTTUB staining (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>.\u00a0In vitro\u00a0grown HLOs have scattered cells that express FOXJ1 and few disorganized cells that are multiciliated as shown by ACTTUB immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,D</a>).

We had previously reported that HLOs grown in vitro possessed rare cells expressing low levels of the club cell marker CC10 and we did not detect cells expressing MUC5AC protein, which is found in goblet cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dye et al., 2015</a>). We asked if the lack of differentiated secretory cell types reflected an immature stage of development by comparing cellular differentiation in human adult and fetal airways. In adult airways, cells expressing the club cell markers CC10 and PLUNC and cells expressing the goblet cell marker MUC5AC were scattered throughout the airway (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Similar to the adult airway, we observed that the tHLO epithelium had distinct CC10+, PLUNC+, and MUC5AC+ cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>). Further quantification of secretory cells in multiple tHLOs (n\u00a0=\u00a09 independent transplants) revealed biological heterogeneity across samples. On average 45.55% of all NKX2.1+ airways contained CC10+ secretory cells and 70.43% contained MUC5AC+ secreting cells, however; variability ranged from some individual tHLOs possessing no secretory cells (n\u00a0=\u00a02/9 possessed no CC10+; n\u00a0=\u00a01/9 possessed no MUC5AC+) to 100% of all airway structures within an individual tHLO possessing secretory cell types (n\u00a0=\u00a01/9 CC10+; n\u00a0=\u00a03/9 MUC5AC+) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Highly organized airway-like structures with multiple cell types (P63+ basal, ACTTUB+ multiciliated, CC10+ club and MUC5AC+ goblet cells) were also observed in tHLOs derived from the H9 and H1 cell lines, indicating that maturation of airway-like structures upon transplantation is reproducible across multiple cell lines (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, airway-like structures transplanted for different lengths of times (8 weeks, 15 weeks) appeared similar in epithelial organization and in expression of mature airway markers (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that in vivo\u00a0grown tHLOs possess airway-like epithelium with basal, ciliated, goblet, and club cells in a highly organized pseudostratified epithelium that resembled both the structure and cellular diversity of adult human airways."

Tissue grown on an air-liquid interface generated an organized pseudostratified epithelium that reflects most of the cellular diversity of the human airway (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mou et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wong\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2012</a>), while other models possess an airway epithelium with a supporting mesenchyme (<a href=\"#bib16\">Firth et al., 2014</a>). Previous work has also shown that lung epithelial cells derived from hPSC monolayers transplanted underneath a mouse kidney capsule can further differentiate into cells expressing airway and alveolar markers over a period of six months (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2013</a>). However, it was unclear how robust this approach was, and whether this yielded tissue with any degree of organization. To our knowledge, the work presented here is the first to show that hPSC-derived HLOs are able to engraft in vivo and differentiate into an organized pseudostratified airway-like epithelium with a complete repertoire of airway cell types and supporting mesenchyme, along with a vascular supply and the ability to survive for long periods of time. Interestingly, our findings demonstrated that despite the fact that in vitro grown HLOs possessed alveolar cell types, we found no evidence of alveolar cells or alveolar structure in tHLOs. Given that the alveolar cell types present in HLOs were few in number, it is possible that these cells were not abundant enough to persist in vitro, or alternatively, that PLG scaffolds did not promote their survival. Ongoing studies are aimed at better understanding how to generate these distal airway structures."

For example, decelluarized lung scaffolds have been employed to seed primary and derived lung tissue in order to provide an appropriate physical and structural environment and in attempts to generate lung-like tissue (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dye et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gilpin et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Booth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ghaedi et al., 2014</a>). Many efforts have focused on seeding alveolar tissue including alveolar type I and II cells onto acellular matrices (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gilpin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Booth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ghaedi et al., 2014</a>), and lung tissue derived from mouse embryonic stem cells seeded on decellularized rat lung matrix enhanced maturation of airway cell types and epithelial organization (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shojaie et al., 2015</a>). Our data previously demonstrated that in vitro\u00a0grown HLOs seeded onto an adult human decelluarized lung matrix allowed adherence of the HLO epithelium to the airway matrix and resulted in the\u00a0differentiation of a small number of multiciliated cells, but did not enhance club or goblet cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dye et al., 2015</a>). Collectively, our data along with the data from decelluarized lung scaffolds suggest that providing an ideal physical environment may be an important factor for promoting tissue organization and differentiation, but that additional cues will also be required for full tissue maturation."

The microfluidic devices allow are designed to mimic the microenvironment of the airway, and can include controlled media flow and multiple cell layers including human primary epithelium, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sellgren et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Benam\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2016</a>). These in vitro\u00a0systems successfully mimic the microenvironment of an airway, but are designed for small scale and high throughput applications. In contrast tHLOs are an in vivo\u00a0system that may be more appropriate for low-throughput disease modeling or for pre-clinical drug testing, which has a great unmet need for better models that more accurately mimic human tissue in both healthy and diseased states in order to improve prediction of drug efficacy. This is particularly true for diseases that affect the lung, in part because commonly used animal models do not faithfully recapitulate several key aspects of the human disease (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moore and Hogaboam, 2008</a>). Moreover, there is generally a poor track record of accurately predicting which drugs will work in humans based on pre-clinical animal models (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ruggeri et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mak et al., 2014</a>), as up to 80% of drugs that pass pre-clinical tests fail in humans (<a href=\"#bib42\">Perrin, 2014</a>). A prime example of this is in lung disease where many therapies have shown benefit in mouse models, but only 2 of these have shown benefit in humans (<a href=\"#bib39\">Myll\u00e4rniemi and Kaarteenaho, 2015</a>)."

Future directions will be aimed at exploiting this new in vivo\u00a0model of the human airway to better understand disease and to improve human health."

Analyses conducted on human adult airways were carried out on sections through the lower bronchi of the upper airway, defined by the lack of adjacent cartilage and pseudostratified, undulated epithelial architecture. Analysis of human fetal airways was carried out on sections through bronchi and/or bronchioles of the upper airway at a level where the\u00a0adjacent cartilage was present. Immunostaining was carried out as previously described (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rockich et al., 2013</a>). Antibody information and dilutions can be found in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. All images and videos were taken on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope or an Olympus IX71 epifluorescent microscope. Imaris software was used to render Z-stack three-dimensional images."

Using a combination of organoid culture with matrigel and scaffold, the layered epithelium they achieve in vivo closely parallels human airway. The imaging and especially the polarity and organization of the cell types they have achieved is quite remarkable. This technique, if as reproducible and efficient as reported, could advance the field for the study of lung disease."

Such a concern is very valid in a field where variability is often not addressed adequately (or at all in some cases), and we appreciate the opportunity to improve our manuscript with additional data to help paint a transparent picture of the transplanted lung organoid system that we are describing. We will note that for the revision, we have added transplant from another cell, bringing the number of different cell lines used to three (H1, H9, UM63-1), (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). While the absolute number of airway-like epithelium structures varied widely amongst individual transplants (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>), we will note that 100% of transplants examined from all three cell lines possessed at least some airway-like epithelium. Thus, we feel that using three different cell lines, and a total of n=19 individual constructs transplanted into different mice for at least 8 weeks, with 100% of these possessing some airway-like epithelium, that we have rigorously tested the robustness of this system."

Note that at the time of generating data for revisions, we had tissue sections left from only 9 transplanted HIOs (out of 12 total). To conduct the quantitation, we did co-staining for NKX2.1/ACTTUB, NKX2.1/CC10 and NKX2.1/MUC5AC. We then calculated percent of NKX2.1+ epithelial structures that were also positive for the co- stained markers. In the plotted data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), each individual transplanted construct is presented as a different color, so that the reader can get an idea of the percent of co-staining that was present in each transplant. Since multiciliated cells are abundant in human airways, we only considered an NKX2.1+ structure to be an airway-like structure when most/all of NKX2.1+ region contained multiciliated cells indicated by ACTTUB staining (appearing similar to staining in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Co-staining with ACTTUB and NKX2.1 revealed that 61 of 63 airways counted in 9 constructs had 100% of airway-like structures with co-staining of NKX2.1/ACTTUB similar to that shown in confocal images throughout the manuscript. As the reviewers suggested (see below), secretory cells were more rare, and were observed in a more variable fashion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Nonetheless, this analysis supports that individual NKX2.1+ epithelial structures within tissue sections are not \u201cpatchy\u201d \u2013 that they largely resemble mature airways and are populated with abundant multiciliated cells, and to a lesser extent, also possess secretory cells."

Following discussions with Dr. White, our clinical collaborator, for purposes of this manuscript, we are defining upper airways as anything above the terminal bronchioles in the lungs. Given that smaller bronchioles have fewer secretory cells, and given that we did not see evidence for secretory cells in the fetal lung tissue we examined, we confirmed that the fetal lung images we used were from upper airways in which cartilage condensations are present. We feel that this landmark (cartilage) ensures that we are in an area within the upper airway that will eventually give rise to secretory cells."
