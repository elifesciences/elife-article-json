Currently, little data exist pertaining to peptides that are presented after <i>T. gondii</i> infection. Herein we purify HLA-A*02:01 complexes from <i>T. gondii</i> infected cells and characterize the peptide ligands using LCMS. We identify 195 <i>T. gondii</i> encoded ligands originating from both secreted and cytoplasmic proteins. Surprisingly, <i>T. gondii</i> ligands are significantly longer than uninfected host ligands, and these longer pathogen-derived peptides maintain a canonical N-terminal binding core yet exhibit a C-terminal extension of 1\u201330 amino acids. Structural analysis demonstrates that binding of extended peptides opens the HLA class I F\u2019 pocket, allowing the C-terminal extension to protrude through one end of the binding groove. In summary, we demonstrate that unrealized structural flexibility makes MHC class I receptive to parasite-derived ligands that exhibit unique C-terminal peptide extensions."

Currently, little data exist pertaining to peptides that are presented after <i>T. gondii</i> infection. Herein we purify HLA-A*02:01 complexes from <i>T. gondii</i> infected cells and characterize the peptide ligands using LCMS. We identify 195 <i>T. gondii</i> encoded ligands originating from both secreted and cytoplasmic proteins. Surprisingly, <i>T. gondii</i> ligands are significantly longer than uninfected host ligands, and these longer pathogen-derived peptides maintain a canonical N-terminal binding core yet exhibit a C-terminal extension of 1\u201330 amino acids. Structural analysis demonstrates that binding of extended peptides opens the HLA class I F\u2019 pocket, allowing the C-terminal extension to protrude through one end of the binding groove. In summary, we demonstrate that unrealized structural flexibility makes MHC class I receptive to parasite-derived ligands that exhibit unique C-terminal peptide extensions."

This analysis revealed that the parasite somehow manipulates the HLAs to carry parasite fragments that are considerably longer than can be explained with our current knowledge of how HLAs work.

The majority of peptide ligands identified to date are derived from parasite surface proteins, proteins localized to dense granules, or the rhoptry proteins which are specialized secretory granules whose contents are released either into the host cell cytoplasm or the parasitophorous vacuole (<a href=\"#bib2\">Blanchard et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cardona et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cong et al., 2011</a>).

While a majority of peptides are 8\u201311 amino acids in length, MHC I molecules present a considerable number of peptides &gt;11 amino acids (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hassan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schittenhelm et al., 2014</a>) that elicit T-cell responses (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hassan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Burrows et al., 2006</a>). Structural characterizations suggest that these long ligands interact with the MHC I molecule much like canonical peptides: The MHC I alpha chain forms a 10 x 25 angstrom groove in which peptide ligands are anchored by their second (P2) and C-terminal (P\u2126) residues. In this mode of binding, the middle portion of any oversized peptides can bulge out of the MHC I groove and interact with the receptors of T lymphocytes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tynan et al., 2005</a>). Crystallographic studies have confirmed this bulging model, although there exists a structural example of a 10mer interacting with MHC I molecule HLA-A2 via P2 and P9 with an amino acid extension at P10 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collins et al., 1994</a>). Thus, both peptide extension and peptide bulging have been observed for MHC I ligands, and, as longer ligands become increasingly evident, the interaction of these ligands with MHC I will need to be clarified."

HLA-A*02:01 was purified from cells infected with <i>T. gondii</i> and peptide ligands eluted from the HLA class I (human MHC I) complex were analyzed by two-dimensional LCMS. The resulting data demonstrate that nearly 200 ligands originating from close to 100 different <i>T. gondii</i> proteins are sampled for MHC I presentation. As envisioned, a number of ligands originating from dense granule proteins was observed (<a href=\"#bib2\">Blanchard et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cong et al., 2011</a>), yet MHC I ligands were also derived from a large number parasite cytoplasmic proteins. Surprisingly, <i>T. gondii</i> ligands were significantly longer than existing structural models can accommodate, and a series of peptide analogs demonstrated that these longer peptides are not anchored to MHC I via their C-termini. Crystallographic studies reveal an unreported structural re-arrangement of residues in the MHC I binding groove that accommodate C-terminal peptide extensions, and this structural flexibility is discussed in the context of infection by intracellular pathogens."

A steady increase in the number of free parasites in the culture media from day 1 to 7 was indicative of a productive infection. The production of 12 mg HLA-A*02:01 from infected cells was sufficient for a comprehensive analysis of <i>T. gondii</i> peptide ligands."

In our dataset, the 195\u2009<i>T. gondii</i> ligands identified originate from 95 different proteins of which 87 are non-GRA proteins, demonstrating that a considerable number of proteins are accessible to MHC I presentation. For 55.8% of the <i>T. gondii</i> source proteins a single peptide was presented (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), while elongation factor 1 alpha provided 12 peptide ligands. Peptide ligand enrichment from particular proteins was not due to protein length as median protein lengths were not statistically different (Kruskal-Wallis test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.247) regardless of the number of ligands embedded within a protein (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Amongst the proteins sampled more than once, a hierarchy emerged whereby several hypothetical proteins were most frequently sampled followed by the dense granule proteins, ribosomal proteins, EF1\u03b1, tRNA synthetases, and HSP70, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). All together, multiply sampled <i>T. gondii</i> source proteins provided 44.2% of the pathogen-derived ligands.

A subsequent search revealed nested core sequences of 8\u201311 amino acids within the longer peptides that were not predicted to bind, and these cores were predicted to bind to HLA-A*02:01. Strikingly, a considerable number (52/78) of the predicted non-binders contained nested core sequences of 8\u201311 amino acids that were predicted to bind with high affinity (percentile rank score &lt;=2%).

As YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR harbors a Leu at P9 and at P10, it could be that either Leu can serve as an F\u2019 pocket anchor for HLA-A*02:01 and when the P10 was changed to an acidic residue like L10E, the P9 Leu was used as the F-pocket anchor. In summary, the binding core\u2019s F-pocket residue is critical for long-peptide binding to HLA-A*02:01 such that C-terminal amino acid extensions of these longer ligands somehow protrude out of the groove in the vicinity of the F-pocket."

The melting temperature (Tm) for the two extended ligands exceeded 62\u00b0C (YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR, Tm = 66\u00b0 C, FVLELEPEWTVK Tm = 63\u00b0C), temperatures that are consistent with ligands of conventional length (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hassan et al., 2015</a>). The Tm of these extended ligands are also within the range of 15\u00a0mers that are reported to 'bulge' in the central portion of HLA-A*02:01 binding groove (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hassan et al., 2015</a>). It was somewhat surprising that these extended ligands had Tm representative of canonical ligands, and more remarkable was that the thermostability of the binding cores was at least 10\u00b0C higher (YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR, \u0394Tm = 10\u00b0C, FVLELEPEWTVK \u0394Tm = 12\u00b0C) than their extended counterparts (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

Both peptides bound in a zig-zag fashion in order to accommodate the core 11 amino acids in the antigen-binding groove (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). The 11 amino acid core of extended ligand FVLELEPEWTV<span class=\"underline\">K</span> interacts with HLA-A*02:01 in an almost identical manner to the shorter peptide, however, both the main chain and side chain of C-terminal Lys12 protrudes out the end of the binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Electron density for both peptides was very well defined over the entire peptide length (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D</a>). The N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid residues of the peptide provide the majority of H-bond and van der Waals contacts (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>). When attention was shifted to the F- pocket of HLA-A*02:01, with the shorter peptide this pocket was closed by the side chains of Thr80 and Tyr84 with Lys146 of the MHC I providing a lid or cover above the F pocket thereby burying the peptide\u2019s C-terminal 11<sup>th</sup> residue underneath (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,E</a>). However, for HLA-A*02:01 in complex with FVLELEPEWTV<span class=\"underline\">K</span>, the side chain of Tyr84 swung up and out by almost 90 degrees (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,F</a>), opening the binding groove so that a peptide might protrude from the groove at its C-termini. At the same time, Thr80 adopted a different rotamer, further opening the MHC I pocket toward the end of the \u03b11-helix. Lastly, there was a subtle but noticeable increase in the main chain distance between the \u03b1 1 and \u03b12-helices at the F\u2019 pocket (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>). Together, these structural changes opened the F\u2019 pocket and allowed Lys12 of the peptide to protrude from the pocket."

While the authors anticipated the structural changes necessary to allow a peptide to protrude from the F\u2019 pocket, the reported structure shows a minor structural change where Tyr84, the key player in opening the F\u2019 pocket, rotates slightly but does not swing out, and Thr80 did not change its rotamer. A slight movement of the Lys146 side chain, which appeared to be sufficient to allow the small C-terminal glycine to stick up, was reported (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>). However, in this previously reported model, amino acids other than glycine could not extend from the F\u2019 pocket due to steric clashes with the MHC I. Here, we have identified a previously unreported mechanism that allows pathogen-encoded C-terminally extended peptides to protrude out the end of the MHC I binding grove at the F\u2019 pocket. The binding cores of these C-terminally extended peptides interacts with MHC I using the same peptide register of canonical MHC I binders."

Indeed, the secreted dense granule proteins are the best-characterized source of peptides for presentation by MHC I, and our study confirms these proteins provide a number of MHC I ligands (<a href=\"#bib2\">Blanchard et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cardona et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cong et al., 2011</a>). However, many of the ligands we observe originate from non-secreted proteins, including parasite cytoplasmic proteins. Enrichment in these proteins is unexpected given that most <i>T. gondii</i> cytoplasmic proteins are not secreted and their cellular location should sequester them from the MHC I peptide processing machinery. Further, we identified many hypothetical proteins sampled by MHC I. Proteomic data had previously been reported for all but one of these hypothetical proteins, and our data substantiates that these proteins are expressed by the tachyzoites within the infected host (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gajria et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Treeck et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Xia et al., 2008</a>). Additionally, a little less than half (10/22) of the hypothetical proteins contain a predicted secretion signal sequence. These data represent a substantial contribution to understanding patterns of <i>T. gondii</i> gene/protein expression and demonstrate that secreted as well as non-secreted tachyzoite-expressed proteins are accessible to host antigen presentation processes."

Consistent with this, we found a dramatic C-terminal bias in the <i>T. gondii</i> derived ligands. However, it was completely unexpected that host-derived ligands in the infected cell would also display a C-terminal bias. Gene ontology annotation analysis indicated no bias in the cellular location of the source proteins for these C-terminal ligands (data not shown), so it does not appear to be a protein\u2019s location within the cell that results in a C-terminal processing bias. How <i>T. gondii</i> is mediating this intracellular alteration in antigen processing and presentation is therefore an unsettled question, and it will be interesting to see if protein ligand sampling is also biased in the closely related parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>."

                        "text": "One of the most striking observations in this study is that infection leads to the MHC I presentation of <i>T. gondii</i> ligands that are longer than baseline host ligands. Most ligands of considerable length are thought to be anchored to the B\u2019 and F\u2019 pockets of the MHC I groove via the peptide\u2019s P2 and P\u03a9 side chains, respectively. In such models the long peptide ligands exhibit a central bulge in order for the MHC I groove to accommodate the length of the extra residues (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hassan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tynan et al., 2005</a>). Consistent with this model, several long <i>T. gondii</i> ligands identified follow this P2/P\u03a9-anchor means of binding to MHC I. Rather unexpectedly, a group of long ligands did not follow this model but instead were predicted to bind via a canonical N-terminal binding core preceding the aforementioned C-terminal extension. A review of published ligand elution data confirms that C-terminally extended peptides are presented by membrane-bound HLA-A*02:01(<a href=\"#bib26\">Hassan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Scull et al., 2012</a>), yet the considerable number of extended ligands observed in this in vitro model of <i>T. gondii</i> antigen processing and presentation merits future confirmation in vivo. That notwithstanding, structural support for the binding of extended peptide ligands in HLA-A*02:01 can also be found (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collins et al., 1994</a>). In this example the nonamer binding core of a calreticulin peptide is extended by a single C-terminal amino acid that fits within the MHC I groove, yet this model was not consistent with <i>T. gondii</i> ligands that had as many as 30 C-terminally appended amino acids. In order to resolve this enigma, an HLA-A*02:01 crystal was solved with F<span class=\"underline\">V</span>LELEPEWT<span class=\"underline\">V</span>K and with a version of this ligand minus the C-terminal K. This led to the unprecedented observation that the C-terminal lysine at P12 displaced the Tyr84 residue at the end of the HLA-A*02:01 binding groove. As such, Tyr84 emerged as a \u201cswinging gate\u201d whereby a longer <i>T. gondii</i> peptide extended straight out the end of the HLA molecule at its C-terminus when Tyr84 assumed an alternate up and out position \u2013 the open gate. With the shorter peptide the Tyr84 was positioned down and in, assuming the traditional closed-groove orientation. A Tyr84 in the open position is consistent with several extended <i>T. gondii</i> ligands and a number of host ligands. This structural configuration is distinct from c-terminal extensions previously reported with C-terminal extension of covalently linked peptides (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mitaksov et al., 2007</a>) and predicted configurations (<a href=\"#bib28\">H\u00f6rig et al., 1999</a>) where the peptide travels up and over Tyr84. Note that Tyr84 modestly rotated to facilitate the reported binding of calretulin to HLA-A*02:01 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collins et al., 1994</a>), and the gate-open displacement of Tyr84 observed here confirms that the MHC I binding pocket is less rigid than previously realized. Importantly, this method of binding appears to be a major mechanism by which <i>T. gondii</i> and peptides are bound and presented in contrast to host-derived peptides where this mode of binding significantly less frequent."

                        "text": "The increased frequency of extended peptides following infection suggests that <i>T. gondii</i> ligands emerge from a distinct pathway of antigen processing and presentation. Class I MHC peptide ligands are typically derived from the proteasomal degradation of cytosolic proteins, active transport by TAP into the lumen of the ER, further proteolytic trimming in the ER, and chaperone mediated loading into class I MHC prior to egress to the plasma membrane. In the case of <i>T. gondii</i>, parasites are contained within a fusion resistant parasitophorous vacuole (PV), making it necessary that alternative mechanisms contribute to <i>T. gondii</i> protein degradation, transport, and trimming prior to presentation. Current evidence shows that <i>T. gondii</i> proteins secreted into the PV can be retrotransolcated via the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) complex from lumen of the PV to the host cytosol where they are routed to MHC I (<a href=\"#bib2\">Blanchard et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Feliu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Grover et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gubbels et al., 2005</a>). This process of presenting canonical peptide ligands from exogenous non-cytosolic proteins by class I MHC is referred to as cross-presentation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blanchard and Shastri, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Grotzke and Cresswell, 2015</a>). The extended <i>T. gondii</i> ligands observed here do not seem to fit this model of cross-presentation as their C-terminal extensions suggest a lack of interaction with proteolytic agents of the host cytosol and as many <i>T. gondii</i> ligands are derived from proteins not secreted into the PV. Rather, infected cells seem to exhibit a distinct means of cross-presentation, almost as though extended ligands move directly from the PV or the pathogen itself to the host\u2019s ER, forgoing exposure to carboxypeptidases found in the cytosol that are otherwise absent from the lumen of the ER. Indeed evidence of a semi-permeable channel between the PV and the ER might explain the presentation of extended peptides (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goldszmid et al., 2009</a>). However it is that ligands of unusual length reach class I MHC, future studies of T cell immunogenicity to <i>T. gondii</i>, and possibly to other large intracellular pathogens, must factor the distinct environment of the infected cell into the identification of immune epitopes."

Studies of peptides that are naturally processed and presented by the MHC I of mammalian cells have historically used healthy, or uninfected, cells to provide the baseline understanding for how antigens are made available for immune recognition. A foundation has emerged whereby peptide ligands of 9 amino acids are enveloped into an MHC I binding groove such that the central portions of the peptide ligand are available for review by adaptive immune receptors, and a legion of structural and functional data support this paradigm. Here we see that thousands of peptide ligands harvested from the MHC I of infected cells also fit this canonical antigen processing and presentation model, but in parallel we observe that alternate and unanticipated mechanisms result from infection and play a role in making <i>T. gondii</i> available for immune recognition. That long ligands can extend from their C-termini in a linear fashion out the end of what was previously recognized as a closed MHC I groove was unexpected. Our findings raise a plethora of important questions that must now be addressed, including whether other large intravacuolar pathogens such as <i>Plasmodium</i> and <i>Mycobacterium</i> species mediate similar changes to MHC I ligand presentation, how infection remodels host cell biology to facilitate the delivery of long extended ligands to MHC I, and the impact that unconventional ligand presentation has on adaptive immune responses to infected cells."

Briefly, peptide pools were fractionated using high pH off-line reverse phase HPLC. Each fraction was dried, resuspended in 10% acetic acid, and placed into an Eksigent NanoLC 400 U-HPLC auto sampler system (Sciex). Approximately twenty percent of each fraction was injected onto a nano-LC column and eluted with a linear acetonitrile water gradient at low pH (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yaciuk et al., 2014</a>). Eluate was ionized with a nanospray III ion source and analyzed with a 5600 Triple-TOF mass spectrometer (Sciex). Survey and fragment spectra for all fractions were analyzed using PEAKS (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc) and were searched against NCBInr database using <i>Homo sapiens</i> (ID: 9606) or <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> (ID: 5811) taxonomy filters. For <i>Homo sapiens</i> searches a 1% FDR was applied and for <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> a 2% FDR was used. All <i>T. gondii</i> unmodified peptide sequences were confirmed with fragmentation of a synthetic peptide."

The percentage rank score indicates how strong a peptide\u2019s predicted binding affinity is compared to a large pool of naturally occurring peptides. A rank score of 10% indicates that a peptide is amongst the 10% strongest binding random natural peptides for HLA-A*02:01. Peptides with predicted rank scores &lt;=10% were classified as binders, all other peptides were considered non-binders. All non-binders were screened for potential nested HLA-A*02:01 binders by predicting the binding affinity of all overlapping 8\u201311mers within the eluted peptide sequence. A more conservative rank score &lt;=2% was used to identify nested binders. If multiple nested binders were identified within the same eluted peptide, the nested binder with the strongest predicted binding affinity was selected. Permuted peptides were generated by scrambling the amino acid sequence of the eluted peptide and predictions were preformed in the same manner."

To address this point we have now performed thermostability assays on the two extended peptides YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR and FVLELEPEWTVK. We also completed a thermostability analysis with their respective binding cores. We find that the two extended ligand complexes are quite stable, having melting temperatures consistent with other reported HLA-A2 ligand complexes. Moreover, the core peptides, although they were never found to be presented, were considerably more stable, with a Tm of at least 10\u02daC above their extended counterpart. Thus, the extended ligands are stable in solution as compared to canonical as well as bulging peptide ligands while the core alone substantially increases the stability of the complex. In retrospect, it is likely that a highly stable core is key to the stability of the extended ligand. These data have been added as a new paragraph in the Results section of the manuscript along with <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> that depicts these data."

                    "text": "The reviewers raise a question that we now address in the revised manuscript. While it is possible that the extended peptides are an artifact associated with the secreted HLA protein, there are previous studies demonstrating that secreted HLA proteins are not significantly altered in their trafficking or in their peptide repertoires (Skull et al 2012). Specifically, a study comparing secreted HLA-A*02:01 and membrane-bound HLA-A*02:01 shows that the secreted HLA traffics and matures in the same manner as membrane-bound HLA, albeit at different rates. Furthermore, there is little to no difference in the ligand repertoires of secreted and membrane-bound HLA (Skull et al 2012). In regards to the presentation of longer ligands, these data have been quietly emerging for some time, yet nobody has characterized them to the extent we have here. One analysis of ligands eluted from membrane-bound HLA ligands shows the presence of extended ligands, although the frequency of extended ligands was not addressed (Skull et al 2012, Chen et al 1994, and Hassan et al 2015). Reports of ligand extension in mouse MHC class I provide further evidence of extended ligands (Horig et al 1999). Simply put, membrane preparations of HLA provide relatively small quantities of eluted ligand for characterization. Furthermore, extended peptides remain hidden in membrane preparations of HLA because ligands from 3-6 HLA are usually characterized simultaneously such that it is difficult to assign a binding core and HLA restriction to the extended ligands and are often left out of the analysis. Secretion provides a single HLA so that extended ligands can clearly be assigned to their restricting class I molecule. Finally, the ligands discovered in secreted HLA have successfully been developed into viral vaccines and human melanoma vaccines (1, 2), demonstrating the biological relevance of the secreted HLA model. In summary, there is a considerable body of data supporting the use of secreted HLA to more fully appreciate ligand repertoires. Secreted HLA reflects membrane-bound HLA as demonstrated in both biochemical and clinical studies, and secreted HLA provides perhaps the only approach to clearly assign extended ligands to their corresponding HLA. We nonetheless included, in the revised manuscript, a Discussion statement suggesting that future studies using very large scale in vivomembrane-bound HLA will more definitively demonstrate these data."
