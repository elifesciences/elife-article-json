CarD, an essential activator in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, is found in many bacteria, including <i>Thermus</i> species, but absent in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. To delineate the molecular mechanism of CarD, we determined crystal structures of <i>Thermus</i> transcription initiation complexes containing CarD. The structures show CarD interacts with the unique DNA topology presented by the upstream double-stranded/single-stranded DNA junction of the transcription bubble. We confirm that our structures correspond to functional activation complexes, and extend our understanding of the role of a conserved CarD Trp residue that serves as a minor groove wedge, preventing collapse of the transcription bubble to stabilize the transcription initiation complex. Unlike <i>E. coli</i> RNAP, many bacterial RNAPs form unstable promoter complexes, explaining the need for CarD."

CarD, an essential activator in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, is found in many bacteria, including <i>Thermus</i> species, but absent in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. To delineate the molecular mechanism of CarD, we determined crystal structures of <i>Thermus</i> transcription initiation complexes containing CarD. The structures show CarD interacts with the unique DNA topology presented by the upstream double-stranded/single-stranded DNA junction of the transcription bubble. We confirm that our structures correspond to functional activation complexes, and extend our understanding of the role of a conserved CarD Trp residue that serves as a minor groove wedge, preventing collapse of the transcription bubble to stabilize the transcription initiation complex. Unlike <i>E. coli</i> RNAP, many bacterial RNAPs form unstable promoter complexes, explaining the need for CarD."

The structures show that one part of CarD interacts with the DNA at the start of the transcription bubble, and another part binds to the RNA polymerase. CarD fits between the two strands of DNA in the promoter, like a wedge, to keep the strands apart. Therefore, CarD stabilizes the open promoter complex and prevents the transcription bubble from collapsing."

Unique among known transcription activators, the CarD-RID interacts with the RNAP \u03b2 subunit \u03b21-lobe (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stallings et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Weiss et al., 2012</a>) (corresponding to the eukaryotic RNAP II Rpb2 protrusion domain; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cramer et al., 2001</a>), which is near the upstream portion of the transcription bubble in RPo (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2015</a>). The disposition of the CarD-CTD with respect to the CarD-RID is widely divergent in <i>Tth</i> and <i>Mtb</i> CarD crystal structures, leading to conflicting models for the CarD activation mechanism (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gulten and Sacchettini, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Srivastava et al., 2013</a>). To resolve these ambiguities, we determined crystal structures of <i>Thermus aquaticus</i> (<i>Taq</i>) transcription initiation complexes (RPo) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2015</a>) containing CarD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The structures show that CarD interacts with the unique DNA topology of the upstream double-stranded/single-stranded (ds/ss) DNA junction of the transcription bubble. Additional biochemical data confirm that our structures correspond to functional activation complexes, and extend our understanding of the role of a universally conserved CarD Trp residue in stabilizing the unwound transcription bubble, thereby stabilizing the transcription initiation complex."

The full con promoter sequence, derived by in vitro evolution, is likely to be optimized for binding to E\u03c3<sup>A</sup>. We use this sequence only for structural studies where high-affinity, homogeneous complexes are critical for crystallization. AP3 is a native <i>Mtb</i> rRNA promoter and its regulation by <i>Mtb</i> CarD has been well characterized (<a href=\"#bib44\">Srivastava et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Davis et al., 2015</a>). In order to biochemically characterize more than one promoter, we also studied 23S, a native <i>Tth</i> rRNA promoter. In promoter-based assays, the effects of <i>Tth</i> or <i>Mtb</i> CarD on each promoter were qualitatively the same. In general, we present the results from <i>Tth</i> 23S since most of the studies used <i>Thermus</i> E\u03c3<sup>A</sup> and CarD. In some cases, it was advantageous to use <i>Mtb</i> AP3 instead and we note the rationales below."

Analysis of the diffraction data indicated high occupancy of one CarD molecule bound to each of two RNAP/promoter complexes in the asymmetric unit of the crystal lattice (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Docking CarD onto the RNAP was facilitated by a high-resolution crystal structure of a <i>Tth</i> CarD/<i>Taq</i> \u03b21-lobe complex (2.4 \u00c5-resolution, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

The protein/protein and protein/nucleic acid interactions were essentially identical among all of the four crystallographically independent complexes, so the more complete and higher resolution CarD/RPo structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) is described here. Although the CarD bound to one RPo in the crystallographic asymmetric unit made crystal-packing interactions with a symmetry-related CarD, the CarD bound to the second RPo did not participate in any crystal-packing interactions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating the architecture and interactions observed here are unlikely to be influenced by crystal packing interactions and likely represent the functional activation complex in solution."

The \u221212 T/A base pair is a conserved part of the promoter \u221210 element (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shultzaberger et al., 2007</a>), and, as expected, transcription activity from each of the mutant promoters was reduced at least threefold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moyle et al., 1991</a>).

In the <i>Mtb</i> structure, the CarD-CTD is rotated \u223c140\u00b0 relative to the CarD-RID (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Structural modeling in the context of RPo positions the <i>Mtb</i> CarD-CTD and the functionally important W85 away from the promoter DNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). To determine the functional conformation of CarD, we introduced a disulfide to lock the conformation of <i>Mtb</i> CarD into the one observed in the <i>Tth</i> CarD structures. In the seven crystallographically independent copies of <i>Tth</i> CarD (PDB IDs 4L5G and structures reported here) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Srivastava et al., 2013</a>), the average distance between the \u03b1-carbons of CarD-RID-P13 and CarD-CTD-G100 is 5.7 \u00b1 0.8 \u00c5, and among the four copies determined in the presence of promoter DNA, an even tighter distribution is observed, 5.2 \u00b1 0.1 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <i>right</i>). On the other hand, the corresponding positions in the <i>Mtb</i> CarD structure (P12/G99) are 24 \u00c5 apart (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <i>left</i>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gulten and Sacchettini, 2013</a>). Cys substitions at these positions are predicted to form a disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions in the <i>Tth</i> CarD conformation (thus locking the domain orientation), but not the <i>Mtb</i> CarD conformation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We engineered the P12/G99 Cys substitutions in <i>Mtb</i> CarD (<i>Mtb</i> CarD2C; wild-type <i>Mtb</i> CarD is devoid of Cys residues). Non-reducing SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry confirmed that under oxidizing conditions, the CarD-RID and CarD-CTD were disulfide crosslinked in greater than 98% of CarD2C, while under reducing conditions, no disulfide bond was present in &gt;99% of CarD2C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We tested the function of oxidized (crosslinked) and reduced CarD2C using a mycobacterial transcription system (<a href=\"#bib44\">Srivastava et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Davis et al., 2015</a>) on the <i>Mtb</i> AP3 promoter. Under oxidizing conditions, the cross-linked, conformationally locked CarD2C activated transcription as well as wild type CarD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, 0 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The observation that under reducing conditions, CarD2C was somewhat impaired in transcription activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4D, 5</a> mM DTT) is explained by the fact that the CarD positions corresponding to <i>Mtb</i> CarD P13 and G99 are conserved (<a href=\"#bib44\">Srivastava et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Source code 1</a>); on this basis substitution of these positions would be expected to impair uncrosslinked CarD2C function. We conclude that the <i>Tth</i> CarD structures, with CarD-CTD W86 positioned to interact with the upstream edge of the transcription bubble (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), represents the functional conformation of CarD."

In the absence of a structure of a mycobacterial transcription initiation complex, we present here the structure of <i>Tth</i> CarD with a <i>Taq</i> transcription initiaton complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The structural results, combined with supporting biochemical studies, establish that the CarD-RID makes a protein/protein interaction with the RNAP \u03b21-lobe, thereby positioning the CarD-CTD and a conserved Trp residue to interact with the upstream edge of the transcription bubble, using a wedge mechanism to prevent collapse of the transcription bubble (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C, 2B</a>). This is a previously unseen mechanism of activation by a transcription factor. Specifically: (1) CarD does not induce any major changes on the holoenzyme nor the transcription bubble (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>); (2) CarD contacts with the DNA are mostly confined to the backbone phosphates, with the exception of the conserved Trp (W86) that serves as a wedge at the upstream edge of the bubble, which may be stabilized by a hydrogen bond with the conserved T<sub>\u221212</sub>(t) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We show that this W-wedge residue and its interaction with T<sub>\u221212</sub>(t) is important for full CarD function (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>); (3) We show that <i>Tth</i> CarD functions similarly to <i>Mtb</i> CarD to increase the lifetime of RPo by preventing collapse of the transcription bubble (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>); (4) We show that the mode of CarD interaction with RNAP and with the promoter DNA revealed by our structures represents the functionally relevant conformation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), resolving conflicting models."

Moreover, CarD is a global regulator, found at most \u03c3<sup>A</sup> promoters throughout the <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> genome (<a href=\"#bib44\">Srivastava et al., 2013</a>), and is essential in the two mycobacterial species where it has been tested (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stallings et al., 2009</a>). These observations suggest that CarD boosts transcription at most (if not all) promoters by acting as a basal transcription factor, required to compensate for otherwise rapidly dissociating RNAP/promoter complexes. While the interaction with T<sub>\u221212</sub>(t) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) may modulate the effect of CarD in a promoter-specific manner, this is likely to be a minor effect in vivo since T<sub>\u221212</sub>(t) is present at most \u03c3<sup>A</sup> promoters (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shultzaberger et al., 2007</a>), and CarD can nevertheless activate transcription from promoters that lack a \u221212 T/A base pair (although less effectively; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

The CarD-RID/RNAP \u03b21-lobe protein/protein interaction positions the CarD-CTD to interact with the upstream edge of the transcription bubble in a functionally relevant pose that does not allosterically alter the structure of the transcription bubble nor RNAP holoenzyme/promoter interactions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>); instead CarD supports pre-existing RNAP holoenzyme/promoter DNA interactions in RPo. The mode of CarD/DNA interaction is incompatible with duplex B-form DNA; the normal minor groove is too narrow to accommodate the end of CarD-\u03b13 and CarD-W86 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Srivastava et al., 2013</a>). This is consistent with a kinetic analysis of CarD function that concluded CarD stabilizes RPo by increasing the rate of isomerization to RPo and decreasing the rate of bubble collapse, but has little effect on the formation of the closed RNAP/promoter complex (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rammohan et al., 2015</a>)."

The minor groove W-wedge increases the lifetime of RPo by preventing transcription bubble collapse (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). While we believe this is the dominant mode of action for CarD, CarD may affect other steps of the initiation process as well.

At this point, the model fit well to the electron density but the <i>R</i><sub>free</sub> and <i>R</i> factors remained relatively high (&gt;0.3). Twinning was identified by Xtriage in PHENIX (twinning operators \u2212k, \u2212h, \u2212l; twinning fraction 0.42). The final model was obtained after twinning refinement using PHENIX."

Briefly, reactions were performed in transcription buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM DTT, 50 \u03bcg/ml BSA) with 100 mM NaCl for the AP3 promoter or 100 mM K-glutamate for the 23S promoter, at 65\u00b0C. Core RNAP (200 nM) and \u03c3<sup>A</sup> (1 \u03bcM) were combined and incubated at 65\u00b0C for 5 min to form holoenzyme. CarD (2 \u03bcM, when used) was then added to the holoenzyme and incubated for an additional 5 min. Next, promoter DNA (10 nM) was added and RPo was allowed to form for 15 min at 65\u00b0C. Abortive transcription was initiated by the addition of an NTP mix containing the initiating dinucleotide (250 \u03bcM, GpU for AP3, UpG for 23S; TriLINK), the next NTP (\u03b1-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled, UTP for AP3, CTP for 23S; 1.25 \u03bcCi, with 50 \u03bcM of the same unlabeled NTP) and 2 \u03bcM of FC-bubble competitor DNA when used (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davis et al., 2015</a>). After 10 min, transcription was quenched and analyzed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davis et al., 2015</a>). For half-life assays, competitor was first added and NTP substrates were added at different times as indicated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5B,C, 6B</a>)."

Tandem Q-sepharose column chromatography (GE Healthcare) was used to remove inter-molecular cross-linked CarD. Sample was first applied on a 5 ml column and eluted using a NaCl gradient from 200 mM to 1 M over 20 column volumes (cv). The purest fractions were combined and reapplied to a second 5 ml Q column and eluted using a NaCl gradient from 100 mM to 1 M over 40 cv. This purification yielded &gt;95% intra-molecular cross-linked CarD as verified by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and liquid chromatography-mass spectromety-MS analysis (The Rockefeller University Proteomics Resource Center).

A hinge between the CTD and the domain that binds the \u03b21-lobe allows the former to dock into the fork. Various biochemical measurements support the interpretation that CarD increases the RPo lifetime. This work rationalizes divergent structures in the literature: by using disulfide bond formation they validate that <i>Tth</i> CarD structure in the open complex reported here, accurately reflects that of the active form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis CarD. The authors further validate the structure by showing that: (a) KMnO<sub>4</sub> footprinting indicates that DNA structure is unchanged but that the open complex is more stable, (b) CarD has no stimulatory effect on the open bubble construct and (c) the T is preferred at the -12 non-template position, over any other base as surmised from suggested contact between the crucial W86 residue. The authors also explore the effects of substituting other aromatics or branched chain amino acids at the C\u03b1 position. That some of this characterization has already been performed with the mycobacterial enzyme provides evidence for the generality of the mode of action of CarD."

The authors make use of the 23S and the AP3 promoter for their biochemical assays, but do not provide any biochemical data for the full con promoter that was used for the structural studies.

We use this sequence for many of our structural studies to achieve high-affinity, homogeneous complexes important for crystallization. The promoter is extremely active in abortive initiation assays but is actually a poor promoter in vitro and in vivo in run-off assays since there is an issue with promoter escape (RNAP is bound too tightly to the promoter). Because of these properties, the promoter is unlikely to be regulated (it\u2019s already as active as it can be in abortive initiation) and we generally don\u2019t use it for transcription assays, etc."
