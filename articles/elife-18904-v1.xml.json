PMS is a relatively common monogenic and highly penetrant cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), and frequently presents with attention deficits. The underlying neurobiology of PMS is not fully known and pharmacological treatments for core symptoms do not exist. Here, we report the production and characterization of a <i>Shank3</i>-deficient rat model of PMS, with a genetic alteration similar to a human SHANK3 mutation. We show that <i>Shank3</i>-deficient rats exhibit impaired long-term social recognition memory and attention, and reduced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex pathway. These deficits were attenuated with oxytocin treatment. The effect of oxytocin on reversing non-social attention deficits is a particularly novel finding, and the results implicate an oxytocinergic contribution in this genetically defined subtype of ASD and ID, suggesting an individualized therapeutic approach for PMS."

PMS is a relatively common monogenic and highly penetrant cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), and frequently presents with attention deficits. The underlying neurobiology of PMS is not fully known and pharmacological treatments for core symptoms do not exist. Here, we report the production and characterization of a <i>Shank3</i>-deficient rat model of PMS, with a genetic alteration similar to a human SHANK3 mutation. We show that <i>Shank3</i>-deficient rats exhibit impaired long-term social recognition memory and attention, and reduced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex pathway. These deficits were attenuated with oxytocin treatment. The effect of oxytocin on reversing non-social attention deficits is a particularly novel finding, and the results implicate an oxytocinergic contribution in this genetically defined subtype of ASD and ID, suggesting an individualized therapeutic approach for PMS."

Harony-Nicolas et al. genetically modified rats to carry changes in the SHANK3 gene that reflect those found in people with Phelan-McDermid syndrome. The rats had disabilities related to those seen in Phelan-McDermid syndrome, including limits in long-term social memory and reduced attention span. They also showed changes in the connections between important parts of the brain. Therefore, studying these rats could help us to understand the link between molecular and cellular changes in the brain and how they affect people with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, and associated symptoms."

The neurobehavioral manifestations of PMS are caused by heterozygous mutations/deletions in the <i>SHANK3</i> gene leading to a reduced expression of the SHANK3 protein. Shank3 is a key structural component of the glutamatergic postsynaptic density (PSD), and interacts with glutamate receptors and cytoskeletal elements to regulate glutamate signaling and synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kreienkamp, 2008</a>). It has been estimated that more than 80% of individuals with PMS meet ASD diagnostic criteria and that\u00a0~0.5\u20131% of ASD cases, 1\u20132% of ID cases, and up to 2% of cases with both ASD and ID harbor a <i>SHANK3</i> mutation, which makes it one of the more common single locus causes of ASD and ID (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gong et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Soorya et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Leblond et al., 2014</a>). Despite its prevalence, PMS is less well studied than other single locus genetic disorders such as Fragile X or Rett syndromes. To date, no pharmaceutical compounds targeting core symptoms of PMS are available. To address this lack of effective therapeutics, several mouse lines with distinct <i>Shank3</i> gene mutations have been developed to help understand the neurobiology of the syndrome and as a means of ultimately developing and assessing potential therapeutics (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bozdagi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pe\u00e7a et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kouser et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kloth et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bidinosti et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Mei et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). The various <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mouse models have displayed PMS and ASD-related behavioral phenotypes including impaired social behavior, increased repetitive behaviors, and motor deficits, as well as altered synaptic transmission and neuronal morphology in the brain (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bozdagi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pe\u00e7a et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kouser et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Drapeau et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). Recently, the translational relevance of these mouse models has been highlighted by our observation that the hormone IGF-1 improves motor and synaptic deficits observed in a <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mouse line (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bozdagi et al., 2013</a>), a result which directly led to a safety and preliminary efficacy clinical trial of IGF-1 in children with PMS (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kolevzon, 2014a</a>)."

This domain was targeted because five patients had been described with mutations in it (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Durand et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Moessner et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib26\">Hamdan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boccuto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Yuen et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, the predicted truncated protein generated upon ZFN targeting of the rat <i>Shank3</i> gene is quite similar to one of the human mutations that have been described (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hamdan et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, middle sequence). In rat, this mutation leads to a significant reduction in the number of <i>Shank3</i> transcripts (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and reduces expression levels of the full-length Shank3a protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We also observed that the levels of the PSD scaffolding protein Homer1 are decreased in the <i>Shank3</i>-deficient rats (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), consistent with changes in the PSD and with well-replicated findings from <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mice.

To assess short-term SRM, the SD test was performed 30 min after the subject encountered the familiar rat for 5 min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), while, in the more challenging long-term SRM, which requires longer exposure to the social stimulus (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gur et al., 2014</a>), the same test was performed 24 hr after a 1 hr encounter with the familiar rats (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

This task requires training the rats in stages where the duration of the light stimulus is slowly decreased from 32 to 1 s by halving the stimulus duration across sessions once performance criteria are met (i.e. accuracy rates higher than 80% for two consecutive days with omission rates lower than 20%). <i>Shank3-</i>Het and KO rats learned the task and were able to reach baseline, similar to WT controls. However, both the <i>Shank3</i> Het and KO rats had lower accuracy and lower omission rates, when compared to WT rats, even after extensive training. Moreover, after reaching baseline criterion <i>Shank3</i>-deficient rats did not maintain even this level of performance across the 10-day test period, during which they performed significantly fewer correct trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), made more errors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), and exhibited higher omission rates than WT rats (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

It was only when the duration of the light cues was shortened that the deficits were manifested, which indicates impaired vigilance and/or spatial attention. Furthermore, these deficits were not due to decreased motivation for food, because the latency of <i>Shank3</i>-deficient rats to collect reward after a correct response was similar to WT rats (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), as was task performance when light cues were of a longer duration (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

The behavioral deficits we observe in <i>Shank3</i>-deficient rats are consistent with dysfunction in these circuits. The hippocampus and mPFC are both important for SRM (<a href=\"#bib71\">Watson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Harvey and Lepage, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jacobs and Tsien, 2014</a>).

We therefore evaluated the effect of <i>Shank3</i> deficiency on synaptic function and plasticity in hippocampal-PFC circuitry. Extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fESPs) recordings at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses were similar between genotypes, with no differences in paired-pulse facilitation (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) or the input-output relationship (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We therefore assessed hippocampal-PFC synaptic transmission in vivo by stimulating hippocampal CA1/subicular regions and recording fEPSPs in the prelimbic area of the PFC in anesthetized rats. We found that LTP was reduced in both <i>Shank3</i>-Het and KO rats (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We also observed that there were no genotype associated differences in the input-output relationship of evoked local field potentials in coronal PFC slices, which demonstrates that these changes were specific to hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). In summary, these results suggest that <i>Shank3-</i>deficiency impairs plasticity in both the projections from hippocampus to the PFC and within intrinsic hippocampal circuits."

In our genetically modified rat model of PMS, we found that <i>Shank</i>3 deficiency impairs social memory and attention. These impairments are accompanied by attenuated synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus and in the monosynaptic pathway connecting the hippocampus to the PFC. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits have also\u00a0been reported in <i>Shank3</i>-mouse models and were associated with impairments in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and with changes in the levels of glutamatergic receptors and other PSD scaffolding components including Homer, which we also found to be decreased in the <i>Shank3</i>-deficient rat (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bozdagi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Duffney et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kouser et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). The fact that long-term social memory was selectively impaired, in contrast to more general memory processes, may reflect the complexity of the information involved in social memory (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adolphs, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wiley, 2013</a>), which may require more elaborate synaptic mechanisms than simpler forms of memory. These results may also relate to previous findings that correlate ASD-associated episodic memory deficits with the complexity of the memoranda (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lind, 2010</a>), which suggests that sub-optimal thresholds for synaptic plasticity interfere with the ability of complex stimuli, such as social stimuli, to activate memory formation. Deficits in attentionally demanding tasks, like the 5-CSRT task, may also result from blunted synaptic plasticity, where brief events must be rapidly encoded and reliably stored by neural circuits to promote appropriate and timely behavior."

A recent study of functional neuroimaging showed that differential fMRI changes in response to social versus non-social sounds are preserved in PMS, in contrast to studies of idiopathic autism (iASD) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). These findings, together with the fact that not all individuals with PMS are diagnosed with ASD, indicate that animal models for PMS should not necessarily present with social behavioral deficits and imply that behavioral phenotypic diversity in PMS patients may reflect additional processes."

Beyond these methodological issues, from an evolutionary perspective, mice and rats are separated by millions of years, which likely explain many of the observed discrepancies in behavioral repertoires between the two species.

Although all the mutations that have been studied, including the one we introduced to the rat model, lead to the deletion of the longest <i>Shank3</i> isoform, most leave intact other shorter isoforms, whose role is still unclear. Because many patients lack the entire <i>SHANK3</i> gene, understanding the role of different Shank3 isoforms is of great interest, and contrasting existing rodent models will be useful in clarifying this important question."

Oxytocin has been also studied in clinical trials as a potential therapeutic for iASD-associated social impairments, yet these efforts have led to equivocal results (<a href=\"#bib24\">Guastella et al., 2016</a>). Hitherto, the effect of oxytocin has not been investigated in PMS or in animal models of PMS, and its effect on non-social ASD and PMS-associated deficits has not been evaluated. Given the evidence for a key role for oxytocin in SRM, we tested this compound and observed important effects on both behavioral and electrophysiological\u00a0deficits.

The ameliorative effect of oxytocin treatment on the long-term social memory, attention and synaptic plasticity deficits in <i>Shank3</i>-deficient rats, support a mechanism whereby deficits in synaptic plasticity across hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry may underly the behavioral deficits we observed.

They have several species-specific advantages over mouse models, including a more complex behavioral repertoire and larger brains that readily facilitate high-density electrophysiological recordings. Moreover, rats remain the primary choice of the pharmaceutical industry for studying the pharmacokinetic properties of novel drugs that may have therapeutic potential in human. Our production of a <i>Shank3</i>-deficient rat model, which demonstrates both construct and face validity, will pave the way for future studies that investigate the mode by which <i>Shank3</i> mutations alter brain activity during behavior and to further study the effects of oxytocin and other potential therapeutics for PMS. Our findings open new avenues of research to study the effect of <i>Shank3</i>-deficiency on the development and function of oxytocin neurons. Future studies should investigate if <i>Shank3</i>-deficiency affects hypothalamic processes that regulate oxytocin production and secretion (<a href=\"#bib13\">Brownstein et al., 1980</a>) or whether it perturbs pathways further\u00a0downstream. Additionally, it would be important to determine if oxytocin treatments during critical developmental windows could ameliorate PMS-associated behavioral deficits, and whether other forms of ASD, defined either etiologically or by the presence of specific biomarkers, may show such broad response to oxytocin. These, and other experiments, would support the use of oxytocinergic agonists for multiple forms of ASD, including additional genetically defined forms of ASD."

Two of the arms (50 \u00d7 10.8 cm) have high walls (15.75 cm) on all sides except the central entry area (\u2018closed arms\u2019), and the other two arms have no walls (\u2018open arms\u2019). All surfaces visible to the experimental subjects are made of black acrylic. The whole apparatus is elevated approximately 85 cm above the floor and is surrounded by black vinyl curtains. Appropriate padding was placed underneath the EPM apparatus in the rare event that an animal fell when in the open arms of the maze. On test days, rats were habituated to the experimental room at least 1 hr prior to being exposed to the EPM. After this habituation period, the animals were placed in the center area of the EPM apparatus facing an open arm and allowed to freely explore for 5 min. We measured total distance traveled, time spent in and number of entries into both the open and closed arms of the EPM (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> for a summary of these results).

Briefly, after weaning at 21 days of age, rats were pair-housed. Prior to the juvenile social play test each rat was individually habituated to the test cage for 10 min for three consecutive days. After this third habituation session, rats were socially isolated for 24 hr before the juvenile social play test began. On test days, two non-littermate rats, of the same gender, were placed into the 45\u00d745\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040 cm test arena for 10 min. The play partner was always a WT rat with no more than 10 g difference in body weight when compared to the test subject. The behavior of the animals was videotaped and analyzed post hoc using video tracking software (Ethovision XT, Noldus). Several aspects of social play were assessed, including approaching, chasing, crawling, nape attacking, pinning, and boxing of the conspecific rat. Other forms of social, but non-play behaviors, were also measured such as licking, grooming, and body or anogenital sniffing of the play partner. Approaching was included in both play and non-play social behaviors as it cannot be considered solely as part of the play sequelae. Behaviors were scored independently by two trained observers who were blind to the test animal\u2019s genotype (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

Briefly, rats were trained to touch the location of an illuminated white square that is presented at 1 of 5 locations on a Bussey-Saksida capacitive touchscreen system (Lafayette Instrument Company; Lafayette, IN, USA). If a capacitive screen touch occurred at the illuminated location during or up to 1 s after stimulus presentation a sugar pellet was delivered in the reward receptacle located across the chamber from the touch screen. Training occurred in stages where the duration of the light stimulus was slowly decreased from 32 to 1 s by halving the stimulus duration across sessions once criterion performance was met (~80% accuracy and less than 20% of trials omitted). 4 WT, 5 Het, and 3 KO rats were unable to reach performance criterion at 1 s and therefore were excluded from analysis of 5-CSRT task\u00a0performances.

The brain was removed and quickly placed in ice-cold cutting solution containing the following (in mM): 215 sucrose, 20 glucose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.6 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2.5 KCl. Hippocampi were mounted on an agar block, and transverse slices 400 \u03bcm thick were prepared with a DTK-2000 microslicer (Dosaka EM). Slices were placed in a hot water bath at 30\u00b0C, in a holding chamber containing 50% cutting solution and 50% artificial CSF (ACSF) recording solution, which contained the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>. After 30 min, the 1:1 solution was switched to ACSF at 30\u00b0C and the holding chamber was removed from the water bath. Slices recovered in ACSF at room temperature for at least 1 hr, and then were transferred to a submersion-type, temperature-controlled recording chamber (TC-344B, Warner Instruments) and perfused with ACSF at 2 ml/min using a peristaltic pump (Dynamax RP-1, Rainin). Experiments were performed at 28\u00b0C. All solutions were equilibrated for at least 30 min with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4. Conventional field recordings were performed using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). For field experiments, a recording electrode fabricated on a two-step micropipette puller (PP-830 or PC-10, Narishige) filled with a solution containing 5 M NaCl. This electrode was placed \u223c150 \u03bcm deep in the stratum radiatum. To elicit synaptic responses, paired, monopolar square-wave voltage or current pulses (100\u2013200 \u00b5s pulse width) were delivered through a stimulus isolator (Isoflex, AMPI) connected to a broken tip (\u223c20\u201340 \u03bcm) stimulating patch-type micropipette filled with ACSF. In some experiments, a bipolar stimulating electrode was used. As both stimulations produced comparable results, the results were averaged together in the final analysis. Typically, stimulating electrodes were placed in the middle of CA1 stratum radiatum. Stimulus intensity was adjusted to give comparable magnitude synaptic responses across experiments (\u223c1 mV for extracellular field recordings). Baseline stimulation was delivered at 0.1 Hz, before and after the induction of long-term plasticity. All neurophysiological data were acquired and analyzed blind to genotype."

For the 5-CSRT task, surgery occurred after baseline performance was measured for 10 sessions (after criterion performance was first met on with a 1 s cue duration). For surgery, rats were deeply anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 10% ketamine (0.09 ml/100 g) and Dormitor (0.05 ml/100 g) or with isoflurane. Anesthetized animals were fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus with the head flat, and a small hole was drilled in the skull to facilitate implantation of guide cannula. The cannula was inserted 0.1 mm (SRM task) or 1.25 mm (5-CSRT\u00a0task) above the left lateral ventricle. The coordinates were AP = \u22121 mm, ML\u00a0=\u00a01.5 mm, DV\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.6 mm (SRM experiments) or AP\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.75 mm, ML\u00a0=\u00a01.75 mm, DV = \u22124 mm (5-CSRT task) both targeting the left lateral ventricle. Cannula were secured in position with acrylic dental cement and stabilized by at least two bone screws. A dummy cannula was placed in the guide cannula to prevent the tube from clogging. Antibiotics (amoxicilin 15%, 0.07 ml/100 g) and a pain killer (Calmagin 0.03 ml/100 g) were administered directly before and immediately following surgery and one day post-surgery. Animals were allowed to recover for at least 7 days before experimentation began. Post-surgery, 5-CSRT\u00a0task rats were retrained to stable performance before being subjected to microinjections. In the oxytocin 5-CSRT experiments, two implanted KOs, 1 Het and WT were not subjected to microinjections because they failed to achive pre-surgery performance levels. In the long-term SRM task, 1 WT and 2 KOs lost their caps, 1 Het and 1 KO died during surgery, and 1 Het was extremely stressed and thus was not subjected to oxytocin injection. All experiments were run and analyzed blind to genotype."

They report that these rats show several behavioral impairments related to social memory and attention that are associated with PMS, and then go on to show that electrophysiological phenotypes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are present in these rats that may serve as potential mechanisms for the observed behavioral deficits. These phenotypes were reversed by in vitro or in vivo administration of oxytocin. These novel findings are of high interest to the field as using rats as model organisms for ASD could be beneficial for translating potential treatment options. However, there is a disconnect between the presented findings and the authors' claims that these rats serve as an animal model of ASD \u2013 these rats do not show any of the core behavioral symptoms of ASD (repetitive behavior, social interaction deficits, etc.). The phenotypes are more related to learning and memory, which are affected in patients with <i>Shank3</i> mutations. Thus, the title and Abstract are misleading. Overall, a more transparent and accurate assessment of the Results is necessary, rather than trying to fit this model into the \"ASD box. \" In fact, it is quite interesting that these animals do not mirror the mouse models, and do not have behavioral manifestations expected in a model of ASD, but rather a model of ID."

The opposite is true. The <i>Shank3</i> HET and KO rats show intact short-term memory on the short-term social discrimination test even with a short exploration time, indicating that their social exploration or perception is not affected. And they show an impaired behavior on the long-term social discrimination test thus suggesting that their long-term memory is affected, even when given enough time (1 hour) for exploration. Furthermore, the possibility of differences in exploration is addressed by the similarity in total exploration time between the genotypes and in their social preference. We have now added and discussed these points in the Results section (subsection \u201cSocial memory and attentional deficits in <i>Shank3</i>-deficient rats\u201d, second paragraph)."

As an example is the low and high doses of LiCl used in the conditioned taste aversion paradigm (Houpt&amp;Berlin; 1999, PMID:<span class=\"underline\">10355522</span>). This, in fact, correlates with LTP procedures where short-term LTP can be achieved with one train of tetanic stimulation while long- term LTP requires several such trains. The idea behind using distinct procedures in our experiments is to apply a minimal exposure that generates a stable memory, so if indeed any of the genotypes exhibit impaired social memory it will be easily detected on the background of such a minimal procedure. For short-term memory, exposure of 5 minutes is enough, and hence used here, while a much longer exposure (1 h in our hands) is needed for long-term SRM (in rats)."

However, it is important to note that the pattern of deficit we observe, and which is evoked by only changing the stimulus duration, is commonly interpreted as reflecting an attentional deficit, while deficits observed by changing the physical qualities of the light(brightness or illuminance) are those that reflect perceptual differences (Reviewed by Robbins TW, 2002, PMID: 12373437). In our experiment we used the same light stimulus in all sessions and found that the rats have no problem in seeing and responding to the light, implying that they have no issues with their sensory perception. We also did a decreased brightness challenge in one of the rat cohorts and did not observe any effect on performance, which further argues against the observed primary deficit being due to perceptual problems. Only when the duration of the light was shortened, the deficits were evoked and the rats had difficulties in detecting a more briefly presented light, indicating that the <i>Shank3</i> Het and KO rats have difficulty in vigilance or spatial attention.

Instead, the aim was to examine whether the observed deficits in social recognition memory are specific to social stimuli or that the <i>Shank3</i> rats have a general memory deficit. Obviously, the first choice one would think about to test non- social memory is the novel object recognition test, given the fact that it technicallyseems to be the best to parallel the social discrimination test that we applied. However, the reason we focused on the object location memory and contextual fear conditioning tests in our study is because social recognition memory is well known to be hippocampal- dependent and our findings demonstrate that the <i>Shank3</i> rat model has hippocampal LTP deficits. Therefore, we aimed to examine other hippocampal-dependent memory paradigms. Both the object location and the fear conditioning tests are known to be hippocampal dependent, while the dependence of the object location memory test on the hippocampus is not clear (see for example Gaskin et al. 2003, PMID: 14750658). Since the object location memory and the contextual fear conditioning tests differ in their mode (the fear-conditioning task is a reinforcement-driven task while the object location memory test depends on the animal\u2019s natural exploratory tendency when introduced in a new stimulus or stimulating environment), we decided to include both.

In general, our N for behavioral studies ranged between 9-22, therefore we were 60-80% powered to detect large effect differences (\u03b4=1 \u2013 1.5). As noted, we also calculated the numbers for each experiment based on its design using the \u201cbiomath\u201d online tool. For example, for the social discrimination test, we applied a paired t-test between the novel and familiar stimuli to determine SRM (this was also applied for the Oxt treatment experiments). Since in normal conditions rats spend on average at least 60% of their total investigation time exploring the novel stimulus, with SD of 12%, a sample size of n=6 is calculated for 80% power and confidence interval of 5%. However, we always try to double this sample size so we aim for 12 animals per group, beyond the predicted sample size. This was important because, in some cases, we lost some animals during the experiment, leaving us with 7-8 animals, which is still beyond the predicted sample size.

Therefore, for each WT and KO rats we have two HET littermates that we could use and include in our data, when available, without invalidating our experiment and analysis. The 5-CSRTT requires at least two months of training after which we do surgeries to inject the OXT (in the case of the 5-CSRTT-OXT experiment). During this period and the surgeries, there is always a chance of losing one or two animals, which cannot be replaced, together with its littermates, before 4 additional months (breeding, reaching the age of testing and then training). Therefore, we tried to include as many of the available rats as possible, given the limited number of testing chambers, even if this means that we will not start or end with precisely equal numbers of animals."

This reality implies that the delivery approach of oxytocin to the brain should be improved to allow better comparison between direct and indirect administrations in animal studies and to optimize treatment efficacy in human subjects.

For this reason, others and we conclude that PMS-associated ASD is <i>not</i> associated with a social indifference or social aversion, in contrast to the more typical conception of ASD. In addition, we conclude that the primary, and most significant and pervasive deficits in PMS are cognitive and attentional, rather than social. And there is little doubt that there will be many subtypes of autism with preserved social interest.

None of these tests showed a significant difference between genotypes. The fact that socialrecognition memory, which is well known to be hippocampal-dependent, was affected in the <i>Shank3</i> rat model, while two other non- socialhippocampal-dependent memories were not, suggests that (1) the memory deficits are social specific and (2) social recognition memory is a more \"frangible\" type of memory that implicates more complex cues as compared to the non-social memory tested by us. Therefore, when the hippocampal circuitry is even partially impaired, the social recognition memory may be more vulnerable and more affected than other types of memory. Another possibility is that the PFC impairment is the most severe in our study and that this region is needed only for social memory."

Having that explained, one can\u2019t conclude based on current available data as to which brain region is targeted and most benefited by the oxytocin administration. PFC would certainly be the more reasonable target of attention restoration by oxytocin, yet this has to be experimentally examined. As we stated for the first point, and as the reviewer implied, identifying the target receptor activated by oxytocin and the brain region targeted will help address this issue. In this regard, brain recording as well as imaging studies (e.g., fMRI) following oxytocin administrations can also be valuable tool to be considered. Yet as we noted above, while important and significant to the field, understanding the mechanisms by which oxytocin exerts its effect is, in our opinion, best left to an independent study."
