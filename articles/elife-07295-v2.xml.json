We identified &gt;1680 <i>Botrytis</i>-induced WRKY33 binding sites associated with 1576 <i>Arabidopsis</i> genes. Transcriptional profiling defined 318 functional direct target genes at 14 hr post inoculation. Comparative analyses revealed that WRKY33 possesses dual functionality acting either as a repressor or as an activator in a promoter-context dependent manner. We confirmed known WRKY33 targets involved in hormone signaling and phytoalexin biosynthesis, but also uncovered a novel negative role of abscisic acid (ABA) in resistance towards <i>B. cinerea</i> 2100. The ABA biosynthesis genes <i>NCED3</i> and <i>NCED5</i> were identified as direct targets required for WRKY33-mediated resistance. Loss-of-WRKY33 function resulted in elevated ABA levels and genetic studies confirmed that WRKY33 acts upstream of <i>NCED3/NCED5</i> to negatively regulate ABA biosynthesis. This study provides the first detailed view of the genome-wide contribution of a specific plant transcription factor in modulating the transcriptional network associated with plant immunity."

We identified &gt;1680 <i>Botrytis</i>-induced WRKY33 binding sites associated with 1576 <i>Arabidopsis</i> genes. Transcriptional profiling defined 318 functional direct target genes at 14 hr post inoculation. Comparative analyses revealed that WRKY33 possesses dual functionality acting either as a repressor or as an activator in a promoter-context dependent manner. We confirmed known WRKY33 targets involved in hormone signaling and phytoalexin biosynthesis, but also uncovered a novel negative role of abscisic acid (ABA) in resistance towards <i>B. cinerea</i> 2100. The ABA biosynthesis genes <i>NCED3</i> and <i>NCED5</i> were identified as direct targets required for WRKY33-mediated resistance. Loss-of-WRKY33 function resulted in elevated ABA levels and genetic studies confirmed that WRKY33 acts upstream of <i>NCED3/NCED5</i> to negatively regulate ABA biosynthesis. This study provides the first detailed view of the genome-wide contribution of a specific plant transcription factor in modulating the transcriptional network associated with plant immunity."

Apart from the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana RESISTANCE TO LEPTOSPHAERIA MACULANS 3</i> (<i>RLM3</i>), no major <i>R-gene</i> has been associated with resistance to necrotrophs. However, over the past two decades numerous genes that influence the outcome of <i>B. cinerea</i>\u2014host interactions have been identified (<a href=\"#bib55\">Mengiste, 2012</a>). Among these are several transcription factors (TFs) consistent with the large transcriptional reprogramming observed in host cells upon <i>Botrytis</i> infection (<a href=\"#bib9\">Birkenbihl and Somssich, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Birkenbihl et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Windram et al., 2012</a>).

BOS1 (<i>BOTRYTIS SUSCEPTIBLE 1</i>)/MYB108 appears to restrict necrosis triggered by <i>B. cinerea</i> and <i>A. brassicicola</i>, and loss-of-BOS1 function increased plant susceptibility (<a href=\"#bib55\">Mengiste, 2012</a>). In response to stress and <i>B. cinerea</i> infection, BOS1 physically interacts with and is ubiquitinated by BOI, a RING E3 ligase that contributes to defense by restricting the extent of necrosis (<a href=\"#bib49\">Luo et al., 2010</a>). MYB51 is involved in the transcriptional activation of indole glucosinolate biosynthetic genes, which also contributes to resistance towards necrotrophs (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kliebenstein et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">S\u00e1nchez-Vallet et al., 2010</a>).

Moreover, WRKY33 directly interacted with its own promoter, suggesting a positive feedback regulatory loop on <i>WRKY33</i> expression. WRKY33 was also found to interact with the VQ-motif containing protein MAP KINASE SUBSTRATE1 (MKS1/VQ21) and to form a ternary complex with the MAP kinase MPK4 within the nucleus of resting cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andreasson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Qiu et al., 2008</a>). Upon challenge with the hemibiotrophic pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> or upon elicitation by the microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) flg22, the active epitope of the bacterial flagella, activated MPK4 phosphorylates MKS1 thereby releasing WRKY33 from the complex and leading to its detection at the <i>PAD3</i> promoter."

Compared to resistant wild-type (WT) plants, susceptible <i>wrky33</i> mutants displayed early inappropriate activation of salicylic acid (SA)-related host responses, elevated SA and JA levels, and down-regulation of JA-associated responses at later infection stages. Consistent with these results ChIP analysis demonstrated that WRKY33 directly binds to the regulatory regions of <i>JAZ1</i> and <i>JAZ5</i>, two genes encoding repressors of JA signaling, but also to the ERF class TF gene <i>ORA59</i> involved in JA-ET crosstalk, and to two camalexin biosynthesis genes <i>CYP71A13</i> and <i>PAD3</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Birkenbihl et al., 2012</a>). Although <i>pad3</i> plants are susceptible to <i>B. cinerea</i> 2100, <i>wrky33</i> mutants are more highly susceptible.

Expression of the majority of WRKY33 direct targets is down-regulated upon infection, but some notably genes of camalexin biosynthesis are strongly up-regulated, indicating that WRKY33 is a dual functional TF acting in a promoter-context dependent manner.

We performed electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) using recombinant WRKY33 protein to determine whether this newly identified DNA element is bound by WRKY33. Two DNA oligonucleotide probes were synthesized whose sequences were derived from two WRKY33 targets (<i>WAKL7, PROPEP3</i>) containing either one or three copies of the motif, respectively. A previously described DNA oligonucleotide containing three W-boxes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Mao et al., 2011</a>) and a W-box mutated version hereof W-boxmut served as positive and negative controls. A clear interaction (mobility shift) was observed between WRKY33 and the labeled W-box probe but not with W-boxmut and the two probes harboring the T/GTTGAAT motifs (M-3 and M-7; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Specificity of W-box binding was confirmed in competition experiments, wherein only an excess of the W-box probe was able to compete for binding of the protein.

However, it is important to note that nearly 18% of the WRKY33-induced targets were associated to defense responses compared to only 3% of the WRKY33-induced non-targets. This indicates that WRKY33 can also act as a direct activator of defense gene expression, very likely in a promoter-context dependent manner.

In the present work, combined genome-wide binding studies and transcriptional analyses allowed us to identify WRKY33 binding sites within the <i>Arabidopsis</i> genome upon fungal infection, and to correlate WRKY33 binding to altered transcriptional outputs.

Overall, 80% of the WRKY33 targets were not significantly differentially expressed in the <i>wrky33</i> mutant upon infection compared to WT. This excess number of gene loci bound by a given TF but unaffected in their expression is consistent with previous ChIP-seq studies although the reasons for this discrepancy remain to be elucidated (<a href=\"#bib52\">MacQuarrie et al., 2011</a>). One plausible explanation may be that transcriptional activation/repression at specific promoter sites is context dependent, and may require, apart from WRKY33 binding, additional diverse signaling inputs. For example, we detected strong enrichment of WRKY33 within the promoters of numerous genes coding for receptors of various MAMPs and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including <i>FLS2</i>, <i>EFR</i>, <i>CERK1, PEPR1</i>, and <i>PEPR2</i>, but no altered expression of these genes in the <i>wrky33</i> mutant upon <i>Botrytis</i> infection. <i>WRKY33</i> is also strongly and rapidly induced during MAMP/DAMP-triggered immunity (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lippok et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yamaguchi et al., 2010</a>), and thus a regulatory function of WRKY33 at these promoters may require additional signals/co-factors only triggered during MAMP/DAMP signaling. Additionally, spatial and temporal differences in the activation of target genes need to be considered. The current paper provides a snapshot of global WRKY33 function during <i>Botrytis</i> infection. Whether WRKY33 binding results in temporally distinct transcription patterns, as was observed for EIN3 in the ethylene response, remains to be investigated (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chang et al., 2013</a>). However, such studies employing living pathogens on intact host plants remain challenging due to the asynchrony of the infection process at various cellular sites within the tissue."

The ability of <i>Arabidopsis</i> to restrict penetration by the non-host barley pathogen <i>Blumeria graminis</i> was shown to be dependent on the NAC TF ATAF1-mediated repression of ABA biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jensen et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, overexpression of <i>ATAF1</i> resulted in enhanced susceptibility of <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants to <i>B. cinerea</i> (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). ATAF1 was shown to directly bind to the <i>NCED3</i> promoter, which positively correlated with increased <i>NCED3</i> expression and ABA levels (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jensen et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, transcriptomic studies using 4-week old detached <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaves infected with <i>B. cinerea</i> strain pepper revealed that genes involved in the suppression of ABA accumulation and signaling were up-regulated at early infection stages (<a href=\"#bib83\">Windram et al., 2012</a>). Our study clearly demonstrates that increased expression of WRKY33 target genes associated with ABA biosynthesis (<i>NCED3</i> and <i>NCED5</i>) is causal for the susceptibility of <i>wrky33</i> to <i>B. cinerea</i> 2100, and the ABA deficient <i>wrky33 nced3 nced5</i> mutant restored WT-like resistance towards this necrotroph. Hence, our findings reveal a novel role of WRKY33 in modulating host resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i> by suppressing ABA accumulation/signaling (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, resistance to the necrotrophic fungus <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</i> is also negatively impacted by ABA, and <i>wrky33-1</i> mutant plants exhibited an enhanced susceptible phenotype towards this pathogen (<a href=\"#bib74\">S\u00e1nchez-Vallet et al., 2012</a>).

It is conceivable that the increased ABA levels in <i>wrky33</i> during <i>Botrytis</i> infection trigger the activation of currently unidentified downstream ABA-response factors that bind to the ABA response elements (ABRE, ACGTGG/T) or G-boxes (CACGTG) present in some gene promoters, resulting in transcriptional activation.

Moreover, many human TFs function as repressors as often as they act as activators (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cusanovich et al., 2014</a>). In plants, few factors with dual functions have been unequivocally characterized. In tomato, the transcriptional activator Pti4 can repress the expression of <i>PR10-a</i> by forming a complex with the SEBP repressor (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gonzalez-Lamothe et al., 2008</a>). In <i>Arabidopsis,</i> the TF WUSCHEL acts mainly as a repressor in stem cell regulation, but can function as an activator of <i>AGAMOUS(AG)</i> during floral patterning (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ikeda et al., 2009</a>). Also WRKY proteins can act as activators or repressors, and selected family members in diverse plant species have been identified as key regulators in diverse plant processes (<a href=\"#bib72\">Rushton et al., 2010</a>). WRKY53 can activate or repress the expression of genes, depending on the nature of the target promoter sequence (<a href=\"#bib56\">Miao et al., 2004</a>). <i>WRKY6</i> activates <i>PR1</i> expression while suppressing the expression of its own gene, and that of its closely related family member <i>WRKY42</i> (<a href=\"#bib68\">Robatzek and Somssich, 2002</a>).

WRKY33 also directly or indirectly represses expression of other genes in different hormone signaling pathways as well as genes encoding WRKY, and NAC TFs. WRKY33 also positively affects resistance towards <i>B. cinerea</i> 2100 by directly targeting and inducing the expression of several genes involved in camalexin biosynthesis. In the <i>wrky33</i> mutant (lower panel), <i>B. cinerea</i> infection fails to activate host camalexin biosynthesis genes and increases ABA levels by up-regulation of <i>NCED3</i> and <i>NCED5</i>, which activates downstream ABA-dependent genes and ABA signaling. Among the ABA-dependent genes are genes involved in SA signaling, WRKY TFs, NAC TFs, and genes associated with auxin or JA conjugation indicating that ABA may act as a key sub-node in WRKY33-dependent host immunity to <i>B. cinerea</i>. Whereas WT-like resistance is restored in the <i>wrky33 nced3 nced5</i> triple mutant, all currently tested mutants of WRKY33-regulated genes acting downstream of ABA failed to restore resistance in the <i>wrky33</i> mutant background (marked by an asterisk). Thus, additional crucial genes causal for WRKY33-dependent resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i> 2100 remain to be discovered, as do ABA signaling components affecting <i>WRKY33</i> expression (indicated by the question marks).

The simplest hypothesis would be that WRKY33 is recruited to distinct repressor and activator complexes at defined promoter sites. For instance, several WRKY33-interacting proteins containing a VQ motif have been discovered that influence defense gene expression (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cheng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Pecher et al., 2014</a>). VQ proteins appear to act as suppressors of defense-related genes via their interaction with WRKY factors. Indeed, the protein VQ4/MVQ1 appears to function as a negative regulator of WRKY-type transcriptional activators including WRKY33. In a transient <i>Arabidopsis</i> protoplast assay, stimulation by MAMPs resulted in degradation of VQ4/MVQ1 following MAPK-mediated phosphorylation enabling WRKY33 to activate transcription of a defense-related reporter gene (<a href=\"#bib62\">Pecher et al., 2014</a>). Two other proteins, SIB1 and SIB2, have been reported to interact with WRKY33 via their VQ motifs. This interaction was required to stimulate WRKY33 DNA-binding activity and very likely to positively regulate WRKY33-mediated resistance to necrotrophic fungi (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lai et al., 2011</a>)."

VQ22/JAV1 functions as a negative regulator of JA-mediated defenses, and transgenic VQ22/JAV1 RNAi lines showed enhanced resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hu et al., 2013</a>).

This WRKY web appears to be deeply interconnected to various hormonal pathways at multiple levels, probably to ensure rapid and efficient signal amplification while allowing for tighter control in limiting the extent of the host immune response (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eulgem, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Llorca et al., 2014</a>)."

This study revealed that genes involved in ABA biosynthesis and directly regulated by WRKY33 act at crucial nodes in this signaling cascade. Due to the complexity of the highly interconnected hormonal signaling networks targeted by WRKY33, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance remain to be fully elucidated. In this respect, global transcriptional profiling of infected <i>wrky33 nced3 nced5</i> plants should prove extremely valuable to further narrow down key genes and sub-signaling pathways required to re-establish WT-like levels of resistance in this mutant."

Our analysis found that both the W-box and the T/GTTGAAT motifs that are located within our WRKY33 ChIP peak regions tend to be associated more strongly with CNS than the corresponding motifs outside of WRKY33 ChIP peaks. Still, overall the T/GTTGAAT motif is less common in the At genome, seems to be less enriched in CNS in general and also the association with CNS observed for motifs within WRKY33 ChIP peaks is clearly less pronounced than for the W-box. Taken together, we think that our exploratory analyses do not sufficiently support that this T/GTTGAAT motifs is strongly conserved and therefore undergoing evolutionary selection (if requested by the reviewers we can also supply the detailed results of our analyses). Thus, we feel at this stage we should not speculate too much on this point and therefore also are reluctant to include it in our manuscript."

We synthesized two oligonucleotides containing the new motif (T/GTTGAAT) that were derived from two promoter sequences that we identified as WRKY33 targets in our ChIP-seq studies, and that resided within WRKY33 binding regions. One 45 bp oligonucleotide (designated M-3) was deduced from the <i>PROPEP3</i> gene promoter (At5g64905) and contained three copies of this new motif, and a second 40 bp oligonucleotide (designated M-7) derived from the <i>WAKL7</i> gene promoter (At1g16090), which contained one copy.

This normalization approach has been shown before e.g. by Dillies at al., 2012 (PubMed ID: 22988256) to be more efficient than the classic RPKM/FPKM normalization (at least when used without application of further scaling as done e.g. in newer versions of CuffDiff) and comparable to the normalization method used in DESeq/DESeq2. This TMM normalization was combined with a log2 transform to yield log2-counts per million (log2cpm) using the function \u2018voom\u2019 in the R package limma, which additionally estimates the mean-variance relationship for the log-counts and assigns a weight to each observation based on its predicted variance. These weights are then used in the subsequent linear modeling process to adjust for heteroscedasticity as described by <a href=\"#bib42\">Law et al., 2014</a> (PubMed ID: 24485249). This normalization procedure and subsequent linear modeling in limma (voom-limma) have been shown previously e.g. by Rapaport et al., 2013 (PubMed ID: 24020486) and Seyednasrollah et al., 2013 (PubMed ID: 24300110) to perform well at detecting differentially expressed genes on different datasets with respect to both sensitivity and specificity (also when compared with CuffDiff), and to be among the best tools when the number of replicates is relatively low, like with the three replicates we are analyzing."

The suggested tool CuffDiff addresses this problem by combining the differential expression analysis with isoform deconvolution and is a reasonable and thus widely used alternative. However, we believe that the estimation of isoform-specific expression is a very difficult task, especially for genes with strongly overlapping isoforms and at moderate sequencing depths, and accordingly any isoform-specific expression estimates inevitably are associated with a certain degree of uncertainty. Overall, we think both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, and, at least for the analysis of gene-level expression differences we are focusing on in this study, our workflow is just as much a reasonable approach as the suggested CuffDiff."

We also agree with the reviewers that the potential existence of such a bias would in turn result in a bias in the downstream GO term enrichment analysis. Thus, we explicitly checked our DE sets for the presence of such a bias, and an analysis of the gene length distributions did not reveal any evidence for a bias toward longer genes in our DE gene sets, also when compared to the DE gene sets obtained with the suggested alternative tool CuffDiff (<a href=\"#fig12\">Author response image 4</a>). However, the observed read counts in an RNA-seq experiment can be biased not only by differences in transcript length, but also by further factors like differences in sequence composition or secondary structure. Moreover, the gene set on which we actually performed the GO enrichment analysis contained only the subset of DE genes (wrky33 \u201cregulated\u201d) that were also found to be bound in our ChIP-seq (wrky33 \u201ctargets\u201d), and it has been shown that also the identification of ChIP-seq targets can have a bias on more highly expressed genes. Thus, we additionally checked our specific gene sets of interest (\u201cregulated\u201d, \u201ctargets\u201d, \u201cregulated targets\u201d) for the presence of an expression bias in general (<a href=\"#fig13\">Author response image 5</a>). As the ChIP-seq targets did indeed seem to have a certain bias towards higher expressed genes, we re-did the GO term enrichment analysis with a different tool (goseq) that can account for this potential expression bias in the analyzed gene set through the integration of a probability weighting function. In this way we can, within the GOterm analysis itself, correct for any expression bias in the analyzed gene set and thus reduce the chance of false positive detections. We have updated the corresponding text and figures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) in our manuscript to now represent the results of this new GO term analysis with expression bias correction (which overall agree quite well with the previous analysis) and also adjusted the methods description accordingly."
