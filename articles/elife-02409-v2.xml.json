                    "text": "One of the key questions in biology is how the metabolism of a cell responds to changes in the environment. In budding yeast, starvation causes a drop in intracellular pH, but the functional role of this pH change is not well understood. Here, we show that the enzyme glutamine synthetase (Gln1) forms filaments at low pH and that filament formation leads to enzymatic inactivation. Filament formation by Gln1 is a highly cooperative process, strongly dependent on macromolecular crowding, and involves back-to-back stacking of cylindrical homo-decamers into filaments that associate laterally to form higher order fibrils. Other metabolic enzymes also assemble into filaments at low pH. Hence, we propose that filament formation is a general mechanism to inactivate and store key metabolic enzymes during a state of advanced cellular starvation. These findings have broad implications for understanding the interplay between nutritional stress, the metabolism and the physical organization of a cell."

In budding yeast, starvation causes a drop in intracellular pH, but the functional role of this pH change is not well understood. Here, we show that the enzyme glutamine synthetase (Gln1) forms filaments at low pH and that filament formation leads to enzymatic inactivation. Filament formation by Gln1 is a highly cooperative process, strongly dependent on macromolecular crowding, and involves back-to-back stacking of cylindrical homo-decamers into filaments that associate laterally to form higher order fibrils. Other metabolic enzymes also assemble into filaments at low pH. Hence, we propose that filament formation is a general mechanism to inactivate and store key metabolic enzymes during a state of advanced cellular starvation. These findings have broad implications for understanding the interplay between nutritional stress, the metabolism and the physical organization of a cell."

A different but equally effective strategy for localized biochemistry involves the formation of phase-separated macromolecular assemblies, which are built de novo from proteins and RNAs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brangwynne, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hyman and Simons, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">O'Connell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wilson and Gitai, 2013</a>).

Such intermediate-sized (or mesoscale) assemblies often have specific functions that are intricately linked to their higher order complexity."

Liquid-like assemblies are disordered and very dynamic (the components turn over on the order of seconds to minutes) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brangwynne et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2012</a>), whereas crystalline assemblies are more ordered and static (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yeates et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wilson and Gitai, 2013</a>). The distinctive properties of these assemblies also entail different geometries: liquid-like assemblies are usually spherical, whereas crystalline assemblies adopt a broader variety of shapes, ranging from linear polymers and two-dimensional polymer sheets to extensively cross-linked three-dimensional crystals. Modern imaging techniques are now enabling us to unravel the various ways in which nature uses such organizational principles to functionally diversify the subcellular landscape."

Metabolic enzymes in particular are able to self-assemble into higher order structures (<a href=\"#bib40\">O'Connell et al., 2012</a>), suggesting an important role in regulating the metabolism of cells. These findings establish a link to earlier work from Paul Srere and colleagues, who proposed that metabolic enzymes undergo static and dynamic interactions to spatiotemporally organize and regulate metabolic pathways (<a href=\"#bib50\">Srere, 1987</a>). Such organizational specificity was believed to be necessary to ensure metabolic efficiency. Additional studies suggest that self-assembling metabolic enzymes can be co-opted for other functional roles. A particularly striking example is that of cytidine triphosphate synthase, a bacterial enzyme that forms cytoskeletal filaments with cell morphological functions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ingerson-Mahar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barry and Gitai, 2011</a>)."

The metabolic reactions catalyzed by these newly identified enzymes were diverse, but the conditions under which they assembled appeared to be similar: filament formation was most frequently observed, when cells entered stationary phase or were depleted of their primary energy source: glucose. This suggests a functional association with the energy-depleted cellular state, an assumption that has so far remained untested. Moreover, it is not yet clear whether these assemblies are catalytically active, serve as enzyme storage compartments, or are protein aggregates."

Using yeast glutamine synthetase (Gln1) as a model enzyme, we show that filament formation involves the repeated stacking of homo-decameric enzyme complexes by a back-to-back mechanism. We further demonstrate that filament assembly is triggered by a starvation-induced drop in the intracellular pH and results in enzymatic inactivation and the formation of enzyme storage depots. Importantly, these findings also extend to other filament-forming proteins, arguing that filament formation by metabolic enzymes is a specific adaptation that allows yeast to endure and recover from severe starvation conditions."

Indeed, when we co-expressed untagged and GFP-tagged Gln1 in yeast, the punctate localization pattern disappeared, and Gln1-GFP assembled into a few filaments per cell (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To verify this finding, we replaced endogenous Gln1 with a version containing a C-terminal tetracystein tag. This stretch of six amino acids can be labeled with small dyes such as FlAsH (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2002</a>). Indeed, FlAsH-labeled Gln1 assembled into filaments in cells that were transferred from media to buffer (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In a search for a protein-encoded fluorescent tag that is compatible with the filamentous state, we replaced the GFP tag in the endogenous <i>GLN1</i> locus with mCherry. Indeed, unlike GFP-tagged Gln1, mCherry-tagged Gln1 assembled into filaments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The number of filaments per cell as well as the kinetics of filament formation was comparable to our previous experiment with predominantly untagged Gln1 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data indicate that mCherry is compatible with the filamentous state and therefore a suitable fluorophore to study the localization of Gln1 in living cells."

Importantly, when we transferred the cells into a phosphate buffer that contained no metabolizable nutrients, filaments were detectable in all cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, under conditions of severe starvation, the filament formation phenotype becomes fully penetrant. This suggests that filament formation by metabolic enzymes is a starvation-induced cellular adaptation. Here, we refer to this specific cellular state as the state of advanced starvation."

However, we observed extensive variation from cell to cell, suggesting that yeast vary in their ability to deal with sudden energy depletion (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Importantly, addition of glucose to buffer was sufficient to prevent filament formation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We also found that cells can fully recover from the state of advanced starvation. Upon resupply of nutrients, filament dissolved very rapidly, and shortly after filament dissolution cells re-entered into the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3 and 4</a>). On average, filament dissolution was completed \u223c18 min after nutrient addition (n = 65; SD = 11.6 min).

The enzyme is composed of two pentameric rings that interact to form a face-to-face homo-decamer. This structural arrangement is identical to those of mammalian and plant glutamine synthetases. Curiously, however, the crystal structure of yeast Gln1 also revealed a new back-to-back association between two decamers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The biological significance of this novel interface, however, remained undetermined."

To test this assumption, we mutated specific residues in the interface (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1, 2 and 3</a>). The resulting Gln1 variants were fused to mCherry and tested in yeast for their ability to assemble into filaments. We found three mutations (E186K, P83R, T49E) that abrogated the ability of Gln1 to form filaments in starved cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Intriguingly, we also identified two mutants that formed filaments in growing cells. The Y81A mutant had a slightly increased propensity to form filaments, whereas the R23E mutant formed filaments constitutively, regardless of the growth conditions. To test whether the R23E mutant effect could be neutralized by a second mutation, we introduced the inhibitory T49E mutation into the R23E variant. Indeed, the double mutant (R23E, T49E) was no longer able to form filaments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), indicating that the increased propensity to form filaments can be overcome by an inhibitory second site mutation. These findings indicate that the propensity to form filaments can be modulated by specific mutations in Gln1. They also suggest that the decamer\u2013decamer interface is biologically important."

From this point on we will use a color code to facilitate discrimination between the different mutant forms of Gln1.

First, we investigated the oligomeric state of wild-type and variant Gln1 by blue native PAGE and immunoblotting. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, the predominant form of Gln1 was a decamer. Importantly, however, we also identified distinct bands that corresponded to higher molecular weight forms of the enzyme. These assemblies were predominantly detectable for the wild-type and the R23E variant. Moreover, when compared to wild-type Gln1, the constitutively filament-forming R23E variant showed an increased number of these higher order assemblies."

First, we determined whether Gln1 filaments could be stained with Thioflavin T (a dye that specifically binds to cross-\u03b2 structure), and second, we subjected lysates from filament-containing cells to semi-denaturing detergent\u2013agarose gel electrophoresis (a method that detects cross-\u03b2 structure based on its resistance to detergent) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alberti et al., 2010</a>).

As a next step, we isolated His-tagged R23E Gln1 from yeast cells and investigated the purified protein by negative staining and electron microscopy. We identified short filamentous structures, which, upon closer inspection, revealed that they were formed by a repeating unit that precisely matched the dimensions of a Gln1 decamer (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>).

The ultrastructural features of the mCherry-positive structures are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>. The electron micrographs show a large number of filaments, which are laterally aligned into higher order bundles. This side-by-side bundling is consistent with the growth pattern of the filaments, which was predominately in the longitudinal direction but also included some increase in circumference over time (see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). To exclude that the bundling was caused by the mCherry tag, we performed a careful ultrastructural analysis of yeast cells that expressed untagged R23E. Indeed, we could also identify fibrillar structures in the cytoplasm of R23E-expressing cells but not in control cells (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). However, we noticed that the filaments were in closer contact, suggesting that the mCherry tag has some influence on the packing density. Together, these findings indicate that Gln1 assembles into filaments by a back-to-back stacking mechanism. Once formed, these filaments can organize into higher order fibrils."

When we lysed filament-containing yeast, the filaments were unstable (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To identify components that are necessary for filament integrity, we performed experiments with modified lysis buffers. One obvious difference to yeast cytoplasm was that the lysis buffer lacked a high background concentration of macromolecules. We therefore tested the influence of macromolecular crowders on filament stability. Strikingly, when we added the crowding agent Ficoll 70 at a concentration close to the physiological concentration of macromolecules (200 mg/ml), the filaments remained intact (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

The samples were subsequently analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for the formation of higher order structures. Intriguingly, we found that R23E Gln1 formed filamentous structures in the presence of a crowder but not in its absence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Importantly, similar structures could not be detected when we replaced R23E with the assembly-incompetent variant P83R. Further inspection of in vitro formed Gln1 filaments revealed structures of varying thickness (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This suggests that in vitro reconstituted filaments are able to assemble into higher order bundles, as in yeast cells. Thus, we conclude that the assembly of Gln1 is strongly dependent on macromolecular crowding but independent of other cellular components."

These experiments showed that the stability of R23E filaments could not only be increased by crowders but also by acidifying the lysis buffer.

This is because yeast cells have to continuously expend energy to maintain the proton gradient across the plasma membrane (usually yeast media are acidic). To test whether pH changes are sufficient to trigger the assembly of Gln1, we artificially acidified the cytoplasm by adding the protonophore 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) to dividing yeast. Strikingly, acidified yeast abundantly formed filamentous structures, despite the presence of glucose (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Next, we tested whether a neutral or basic outside pH could prevent the formation of filaments in energy-depleted yeast. Indeed, starved yeast maintained in a buffer of pH 7 contained shorter and smaller filaments than yeast in a buffer of pH 5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

To follow pH-induced assembly over time, we exposed bacterially purified Gln1 to an acidic buffer and monitored the formation of higher order structures by dynamic light scattering. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, Gln1 progressively assembled into higher order structures, whereas a mutant version of Gln1 (E186K) did not.

To study whether cytosolic acidification is also required for formation of these assemblies, we tagged one protein in each filament with GFP. We then determined the frequency of filaments in yeast cells that were resuspended in different pH-adjusted buffers. Because these buffers lacked an energy source, the starved cells rapidly adopted the outside pH. Intriguingly, we found that all three proteins formed filaments in a strongly pH-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Moreover, filament formation was almost completely abrogated at a neutral or basic pH. We then tested if we could induce filament formation in growing cells by adding the protonophore DNP.

Indeed, Gln1 was progressively inactivated under conditions of advanced starvation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), and the extent of inactivation correlated with the amount of filament formation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Next, we compared the enzymatic activities of wild-type and mutant Gln1. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, the R23E variant displayed a strongly reduced synthetase activity. Because these activity measurements were performed with cell lysates, we hypothesized that the actual enzymatic inactivation is much stronger in intact cells. To investigate this possibility, we inspected wild-type and variant Gln1 variants for growth phenotypes. Consistent with the essential function of Gln1, the constitutively assembling R23E variant had a strongly diminished ability to grow (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Importantly, this growth deficiency was abrogated by a second site mutation that prevents filament formation (T49E), indicating that filament formation is the cause of the reduced growth rate. Moreover, cells growing on glutamine as the sole nitrogen source (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) showed no growth defect, suggesting that this deficiency was due to the inability of the cells to produce sufficient amounts of the growth-promoting amino acid glutamine. Based on these findings, we conclude that filament formation during advanced starvation conditions silences the enzymatic activity of Gln1."

To address this question, we generated a yeast strain that expressed mCherry-tagged Gln1 from the inducible <i>GAL</i> promoter. Because of the essential nature of Gln1, this strain had to be maintained in the presence of galactose. To test whether assembled Gln1 can become enzymatically active again, we grew the strain in the presence of galactose and then induced starvation by transferring it into a phosphate buffer. After 4 hr of starvation the great majority of the cells had formed filaments. We then added glucose-containing growth medium to induce reentry into the cell cycle. Importantly, under these conditions, the <i>GAL</i> promoter is switched off, and Gln1 is no longer synthesized de novo. Therefore, the cells can only enter the cell cycle when they manage to reactivate enzyme complexes that were previously stored in filaments. Indeed, after the filaments had dissolved, the cells started to divide again (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Growth only stopped after several rounds of cell division, presumably because the amount of Gln1 was diluted below a critical concentration. Thus, we conclude that starvation-induced filaments can serve as storage depots for Gln1."

To investigate this question, we monitored the regrowth of yeast after a short episode of starvation. We hypothesized that the ratio of assembled to unassembled Gln1 should specifically affect the initial growth phase of recovering yeast. To investigate this possibility, we observed the growth of Y81A mutants immediately after nutrient re-supply (the Y81A mutant displayed slower filament dissolution kinetics, but no growth defect in plating assays, see <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 3 and 4</a>). As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, the Y81A strain showed significantly slower growth after exit from starvation than wild-type cells.

To investigate this possibility, we interfered with the ability of yeast to form filaments by starving them in buffers of neutral or basic pH for extended times. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, the regrowth of yeast was severely impaired in filamentation-inhibiting buffer (pH 7 or 8), whereas cells maintained in filamentation-promoting buffer (pH 6) showed fast recovery. This suggests that filament formation by metabolic enzymes is required for recovery from severe starvation. Thus, we conclude that filament formation is a specific adaptation that enables yeast to endure severe energy depletion stress."

                        "text": "How cells survive and recover from severe starvation is a largely unresolved question. Our findings suggest that this may involve extensive changes in the organization of the cytoplasm. We demonstrate that starvation induces the self-assembly of yeast glutamine synthetase into filaments by a simple back-to-back stacking mechanism (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> for a model of assembly). We further show that filament formation is triggered by starvation-induced acidification of the cytosol and results in enzyme inactivation. This catalytic inactivation is reversible, arguing that filaments are temporary storage depots for Gln1. Other filament-forming enzymes show a strikingly similar sensitivity to pH, and their growth-associated functions are probably not needed during advanced starvation. This suggests that the formation of inactive enzyme assemblies may be a general principle, which allows cells to adapt to low energy levels. Consistent with this, we found that filament formation regulates the regrowth of yeast after severe starvation. Recent findings indicate that quiescence-associated subcellular structures, such as proteasome storage granules and actin bodies, also form in a pH-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib45\">Peters et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, pH changes have been implicated in the regulation of stress-induced G protein signaling (<a href=\"#bib25\">Isom et al., 2013</a>). This strongly reinforces the notion that intracellular pH changes serve as a global messenger to signal the depletion of energy during starvation and cellular quiescence (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dechant et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Orij et al., 2012</a>). In fact, pH-induced formation of filamentous structures may be a more widespread phenomenon in nature, as shown for example by the finding that spider silk formation is induced by low pH (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kronqvist et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "How does the pH regulate the formation of Gln1 filaments? We noticed that Gln1 has a theoretical isoelectric point of around 6. Starvation-induced changes in the cytosolic pH will therefore strongly reduce its net charge. Thus, an overall reduction of repulsive interactions or altered charge distributions at the interface\u2014which the mutations introduced in this study may modulate\u2014are likely to be the driving force for assembly. An alternative scenario is that protons act as allosteric effectors that induce structural changes at the decamer\u2013decamer interface. Accordingly, the behavior of the Gln1 mutants could also be explained by an increased or decreased propensity to undergo structural changes. However, currently we have no evidence that protonation induces large conformational changes. Regardless of the specific mechanism, what is evident is that a drop in intracellular pH induces the formation of an attractive interface at the two ends of a decameric Gln1 particle. The steric self-compatibility of this interface and the highly symmetric cylindrical structure of Gln1 then promote the assembly of Gln1 into extended filaments. Once formed, these filaments are able to associate side by side to form higher order bundles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>)."

The individual stacking reactions seem to be quite stable at low pH, whereas the final filamentous structure was vulnerable to even mild perturbations. This suggests that the higher order assembly of filaments into microscopically visible fibrils is a cooperative and less favorable process. In agreement with this, we found that the formation of fibrils was strongly dependent on a macromolecular crowding agent. This indicates that the assembly reaction is not only driven enthalpically by chemical interface\u2013interface interactions but also entropically by excluded volume effects (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Consistent with this, protein associations are often enhanced by macromolecular crowding (<a href=\"#bib35\">Minton, 2001</a>), and crowding effects become particularly relevant in a self-assembling structure with multiple units. Accordingly, a recent theoretical study proposed an important role for crowding in the formation of mesoscale assemblies (<a href=\"#bib34\">Marenduzzo et al., 2006</a>). This suggests that macromolecular crowding may have a key role in reorganizing the cytoplasm of starved cells."

This finding and the highly ordered structural arrangement of Gln1 into fibrils argues against the possibility that these filaments are protein aggregates consisting of misfolded proteins. Thus, we conclude that starvation-induced filament formation is not a chaotic protein aggregation event but a desired outcome of a protective cellular program. During its lifetime, a given yeast cell repeatedly transitions into and out of starvation, suggesting that on evolutionary time scales the yeast cytoplasm must have undergone numerous pH fluctuations. This makes it very likely that specific adjustments have been made to optimize the behavior of protein complexes in an energy-depleted and acidified cytoplasm. This consideration is also supported by the fact that other protein complexes assemble into distinct, starvation-induced structures that do not intermix (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sagot et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Laporte et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Laporte et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2012</a>).

How filament formation induces enzymatic inactivation is unclear, but we suspect that assembled Gln1 can no longer undergo the conformational changes that are required for enzymatic activity. It is also conceivable that the substrate cannot gain access to the catalytic site. However, when starved yeast cells are re-exposed to nutrients, intracellular pH levels rise and Gln1 filaments disassemble, thus shifting the enzyme back into its active form. In agreement with this, we found that the ability to dissolve filaments specifically affects the ability of yeast to re-grow after starvation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Moreover, preventing the starvation-induced decline in intracellular pH severely impaired the ability of yeast to recover from prolonged starvation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), suggesting that filament formation by metabolic enzymes is required for survival of extensive energy depletion stress."

Second, filament formation may promote the transition into or recovery from a more solid and probably protective material state of the cytoplasm, as has been proposed for bacteria (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parry et al., 2014</a>). Third, filament formation may promote entry into a hypometabolic state that makes energy-depleted cells more resistant to metabolic fluctuations (enzyme inactivation by filament formation may provide a buffer against metabolic fluctuations, thus preventing accidental re-entry into the cell cycle). Fourth, enzyme inactivation may help conserve energy as part of a cell-wide energy conservation program, as has been proposed for mammalian cells containing ADF/cofilin filaments (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bernstein and Bamburg, 2010</a>).

We reveal the cytosolic pH as a key regulator of this process and show that assembly into higher order structures can modulate the activity of proteins. Several earlier studies reported intracellular pH changes in response to environmental perturbations. The slime mold <i>Dictyostelium</i> for example experiences a drop in cytosolic pH during starvation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gross et al., 1983</a>) and in response to stress (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pintsch et al., 2001</a>). Additional findings in bacteria and metazoans point to an important role of the intracellular pH in controlling transitions into and out of hypometabolic states. Among others, pH changes have been shown to control entry into dormancy in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib48\">Setlow and Setlow, 1980</a>), brine shrimp (<a href=\"#bib14\">Busa and Crowe, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hand et al., 2011</a>), and land snails (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barnhart and Mcmahon, 1988</a>), as well as hibernation in mammalians, amphibians, and reptiles (<a href=\"#bib33\">Malan, 2014</a>). The intracellular pH also regulates cellular metabolism more generally in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Busa and Nuccitelli, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Moolenaar, 1986</a>), and promotes tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib51\">Webb et al., 2011</a>) and the exit from quiescence (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zetterberg and Engstrom, 1981</a>). These collective findings reveal intracellular pH changes as an evolutionarily ancient signal that directs developmental programs and mediates metabolic restructuring during energy limitation. It will be interesting to revisit these and other cases in the light of our findings."

To allow alignment of EM and light microscopy (LM) images, unstained sections on EM grids were incubated with quenched 200 nm Blue (365/415) FluoSpheres as fiducials. Grids were mounted on a glass slide with VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, USA) and viewed in both red (for mCherry) and UV (for the fiducials) channels. After staining for TEM, regions of interest in LM were relocated in TEM. Montaged images were acquired at multiple magnifications to facilitate the correlation. LM and TEM images were overlayed in ZIBAmira (Zuse-Institut, Berlin, Germany)."

This is consistent with the interpretation that Gln1 decamers largely remain intact in the assembled state. We also performed electron microscopy on negatively stained R23E Gln1 isolated from yeast cells. In these samples, we identified filaments with a diameter of \u223c120 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 6</a>). These filaments are formed by a structural unit that roughly repeats every 100 \u00c5. These size proportions are consistent with the previously reported dimensions of Gln1 decamers (<a href=\"#bib22\">He et al., 2009</a>). This indicates that the structure of Gln1 remains intact and that assembly proceeds by the proposed back-to-back stacking mechanism."

First, we subjected lysates from yeast to semi-denaturing detergent- agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE). This method identifies cross-\u03b2 structures based on their resistance to detergents. As can now be seen in <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 5</a>, filament formation is not associated with an increased resistance to detergent. We further treated yeast cells containing Gln1 filaments with Thioflavin T (ThT), a dye that specifically binds to cross-\u03b2 structure. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 4</a>, the Gln1 filaments could not be stained with ThT, whereas control cross-\u03b2 filaments showed strong ThT binding (these control samples were processed in parallel in the same experiment).

We also performed experiments to reverse Gln1 assembly by raising the pH, but we found that disassembly was incomplete. However, we do not interpret this as evidence that the <i>in vitro</i> structures are different from the ones formed <i>in vivo</i>, mainly for two reasons. First, mutations that abrogated filament formation <i>in vivo</i> also prevented filament formation <i>in vitro</i> (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3D and 4D</a>), strongly suggesting that the <i>in vitro</i> structures are physiological. Second, pH experiments to dissolve preformed filaments in permeabilized yeasts were also unsuccessful, suggesting that a pH increase alone is not sufficient to fully reverse filamentation. So far complete reversal could only be achieved by exposing previously starved cells to glucose. Therefore, it seems that in addition to a change in pH, complete reversal requires other factors, such as ATP, small metabolites or the action of molecular chaperones. Experiments to investigate the mechanism of filament disassembly are underway and will be reported elsewhere."

To be able to identify untagged wildtype Gln1, we had to perform experiments with starved cells to induce filament formation. We noticed, however, that the cytoplasm of starved yeast contained many structures that were not present in actively dividing cells. Given the multiplicity of ultrastructural changes, we were unable to reliably identify the specific structures that are caused by Gln1."

Moreover, yeasts acidify their media as a result of metabolic activity. Thus yeast cells prefer and actively create an acidic environment that is favorable for growth. As a consequence, however, growing yeasts have to expend energy to remove protons from the cytosol. Therefore, even small fluctuations in energy status can lead to fluctuations in intracellular pH. Yeast may, however, be special in this regard, because other organisms have found ways to acidify their cytoplasm independently of the outside pH (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hand et al., 2011</a>)."

However, these fungi also carry mutations in proximity to the newly introduced amino acids, so it is possible that these changes have been compensated for by mutations elsewhere in the protein. Based on these findings we cautiously conclude that the filament-forming abilities of Gln1 are conserved and not selected against."
