The observation that cells of a given type often have a narrow size distribution suggests that cell size is tightly controlled, and one can try to rationalize this observation in various ways (<a href=\"#bib45\">Young, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ginzberg et al., 2015</a>). For instance, one may speculate that diffusion will limit the supply of nutrients in large cells due to their small surface-area-to-volume ratio: however, many microbes are order of magnitudes smaller than any limit imposed by diffusion (<a href=\"#bib20\">Landy, 2014</a>).

Here we will refute this interpretation and suggest that, in certain cases, size may be a\u00a0'spandrel'\u00a0in the sense coined by Gould\u00a0and\u00a0Lewontin (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gould and Lewontin, 1979</a>): in other words, cell size may be a \"phenotypic characteristic that is a byproduct of the evolution of some other characteristic, rather than a direct product of adaptive selection\" (to use the definition given by Wikipedia). The dependence of cell size on growth conditions, we shall argue, is not an adaptation but a causal consequence of a particular regulation scheme, whose primary purpose is otherwise."

Within this model, which appears to capture many experimental results, a new round of DNA replication is initiated when the cell has <i>accumulated</i> a critical biomass (or volume) per each origin of replication from the previous initiation. This 'adder per origin' model has the virtue of tightly regulating the number of replication forks, and we will suggest that this should have more significant implications on cell fitness than changes in cellular dimensions. We also briefly discuss the potential molecular mechanisms for implementing this control strategy."

In contrast to eukaryotes, bacteria initiate new rounds of DNA replication in a synchronous fashion: that is, the number of origins of replications double within a time frame that is short compared to the cell cycle duration (<a href=\"#bib33\">Skarstad et al., 1986</a>). This implies that the number of origins on the circular chromosome will be of the form 2<sup>n</sup> with n an integer (see <a href=\"#bib47\">Zaritsky et al., 2011</a>) for a schematric illustration of the chromosome in fast growth conditions, and Figure 6 of <a href=\"#bib17\">Hill et al., 2012</a> for examples of the origin number distributions at different growth conditions)."

In order to make this extrapolation, additional information is necessary. First, what is the dependence of cell volume on time, at the single-cell level? Donachie assumed that cells grow exponentially over time. Later works verified that protein synthesis increases exponentially with time (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cooper, 1988</a>), and more recently it was directly verified that the buoyant mass of cells also increases exponentially with time (<a href=\"#bib10\">Godin et al., 2010</a>). These observations are consistent with the notion that the composition of the cytoplasm is approximately constant during the cell cycle. Taken together with the <i>constancy</i> of the length of time between initiation of DNA replication and cell division, these results provide sufficient information to calculate the cell size at DNA replication initiation. The fact that <math id=\"inf7\"><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>60</mn></mrow></math> minutes appears in both the SMK growth law and in the context of DNA replication led Donachie to an intriguing conclusion: at the moment of initiation of DNA replication, <i>the average cell size is proportional to the number of origins per cell in that growth condition</i>. This has since been observed in other bacterial species (<a href=\"#bib32\">Sharpe et al., 1998</a>), and has recently been directly verified in experiments where cell volume was measured at the time of DNA replication initiation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wallden et al., 2016</a>).

This model couples DNA replication, growth and division robustly, while elucidating the SMK growth law, which would be a causal consequence of the model.

It is 1 for perfectly correlated variables, \u22121 for perfectly anti-correlated variables, and 0 for independent variables. Assuming a constant growth\u00a0rate (which is a good approximation in many cases, including <i>E. coli</i> in fast growth conditions), it can be shown that a critical cell size for division will eliminate any correlations between cell size at birth and division (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amir, 2014</a>). This is illustrated schematically in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. More generally, a critical cell size for entering a new cell cycle stage which precedes division by a constant time (as in Donachie\u2019s model) will also lead to vanishing correlations between birth and division size, i.e., a cell that is born smaller than average will take longer to reach that threshold size, but there will be no systematic bias for it to divide smaller than average \u2013 the memory of the initial conditions is \u2018washed away\u2019 by thresholding."

Changing this dependence will no doubt have significant consequences on fitness.\u00a0Yet changes in cell size do not have that effect, and we may change cell size by tens or hundreds of percent without any measurable effect on the doubling time (which can typically be determined to accuracy within a few percent). For instance, thymine-limitation slows down the replication rate: this extends the duration of DNA replication, which is known as the C period, and leads to significantly larger cells with unperturbed doubling times (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pritchard and Zaritsky, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zaritsky and Pritchard, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zaritsky et al., 2011</a>).

In these experiments fitness should be strongly correlated with the growth rate, and inversely proportional to the doubling time (this would be precise in the case where cell growth is in exponential phase and is not affected by growth of other cells in the culture). It is observed that together with the fitness increase, cell size also increases, see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. According to our model, this is not an adaptation of the cell to the growth conditions, but a causal consequence of the increase in growth rate, which is presumably what is being selected for. Note that we expect the growth rate to be under strong selection, and not <math id=\"inf23\"><mi>T</mi></math>. While the latter affects the number of DNA replication forks, it should not have much impact on the growth rate \u2013 since the essence of multiple replication forks is precisely in bypassing the constraint imposed by DNA replication on the cell\u2019s doubling time. It would be interesting to study the dynamics of the duration <math id=\"inf24\"><mi>T</mi></math> in these evolution experiments, which previous results suggest might even increase over time (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mongold and Lenski, 1996</a>), enhancing further the effect on cell size."

We discussed a model in which control occurs over the initiation of DNA replication \u2013 rather than cell division. The model is able to reconcile observations regarding the bacterial cell size which <i>a priori</i> seem to be contradictory. Importantly, the very same model regulates not only size, but also the number of replication forks \u2013 allowing the cell to efficiently proliferate in differing environmental conditions."

In the case of budding yeast, recent work enhances our molecular-level understanding of cell size control (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schmoller et al., 2015</a>), and some progress was made relating this molecular mechanism to phenomenological models (<a href=\"#bib34\">Soifer et al., 2016</a>). It is also known that budding yeast cell volume is dependent on the growth rate (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tyson et al., 1979</a>). It would be interesting to explore whether this dependence could arise from cell cycle 'architecture' (since the term spandrel has its origins in architecture). The numerous differences between the eukaryotic and bacterial cell cycles (for instance, that initiation occurs from many origins on each chromosome, asynchronously) suggests that a different kind of spandrel\u00a0\u2013 yet to be determined \u2013 might be needed to elucidate this observation. In any case, it seems that being cautious in our interpretation of such dependencies (that\u00a0is, interpreting cell size dependence on growth rate as cellular adaption) could potentially be a lesson more broadly applicable."

Ultimately, further work should be able to bridge the gap between our improving phenomenological understanding of the coupling between cell growth, division and DNA replication, and our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying these processes. The two approaches, molecular level and phenomenological studies, are complementary, and may supplement and benefit each other. The various quantitative laws discovered in bacteria are, in many ways, microscopes that\u00a0provide us with new insights into the cell cycle.\u00a0What we see with them should also\u00a0inform and enhance our understanding at other levels, putting major constraints on the potential molecular mechanisms."

In the discussion between reviewers, it was suggested to add a simple drawing that shows the difference in birth volumes predicted by the two models ('old' model and 'new' one, please see main comment Reviewer #3) during what is referred to as a noisy or faulty cell cycle. For instance, one could show that if a cell happened to initiate at some time after it had reached the critical volume/origin and then produced larger-than-average progeny, the timing and volume increase for the subsequent division would differ in the two models, with the new model being consistent with the recent findings with single cells. This type of drawing is thought to better clarify the main thrust of this manuscript."

I believe that initiation of DNA synthesis occurs when there is an amount of \"initiation mass\" present for each origin and at that time initiations of DNA replication take place. Throughout the cell cycle I believe that mass is made simply and exponentially with mass increasing in proportion to extant mass at each time during bacterial growth during the cell cycle. I also believe that there are no variations in the composition of the \"cytoplasm\" of the cell during the cell cycle and that mass grows simply and exponentially during the cell cycle. I do not know precisely how initiation occurs, but following initiation of DNA replication over a range of growth rates the rate of DNA replication is relatively invariant and the time after termination of a round of replication till cell division is also relatively invariant. As pointed out by Dr. Amir in his review (which in that part is quite good) the size variation of cells as a function of growth rate is simply determined by this invariance of DNA replication and time from termination to division. The data from 1958 and 1968 fit these ideas extremely well."

Whenever there a deviation from the predictions of the Ptolmaic system arose, a new epicycle is added to the extant cycles and more and more epicycles are used to make the observations fit to the Ptolmaic system. Analogously, I find the papers cited in Dr. Amir's paper, and in the submitted paper, an attempt to take weak data based on single cell measurements which are questionable (in my viewpoint) to fit the data by adding more and more slight variations in order to accommodate some published data."

It basically states that the timing of a chromosomal initiation-of-replication event is determined by processes that take place subsequent to the previous initiation event, possibly but not necessarily, accumulation of an \"initiator\". As a consequence, the model places cell size control in the hands of initiation, and demands new thinking as to how initiation, and as a consequence the cell cycle, are controlled. It is a very satisfying idea because it is consistent with decades of information on the relationship between replication initiation and cell size, and with recent findings that cells growing at a specific rate add, on average, a constant volume from birth to division."

These latter statements, taken alone, read too much like the old ideas that were proposed almost 50 years ago and still repeated even in papers published this year, i.e., that initiation takes place whenever a fixed active unit of initiator has accumulated per chromosomal origin (which is reflected in a fixed size/origin), and then cells divide C+D min later. That old proposal, as satisfying as it has been all these years, is wrong if taken literally and not modified, as proposed by the author, to state that it matters when the accumulation takes place, in order to be consistent with current data on cell size at division. I simply suggest that Amir make some changes in the manuscript so that the novelty of his ideas and their significance stand out better. In my opinion, this should also include changing the description of his model from \"multiple origins accumulation\" to something that reflects when this accumulation takes place. Whether or not Amir's model is correct, it is the most interesting idea on the overall picture of cell cycle control to appear in some time and needs to be promoted as a new way to think about the molecular basis of the initiation process."

In the discussion between reviewers, it was suggested to add a simple drawing that shows the difference in birth volumes predicted by the two models ('old' model and 'new' one, please see main comment Reviewer #3) during what is referred to as a noisy or faulty cell cycle. For instance, one could show that if a cell happened to initiate at some time after it had reached the critical volume/origin and then produced larger-than-average progeny, the timing and volume increase for the subsequent division would differ in the two models, with the new model being consistent with the recent findings with single cells. This type of drawing is thought to better clarify the main thrust of this manuscript.</i>"

I believe that initiation of DNA synthesis occurs when there is an amount of \"initiation mass\" present for each origin and at that time initiations of DNA replication take place. Throughout the cell cycle I believe that mass is made simply and exponentially with mass increasing in proportion to extant mass at each time during bacterial growth during the cell cycle. I also believe that there are no variations in the composition of the \"cytoplasm\" of the cell during the cell cycle and that mass grows simply and exponentially during the cell cycle. I do not know precisely how initiation occurs, but following initiation of DNA replication over a range of growth rates the rate of DNA replication is relatively invariant and the time after termination of a round of replication till cell division is also relatively invariant. As pointed out by Dr. Amir in his review (which in that part is quite good) the size variation of cells as a function of growth rate is simply determined by this invariance of DNA replication and time from termination to division. The data from 1958 and 1968 fit these ideas extremely well.</i>"

Analogously, I find the papers cited in Dr. Amir's paper, and in the submitted paper, an attempt to take weak data based on single cell measurements which are questionable (in my viewpoint) to fit the data by adding more and more slight variations in order to accommodate some published data.</i>"

It basically states that the timing of a chromosomal initiation-of-replication event is determined by processes that take place subsequent to the previous initiation event, possibly but not necessarily, accumulation of an \"initiator\". As a consequence, the model places cell size control in the hands of initiation, and demands new thinking as to how initiation, and as a consequence the cell cycle, are controlled. It is a very satisfying idea because it is consistent with decades of information on the relationship between replication initiation and cell size, and with recent findings that cells growing at a specific rate add, on average, a constant volume from birth to division.</i>"
