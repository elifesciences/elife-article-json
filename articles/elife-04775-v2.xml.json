To begin to reconcile these perspectives, we studied how the evolutionary conservation of genes associated with social behavior depends on regulatory context, and whether genes associated with social behavior exist in distinct regulatory and evolutionary contexts. We identified modules of co-expressed genes associated with age-based division of labor between nurses and foragers in the ant <i>Monomorium pharaonis</i>, and we studied the relationship between molecular evolution, connectivity, and expression. Highly connected and expressed genes were more evolutionarily conserved, as expected. However, compared to the rest of the genome, forager-upregulated genes were much more highly connected and conserved, while nurse-upregulated genes were less connected and more evolutionarily labile. Our results indicate that the genetic architecture of social behavior includes both highly connected and conserved components as well as loosely connected and evolutionarily labile components."

To begin to reconcile these perspectives, we studied how the evolutionary conservation of genes associated with social behavior depends on regulatory context, and whether genes associated with social behavior exist in distinct regulatory and evolutionary contexts. We identified modules of co-expressed genes associated with age-based division of labor between nurses and foragers in the ant <i>Monomorium pharaonis</i>, and we studied the relationship between molecular evolution, connectivity, and expression. Highly connected and expressed genes were more evolutionarily conserved, as expected. However, compared to the rest of the genome, forager-upregulated genes were much more highly connected and conserved, while nurse-upregulated genes were less connected and more evolutionarily labile. Our results indicate that the genetic architecture of social behavior includes both highly connected and conserved components as well as loosely connected and evolutionarily labile components."

For example, the insulin signaling pathway, which mediates an organism's response to its internal nutritional state, also influences its behavior (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ament et al., 2008</a>). The <i>genetic toolkit hypothesis</i> and related hypotheses propose that a conserved set of genes and gene pathways involved in core physiological processes such as metabolism and reproduction has been repeatedly used in the evolution of complex social behavior in diverse lineages (<a href=\"#bib76\">West-Eberhard, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Amdam et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Toth and Robinson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Toth et al., 2007</a>).

Recent comparative transcriptomic and genomic studies find low overlap in genes associated with social behavior in different highly social animals and instead highlight the importance of novel genes and rapid evolution of social traits (<a href=\"#bib30\">Johnson and Tsutsui, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ferreira et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Simola et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wissler et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Feldmeyer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Harpur et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sumner, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jasper et al., 2015</a>), in accordance with recent studies emphasizing the ubiquity of taxonomically restricted genes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Khalturin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tautz and Domazet-Loso, 2011</a>).

Research in a range of model organisms demonstrates that the degree of a gene's connectivity to the rest of the regulatory network and its level of expression is often negatively correlated with its rate of molecular evolution (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krylov et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hahn and Kern, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jovelin and Phillips, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ramsay et al., 2009</a>). For example, highly connected \u2018hub\u2019 genes are often highly expressed and evolutionarily conserved. Previous research has compared rates of molecular evolution for genes associated with reproductive division of labor in social insects (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hunt et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Harpur et al., 2014</a>), as well as other conditionally expressed phenotypes in other organisms (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brisson and Nuzhdin, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Leichty et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Purandare et al., 2014</a>), indicating that genes associated with the expression of worker traits experience elevated rates of molecular evolution. However, the relationships among molecular evolution, connectivity, and expression have been little explored in social insects and are generally little understood for genes associated with social behavior. As a result, it is unclear if observed differences in rates of molecular evolution are caused by differences in regulatory architecture, expression, or perhaps result from distinct evolutionary mechanisms such as kin selection, which may operate differentially on genes associated with social behavior relative to the rest of the genome (<a href=\"#bib42\">Linksvayer and Wade, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hall and Goodisman, 2012</a>).

We wished to examine which of the four worker behavioral samples (nursing larvae, foraging, grooming larvae, and worker\u2013worker trophallaxis [i.e., exchanging liquid food]) had distinct expression profiles vs all of the others. We used linear contrasts to determine the number of differentially expressed genes between the focal behavioral category and the other behaviors. Of these contrasts, only foragers and nurses had significantly different gene expression patterns, when compared to the rest, that is, there was no evidence that workers engaged in grooming and trophallaxis had distinct transcriptional states. Consequently, we focused subsequent analysis on nurse and forager behavioral categories, except in the construction of the co-expression networks, where all behavioral category and age class samples were used (see below). There were 1217 forager-upregulated, 1247 nurse-upregulated transcripts, and 14,907 transcripts that were not differentially expressed."

Such low overlap seems surprising, given that these two ants are in closely related ant genera, having diverged on the order of 50 Mya (<a href=\"#bib74\">Ward et al., 2014</a>). However, the comparison is not perfect, given substantial differences between the two studies in methodology used to characterize the behaviors, and in the technology used to measure gene expression (i.e., microarray vs RNA sequencing) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Manfredini et al., 2014</a>). We did not find significant overlap between lists of honey bee and pharaoh ant genes associated with age polyethism, consistent with results reported by the earlier fire ant study (<a href=\"#bib43\">Manfredini et al., 2014</a>). While we expected decreased overlap given that honey bees and ants diverged longer ago, \u223c170 Mya (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ronquist et al., 2012</a>), and represent independent origins of eusociality, the ant-honey bee comparison is also more problematic because the honey bee data are based on brain gene expression profiles whereas the fire ant and pharaoh ant data are based on whole body gene expression profiles."

In contrast, other authors have recently interpreted low overlap as being consistent with the novel social genes hypothesis, which emphasizes the importance of taxonomically restricted genes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ferreira et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Feldmeyer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sumner, 2014</a>). The contrasting emphasis of authors on either conserved or novel genes begs the question: what degree of conservation in gene lists is necessary for confirmation or rejection of these two hypotheses? For example, the fact that nurse-upregulated genes in <i>M. pharaonis</i> are more rapidly evolving than the rest of the genome and that 50% of nurse-upregulated genes do not have identifiable fire ant or honey bee orthologs suggests that novel genes may have important nurse-specific functions. At the same time, the significant overlap of fire ant and pharaoh ant gene lists and the strong enrichment of nurse-upregulated genes for gene ontology terms associated with metabolism and development suggests that conserved genes involved in core physiological processes also play important roles in nurse function and the evolution of division of labor. Thus, our results are generally consistent with both hypotheses. We suggest that neither of these two hypotheses has yet been formulated in a way that is readily tested, in part because it is unclear what precise genes are expected to be included or excluded from a genetic toolkit (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wilkins, 2013</a>). Furthermore, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, since both conserved and novel genes likely play roles in the evolution of all new traits (<a href=\"#bib29\">Johnson and Linksvayer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Woodard et al., 2011</a>)."

In this way, one question we can ask is whether we see any simple molecular signature of social evolution, for example due to kin selection? As <i>Monomorium</i> ant workers are obligately sterile, all worker traits are expected to be shaped exclusively by indirect selection (i.e., kin selection) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamilton, 1964</a>). All-else-equal, such indirect selection is weaker than direct selection, proportional to relatedness (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamilton, 1964</a>), and a priori is expected to produce relaxed selective constraint and elevated rates of molecular evolution for all genes associated with worker traits (<a href=\"#bib42\">Linksvayer and Wade, 2009</a>). Past studies have found different rates of molecular evolution for worker-biased and queen-biased genes, with most studies finding that worker-biased genes are more rapidly evolving (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ferreira et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Feldmeyer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Harpur et al., 2014</a>; but see; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hunt et al., 2010</a>). Some researchers have interpreted different patterns between lineages as being consistent with simple kin selection predictions based on differences in within-colony relatedness (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hall and Goodisman, 2012</a>), but most studies have emphasized the association between conditional expression and relaxed selection (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hunt et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2013</a>), as well as genes associated with worker traits simply experiencing stronger positive selection (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hunt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ferreira et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Feldmeyer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Harpur et al., 2014</a>). We observed weakly elevated rates of molecular evolution at nurse-upregulated genes compared to the rest of the genome, but much more notable was the distinct connectivity and corresponding differences in gene conservation for forager-upregulated genes relative to nurse-upregulated and non-differentially expressed genes. These results suggest that social evolution does not just have simple genome-wide effects such as relaxed effective selection associated with kin selection, but instead shapes complex social traits while acting within general systems-level constraints imposed by regulatory architecture."

For example, we expect that traits associated with social signal production (e.g., pheromone and glandular secretions) are often located peripherally within regulatory networks and as a result may be evolutionarily labile (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jasper et al., 2015</a>), as is the case more generally with secreted proteins (<a href=\"#bib32\">Julenius and Pedersen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Liao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Nogueira et al., 2012</a>). More core and conserved components are also certain to be important to the expression of these traits, but their contribution to trait evolution may be minimized by virtue of the fact that they are highly connected. These arguments suggest how both conserved, toolkit genes, as well as rapidly evolving and taxonomically restricted novel genes, likely play important roles in the evolution of social novelty, with novel genes being added peripherally to regulatory networks. Our results are consistent with this interpretation, because <i>M. pharaonis</i> age-based division of labor seems to have a complex genetic basis with some components that are highly connected and conserved, and other components that are more loosely connected and evolutionarily labile."

This result seems surprising given that foragers of different lineages experience diverse environments outside the nest compared to the relatively constant within-nest environment experienced by nurses and could be expected to experience more diverse selective pressures. One explanation is that the physiological mechanisms associated with metabolically costly foraging activities and older adult life (<i>M. pharaonis</i> workers usually only live several weeks [<a href=\"#bib52\">Peacock and Baxter, 1950</a>], so that foragers which start right before their second week of age may already be senescing) may be relatively conserved and simple. Nursing behavior, occurring during very early adult life, may involve more diverse physiological and developmental processes, and nursing itself may also involve more diverse behaviors and physiological processes, such as food processing and the synthesis of glandular secretions that are fed to larvae. Perhaps the relatively more complex genetic architecture (less tightly connected, involving more modules, and diverse processes) has served as less of a constraint and facilitated more evolutionary change for nurse-related genes. If so, we predict that nurse-specific functions and functions for early adult life may be generally more evolutionarily labile as well as more physiologically and behaviorally labile within and across lineages than forager-specific functions. Note that this prediction is opposite the typical expectation that genes acting early in development have more pleiotropic effects and are thus especially constrained (<a href=\"#bib60\">Roux and Robinson-Rechavi, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Piasecka et al., 2013</a>), but obligate sterility may, in part, release workers from these constraints on the evolution of genes acting early in worker development."

Interestingly, the modules differed in the proportion of constituent genes which had identifiable <i>S. invicta</i> and <i>A. mellifera</i> orthologs, indicating that modules vary in the degree to which they are composed of conserved genes and gene networks vs rapidly evolving genes with unknown function.

Building on the genetic toolkit conceptual framework, it will be possible to ask to what degree diverse lineages repeatedly use the same modules, and importantly approaches already exist for quantifying module overlap in the absence of functional information (<a href=\"#bib50\">Oldham et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Langfelder et al., 2011</a>). Similarly, after finding non-significant overlap in lists of genes associated with queen- and worker-caste development in paper wasps and honey bees, <a href=\"#bib8\">Berens et al.

We also set up a camera to automatically take images of the nest areas of each colony once every 20 min for the entire period of the study, although we do not further discuss these images."

We ran the study for 1 month, expecting to capture the major age-based transitions in worker behavior (e.g., the nursing to foraging transition observed in other species), but it is possible that we missed late behavioral transitions that occurred towards the end of workers' lives. In practice, such late transitions are difficult to detect as sample size necessarily declines as increasing numbers of workers die."

Each experimental colony contained four identifiable locations that were redefined prior to each behavioral scan: brood area, brood periphery, remaining nest area, and foraging area. The brood area was defined as the central area within the nest containing all brood and queens (<a href=\"#bib15\">Edwards, 1991</a>). The nest periphery was defined as the region directly adjacent to the brood area, where workers were dense in aggregation but not in contact with any of the brood. The nest area was defined as the sparsely occupied remainder of the space within the nest, not including the brood area and nest periphery. The foraging area included all areas outside of the nest.

In addition, for each of the two replicate observation colonies, we collected and pooled 20 non-paint marked workers in the act of the following five behaviors: nursing larvae, grooming larvae, engaged in trophallaxis with other workers, foraging for protein (collecting egg, mealworm, or liver), and foraging for carbohydrates (collecting honey solution).

In order to infer co-expression modules and gain an insight into network structure of gene interactions, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on the count data (<a href=\"#bib36\">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</a>). WGCNA was conducted on the entire transcript set, after filtering out the low-abundance transcripts. This analysis relies on patterns of gene co-expression, but has been shown to reconstruct protein\u2013protein interaction networks with reasonable accuracy (<a href=\"#bib83\">Zhao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2012</a>). We used total connectivity as a measure of gene interaction strength, because it is not as sensitive to module assignments, and most likely reflects the overall selective pressures acting on the gene, beyond those imposed by its role in age polyethism. As with most gene expression analysis, WGCNA provides better estimates for highly abundant genes, and in particular for genes showing variation in their expression levels. Consequently, low-abundance and invariant genes will show lower connectivity."

Or did a particular gene have to be differentially expressed in the same direction in both taxa? (The latter, I think, although this wasn't clear.) And did a gene need to be significantly differentially expressed to be counted? Or was it sufficient that it show the same directionality in expression, regardless of significance? Directionality without significance is as important as significance, given that the studies in the taxa had different power, used different methods, etc. These are not trivial issues and they may affect the outcome and interpretation of the results. I urge the authors to look into this more closely."

Similarly, a recent book chapter by Adam <a href=\"#bib78\">Wilkins (2013)</a> points out that the concept of a developmental genetic toolkit is widely accepted, but it is also very unclear what actually makes up the genetic toolkit, so that the hypothesis is very difficult to actually test. Because these two hypotheses are entrenched in the literature\u2014and the idea of a genetic toolkit underlying social behavior is frequently cited as <i>the</i> major finding of sociogenomic research\u2014we describe them in the Introduction to motivate our work. In the Discussion, we explain how our results fit with these two hypotheses, but then we move on to our main, and we believe, most exciting point: the genes we identified as being associated with ant division of labor show different patterns of connectivity and evolutionary conservation, and thus the genetic architecture of ant division of labor includes both highly connected and conserved genes as well as more loosely-connected and evolutionarily labile genes."

So, the results of the two analyses are consistent. This significant but seemingly low overlap is also consistent with previous studies interpreted as supporting the genetic toolkit hypothesis. For example, <a href=\"#bib81\">Woodard et al. (2014)</a> found 18 brain-expressed genes associated with feeding behavior in both the bumblebee <i>Bombus terrestris</i> and the paper wasp <i>Polistes metricus</i>, which was more than expected by chance.

For our measure of connectivity, we used the total connectivity of a gene, which is less sensitive to how modules are defined, and most likely reflect the overall role of the gene, beyond the modules we detect in our data set. Although the authors of the WGCNA package suggest that the method can run on normalized count data, in the course of considering potential biases, we found the gene lengths varied somewhat among behavioral categories. We then re-ran the analysis using FPKM data, which are length-standardized. This analysis also captured major network effects, but had a much better fit to the data. In particular, we had to use a smaller soft thresholding level before an approximately scale-free topology of the network was observed (a WGCNA requirement). We were also able to detect many more modules at the same cutoff levels, suggesting greater network resolution."

However, contrary to what you would expect if the pattern was driven by this bias, the nurse-upregulated genes show lower connectivity than non-differentially expressed genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).
