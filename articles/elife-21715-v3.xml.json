                    "text": "The spinal cord has the capacity to coordinate motor activities such as locomotion. Following spinal transection, functional activity can be regained, to a degree, following motor training. To identify microcircuits involved in this recovery, we studied a population of mouse spinal interneurons known to receive direct afferent inputs and project to intermediate and ventral regions of the spinal cord. We demonstrate that while dI3 interneurons are not necessary for normal locomotor activity, locomotor circuits rhythmically inhibit them and dI3 interneurons can activate these circuits. Removing dI3 interneurons from spinal microcircuits by eliminating their synaptic transmission left locomotion more or less unchanged, but abolished functional recovery, indicating that dI3 interneurons are a necessary cellular substrate for motor system plasticity following transection. We suggest that dI3 interneurons compare inputs from locomotor circuits with sensory afferent inputs to compute sensory prediction errors that then modify locomotor circuits to effect motor recovery."

Following spinal transection, functional activity can be regained, to a degree, following motor training. To identify microcircuits involved in this recovery, we studied a population of mouse spinal interneurons known to receive direct afferent inputs and project to intermediate and ventral regions of the spinal cord. We demonstrate that while dI3 interneurons are not necessary for normal locomotor activity, locomotor circuits rhythmically inhibit them and dI3 interneurons can activate these circuits. Removing dI3 interneurons from spinal microcircuits by eliminating their synaptic transmission left locomotion more or less unchanged, but abolished functional recovery, indicating that dI3 interneurons are a necessary cellular substrate for motor system plasticity following transection. We suggest that dI3 interneurons compare inputs from locomotor circuits with sensory afferent inputs to compute sensory prediction errors that then modify locomotor circuits to effect motor recovery."

Such plasticity has been demonstrated, for example, following spinal cord injury, when training can lead to a degree of recovery of spinal locomotor circuits such that stepping movements are restored (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barbeau et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Courtine et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Harkema et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hubli and Dietz, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Martinez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Takeoka et al., 2014</a>). After complete spinal transection in cats and rodents, a treadmill-training regimen that provides rhythmic sensory input to the spinal cord leads to the re-acquisition of the complex sequence of muscle activation that produces stepping (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barbeau and Rossignol, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">S\u0142awi\u0144ska et al., 2012</a>). Multiple modalities of sensory input are likely required to promote these sustained changes in spinal circuits, as removing cutaneous inputs degrades the quality of recovery in both cat (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bouyer and Rossignol, 2003</a>) and rats (<a href=\"#bib62\">S\u0142awi\u0144ska et al., 2012</a>), and eliminating muscle proprioceptive afferents impairs recovery in mice (<a href=\"#bib65\">Takeoka et al., 2014</a>). But in addition to determining the afferent inputs involved, it is necessary to identify the spinal circuits involved in this plasticity in order to understand how the nervous system acquires new motor skills in health and injury."

Furthermore, since there is a relationship between short-term adaptation and longer-term plasticity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bastian, 2008</a>), it might be useful to focus on interposed neurons that are known to be involved in adaptive responses. We previously showed that dI3 interneurons (INs), a population defined by expression of the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor <i>Isl1</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Liem et al., 1997</a>), receive multimodal monosynaptic sensory afferent inputs and project to spinal motoneurons. Eliminating glutamatergic output by these neurons led to deficits in motor responses to sensory perturbation: while the mice could place their paws on wire rungs, they were unable to adjust their grasp in response to sensory stimulation provided by increasing the inclination of the rungs. This indicates that a microcircuit involving dI3 INs mediates adaptive changes in motor behaviour (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bui et al., 2013</a>). We thus focussed on this population to determine if they have a role in locomotor recovery."

We demonstrate that while dI3 INs are not required for normal locomotor function, they are necessary for stable recovery of locomotor activity following spinal cord transection. Specifically, we demonstrate that eliminating glutamatergic output from dI3 INs precludes locomotor recovery after spinal cord transection. Thus, dI3 INs are involved in spinal microcircuits that mediate motor system plasticity."

To do so, we genetically eliminated glutamatergic neurotransmission from dI3 INs using dI3<sup>OFF</sup> (<i>Isl1</i><sup>Cre/+</sup>;<i>Slc17a6</i><sup>fl/fl</sup>) mice (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bui et al., 2013</a>). Within their cages, dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice did not reveal obvious locomotor deficits (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bui et al., 2013</a>). There was no difference between the weights of control (19.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3 g; n\u00a0=\u00a014) and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice (19.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7 g; n\u00a0=\u00a09, p&gt;0.44). Footprint and inter-limb coordination analysis revealed subtle alterations in locomotion in adults (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The hind paws, but not the forepaws, of dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice were more widely spaced than those of control mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice had a greater propensity to make coincident contact with the ground with three or four paws (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>, and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), however inter-limb coordination was similar in dI3<sup>OFF</sup> and control mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). During treadmill locomotion (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice had longer stance times on average, and a steeper relationship between stance duration and cycle period than seen in controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Collectively, the shorter swing phases, increased time with more paws in contact with the treadmill, and more widely spaced hind paws in dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice could result from a reduction in extensor activity and/or compensation for a reduction in stability. Taken together, these results show that while dI3 INs sculpt hind limb movement, they are not critical for the fundamental rhythm and/or pattern of locomotion."

Considering that sensory stimulation can trigger locomotor activity (<a href=\"#bib51\">Lundberg, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hultborn et al., 1998</a>) and that dI3 INs can be monosynaptically activated by stimulation of low-threshold sensory afferents (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bui et al., 2013</a>), we asked whether dI3 INs could activate spinal locomotor circuits. To do so, we studied sensory-evoked locomotion in control and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice, stimulating a sensory (sural) rather than a mixed (tibial) nerve to avoid stimulating motor axons. Furthermore, as sensory afferents may have multiple routes to spinal locomotor circuits, we stimulated the sural nerve, which we previously showed both anatomically and physiologically project directly to dI3 INs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bui et al., 2013</a>), rather than a dorsal root. We thus studied sensory-evoked locomotor activity in neonatal (P1-P3) mice by isolating their spinal cords with the sensory sural nerve in continuity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Given that the Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGluT2) coded by the gene <i>Slc17a6</i> is also expressed in high threshold small to medium sized primary afferents responsible for pain, itch, and thermoception (<a href=\"#bib13\">Brumovsky et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lagerstr\u00f6m et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Scherrer et al., 2010</a>), we focussed on low threshold stimulation, with threshold defined as the lowest amplitude that produced a volley in the proximal dorsal root (A-wave in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; control: 4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4 \u00b5A, <i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a013; dI3<sup>OFF</sup>: 2.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4 \u00b5A, <i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a012; p&gt;0.29)."

Furthermore, the thresholds required for evoking locomotor activity in these 6 dI3<sup>OFF</sup> spinal cords were significantly higher than control thresholds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>), with activity evoked only when stimulation was equal to or greater than the threshold for producing the higher threshold C-wave (in contrast to 5/6 controls that responded to low threshold stimulation, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,F</a>). In the dI3<sup>OFF</sup> spinal cords in which locomotor activity could be evoked, left-right alternation (control phase: 0.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11; dI3<sup>OFF</sup> phase: 0.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14; p&gt;0.15; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and locomotor frequency (control: 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 Hz; dI3<sup>OFF</sup>: 1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 Hz; p&gt;0.63; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) were similar to control spinal cords. The lack of response to low threshold stimulation in dI3<sup>OFF</sup> spinal cords was not due to sural nerve dysfunction, as low threshold sural nerve stimulation produced a normal volley in the dorsal root (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), nor was it due to a general inability of afferent stimulation to produce locomotor activity, as dorsal root stimulation was able to evoke locomotion in dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Thus dI3 IN output is necessary for low threshold-evoked locomotor activity, demonstrating that dI3 INs can activate spinal locomotor circuits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>)."

Raster and polar plots of up to 50 randomly selected action potentials from each of the 27 rhythmically active dI3 INs showed that the majority (22 of 27, 81%) of neurons were active primarily during the extensor phase of the step cycle (cf. 5/27 in flexor phase, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This extensor-dominant pattern of activity was seen irrespective of whether the interneurons were located in the upper or lower lumbar segments, or medial or lateral grey matter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Peak activity of those active during extension was at the midpoint of that phase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>). The dominant extensor phase activity may explain the differences in locomotion between control and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice, as elimination of dI3 IN output could result in reduced plantar flexion (physiological extension) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bui et al., 2013</a>) during paw ground contact (<a href=\"#bib27\">Engberg, 1964</a>), resulting in reduced weight support and rear track widening (<a href=\"#bib24\">Donelan et al., 2004</a>). Together, these data demonstrate that dI3 INs receive inputs \u2013 either directly or indirectly \u2013 from locomotor circuits, and are predominantly active during the ipsilateral extensor phase of the step cycle."

To do so, we isolated spinal cords from the brain by performing lower thoracic spinal cord transections in control (<i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a022), and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> (<i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a016) adult mice. Mice were subjected to regular treadmill training to promote spinal locomotor recovery (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We quantified forelimb/hindlimb step ratios as initial estimates of recovered hindlimb locomotor performance over time, counting any (however minimal) forward excursion of the toes as a \u2018step\u2019 (control: <i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a06; dI3<sup>OFF</sup>: <i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a03). Step ratios of animals from both groups plateaued by 50 days following transection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). But the number of forward toe excursions in dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice was about half that in control mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>, and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), indicating poor capacity of motor recovery by dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice following spinal transection."

The spinal-transected control animals had some recovery of locomotion, although limb movements were reduced compared to their intact counterparts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). On the other hand, dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice had minimal horizontal movements of distal hind limb segments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,G</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) and an almost complete absence of vertical excursions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>, and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Furthermore, while the kinematic parameters of spinal-transected control animals for the most part were a scaled version of those in intact animals, the parameters in dI3<sup>OFF</sup> animals differed in trajectory (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2E\u2013I</a>). For example, the knee angle linearly decreased during flexion (when it is normally biphasic) and linearly increased during extension (when it is normally primarily decreasing, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). That is, while control mice recovered a degree of the complex sequence of muscle activation that produces stepping, the minimal movements of dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice had linear kinematics with no resemblance to locomotion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>). Furthermore, during unrestrained overground locomotion (data not shown), there was almost a complete absence of hindlimb movement in dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice, in stark contrast to control mice, suggesting that the minimal movements seen during treadmill walking in dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice were specific to the treadmill environment."

They are positioned between multimodal sensory inputs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bui et al., 2013</a>) and spinal locomotor circuits, and have a bi-directional relationship with these locomotor circuits, receiving an efference copy of their activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We showed previously that elimination of dI3 INs from spinal microcircuits via genetically eliminating their glutamatergic output results in the abolition of short term motor adaptation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bui et al., 2013</a>), and now demonstrate that this mutation also results in the loss of plasticity required for locomotor recovery. Together, we suggest that dI3 INs function to integrate sensory input with motor commands in order to drive motor plasticity at level of\u00a0the spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

It is unlikely that this recovery results simply from a loss of afferent input to locomotor circuits, as sensory stimulation \u2013 either by increasing stimulation intensity or by number of fibres (by dorsal root stimulation) \u2013 can still evoke locomotor activity in dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mouse spinal cords. We thus suggest that dI3 INs are mediating plastic changes in these circuits. In other words, the re-acquisition of locomotion can be considered to be a low level form of motor learning, in which repeated activity leads to sustained changes in the central nervous system such that spinal circuits below the site of a lesion can produce locomotor activity in the absence of descending motor commands. In this light, it is therefore instructive to consider that circuits that mediate short-term adaptation are those that lead to long-term learning through various mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hirano et al., 2016</a>). We have previously shown that dI3 INs mediate short-term adaptation in regulating paw grasp in response to changing sensory stimulation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bui et al., 2013</a>). Long-term changes, however, must be accompanied by homeostatic plastic mechanisms that prevent instability induced by positive feedback (<a href=\"#bib67\">Turrigiano, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Desai, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Quartarone and Hallett, 2013</a>). These mechanisms could include, for example, changes in connectivity, synaptic strength, and/or morphology of spinal neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brownstone et al., 2015</a>). Such changes have been proposed to underlie spontaneous or training-induced changes in motor output in spinal cord injury patients (<a href=\"#bib35\">Harkema, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Knikou, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dietz, 2012</a>) and in animal models of spinal cord injury (<a href=\"#bib17\">C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Gossard, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Frigon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tillakaratne et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Martin, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">van den Brand et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Houle and C\u00f4t\u00e9, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Takeoka et al., 2014</a>). Similar mechanisms of plasticity may also occur during learning in intact developing and mature spinal cords (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tahayori and Koceja, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Grau, 2014</a>). Studying such changes at synapses between dI3 INs and their target locomotor circuit neurons may reveal specific mechanisms underlying this plasticity."

Predictive inputs arise from forward models derived from a copy of the motor command \u2013 an efference copy. By comparing these two inputs, comparator neurons calculate the \u2018sensory prediction error,\u2019 which is then used to modify circuit function, either for corrective responses or sustained learning (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shadmehr et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Requarth and Sawtell, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Brownstone et al., 2015</a>). Most dI3 INs receive excitatory instructive inputs from a variety of sensory afferents (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bui et al., 2013</a>), as well as inhibitory rhythmic input from locomotor circuits. We suggest that this inhibitory input, which mirrors the motor output, is the manifestation of a forward model and is suggestive of a negative image of the expected excitatory sensory input (<a href=\"#bib57\">Requarth and Sawtell, 2014</a>). That is, in addition to instructive inputs, dI3 INs receive inputs indicative of a predictive forward model. These two classes of inputs position dI3 INs as comparators between actual and predicted movement, and thus calculators of sensory prediction error. We suggest that this error signal leads to plastic changes in locomotor circuits, mediating long-term learning such as that necessary for locomotor recovery after spinal cord transection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

Therefore, functional removal of dI3 INs from the circuits results in the loss of sensory prediction error signals, and thus prevents the benefit of locomotor training following spinal transection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

We show that dI3 INs form an intra-spinal closed loop circuit, in which the microcircuits that route sensory information to locomotor circuits are themselves under the influence of the locomotor circuits that they modulate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These closed loops would be nested within other control loops, such as peripheral sensorimotor loops (<a href=\"#bib23\">Dimitriou and Edin, 2010</a>) and those situated between spinal motor circuits and descending motor systems (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arshavsky et al., 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hantman and Jessell, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Azim et al., 2014</a>). Together, these nested loops create a hierarchical control system that would optimise motor learning (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kawato et al., 1987</a>). That one of these loops may exist in the spinal cord would be important for rehabilitative techniques: targeting intraspinal learning circuits such as those formed by dI3 INs could lead to new strategies to facilitate spinal circuit function in order to improve motor behaviour affected by a number of neurological diseases and injuries."

Following anaesthesia with xylazine and ketamine, mice were decapitated. Their spinal cords were isolated by vertebrectomy in room temperature recording ACSF (in mM: NaCl, 127; KCl, 3; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 26; D-glucose, 10). Ventral and dorsal roots were dissected as distally as possible, and spinal cords were pinned with the ventral side up. A surgical blade was used to make a longitudinal incision down the midline (in a rostro-caudal direction). The hemicords were then allowed to equilibrate in room temperature recording ACSF for at least one hour, then pinned, medial-side up to a base of clear Sylgard (Dow Corning) in a recording chamber and perfused with circulating room temperature recording ACSF. Ventral roots were placed in suction electrodes (A-M Systems Inc.). In a subset of experiments examining the activity of dI3 INs during drug-evoked locomotion, bilateral dorsal cords were removed from segments L1 to L3 or from segments L4 to L6. Spinal cords were pinned on their sides and insect pins were used to trace a line followed by a surgical blade to section the spinal cord."

Polar plots of rhythmic activity were used for analysis of the rhythmic activity of each cell. The angle represents the mean phase (\u03a6) whereas the distance from origin is a measure of concentration around the mean phase, which we refer to here as <i>r</i>. After calculating the cosine and sine of the phase of each spike, \u03a6 was calculated as the average cosine and sine of the spikes and the angular concentration, <i>r</i>, was calculated as the square root of the sum of squares of the average cosine and average sine (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zar, 1996</a>). Thus if the neuron fires once per cycle at precisely the same phase, then <i>r</i>\u00a0=\u00a01. Conversely, if there were a random distribution of firing across the step cycle, then the average sine and cosine would both be 0, and <i>r</i>\u00a0=\u00a00 (i.e. all spikes are uniformly dispersed across the step cycle). The inner circle represents an <i>r</i> value of 0.24, as for 50 randomly-selected spikes, values above this threshold indicate that cells were rhythmically active (p&lt;0.05)."

This work is based on elegant mouse genetic experiments to visualize these neurons through their specific transcription factor expression and on the results of genetic ablation of dI3 cells. Using kinematic analysis of locomotion, motor behavioral tests and electrophysiological measurements, Bui et al. show that dI3 cells receive a direct sensory input from hindlimbs and play a moderate role in normal locomotion. The function of dI3 cells becomes much more prominent after complete transection of the spinal cord: thus, despite regular treadmill training, dI3OFF mice show gross impairment in regaining motor behavior. The authors explain their findings by assigning a key role of the dI3 INs in a learning spinal circuit suggesting that dI3 neurons are important during the critical phase of network plasticity that ensures the quality and extent of recovery after injury. This work is of general interest. The results have translational value to the human condition and deal with the thorny issue of recovery after injury and the relative contribution of neurorehabilitation. While the authors' work is of high quality, innovative and well illustrated there are points that should be resolved to improve the presentation and discuss alternative explanations for the rehabilitation."

Rossignol, for example, has provided evidence of locomotor circuit plasticity (\u201clearning\u201d) following hemisection. Learning involves the acquisition of a skill (for example) by training, and we would argue that this is what is happening following spinalisation, whether in the cat or the mouse or any other animal. We don\u2019t know the mechanism by which training leads to \u201cre-emergence\u201d (?) of the activity of locomotor circuits. (Is it LTP? synaptic scaling? Etc.), but raise possibilities."

Thus, to interpret their results the authors claim to adopt \"cerebellar models of motor learning\" (subsection \u201cPossible mechanisms underlying dI3 IN -mediated plasticity\u201d, first paragraph) that are then expanded to \"comparator neurons calculate the sensory prediction error\" and to electric organ discharge of mormyrid fish (second paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). The Discussion should be cut down substantially and avoid excessive speculations that are not close to the actual data. When implementing these changes the authors should address the alternative explanations to the learning (see above).</i> "

Therefore, while we have substantially reduced the amount of text devoted to this discussion, we think it still of value to bring up this concept."

While the authors have done a lot of electrophysiological measurements, it is not clear if there are any discernible alterations in neuronal/glial composition of the genetic model. This information is not apparent even in the earlier publication (Neuron 2013) by the same group. Of course, while reflexes and network activities may rely on the actual operation of a limited number of circuit components, after transection even an apparently modest histological change may have profound consequences on function. Some discussion of this issue is needed.</i> "
