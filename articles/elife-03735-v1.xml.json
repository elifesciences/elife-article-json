One hypothesis is that frequent codons are translated relatively rapidly.  However, there is little direct, in vivo evidence regarding codon-specific translation rates.  Here, we generate high-coverage data using ribosome profiling in yeast, analyze using a novel algorithm, and deduce events at the A and P-sites of the ribosome.  Different codons are decoded at different rates in the A-site.  In general frequent codons are decoded more quickly than rare codons, and AT-rich codons are decoded more quickly than GC-rich codons.  At the P-site, proline is slow in forming peptide bonds.  We also apply our algorithm to short footprints from a different conformation of the ribosome, and find strong, amino-acid specific (not codon-specific) effects that may reflect interactions with the exit tunnel of the ribosome."
