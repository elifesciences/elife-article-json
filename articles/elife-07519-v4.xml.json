We found that they interact to promote centriole duplication and form a hierarchy in which each is required to localize another to the centrosome, with CDK5RAP2 at the apex, and CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 at sequentially lower positions. MCPH proteins interact with distinct centriolar satellite proteins; CDK5RAP2 interacts with SPAG5 and CEP72, CEP152 with CEP131, WDR62 with MOONRAKER, and CEP63 with CEP90 and CCDC14. These satellite proteins localize their cognate MCPH interactors to centrosomes and also promote centriole duplication. Consistent with a role for satellites in microcephaly, homozygous mutations in one satellite gene, <i>CEP90</i>, may cause MCPH. The satellite proteins, with the exception of CCDC14, and MCPH proteins promote centriole duplication by recruiting CDK2 to the centrosome. Thus, centriolar satellites build a MCPH complex critical for human neurodevelopment that promotes CDK2 centrosomal localization and centriole duplication."

We found that they interact to promote centriole duplication and form a hierarchy in which each is required to localize another to the centrosome, with CDK5RAP2 at the apex, and CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 at sequentially lower positions. MCPH proteins interact with distinct centriolar satellite proteins; CDK5RAP2 interacts with SPAG5 and CEP72, CEP152 with CEP131, WDR62 with MOONRAKER, and CEP63 with CEP90 and CCDC14. These satellite proteins localize their cognate MCPH interactors to centrosomes and also promote centriole duplication. Consistent with a role for satellites in microcephaly, homozygous mutations in one satellite gene, <i>CEP90</i>, may cause MCPH. The satellite proteins, with the exception of CCDC14, and MCPH proteins promote centriole duplication by recruiting CDK2 to the centrosome. Thus, centriolar satellites build a MCPH complex critical for human neurodevelopment that promotes CDK2 centrosomal localization and centriole duplication."

The microcephaly-associated proteins congregate at the centrosome in a particular order, with each protein recruiting the next one in the sequence.

Many of the genes mutated in MCPH encode centrosomal proteins (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bond et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zhong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kumar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Guernsey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nicholas et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sir et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lin et al., 2013</a>). The association of MCPH proteins with the centrosome is evolutionarily conserved with <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Delattre et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Strnad and Gonczy, 2008</a>). Three MCPH proteins, CEP152, CEP135 and STIL, interact with and promote the centrosomal localization of SAS4 (also known as CPAP or CENPJ) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Strnad and Gonczy, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cizmecioglu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dzhindzhev et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sir et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brown et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lin et al., 2013</a>). Failure to recruit SAS4 can attenuate centriole elongation and duplication (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schmidt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Comartin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lin et al., 2013</a>). Together, these observations have raised the possibility that CEP152, CEP135 and STIL promote the recruitment of proteins to the centrosome to facilitate centriole duplication. However, how these MCPH-associated proteins localize to the centrosome and how they promote centriole duplication have remained largely elusive."

Whether and, if so, how these proteins function together are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that these MCPH-associated proteins biochemically interact and cooperate in a shared mechanism of centriole biogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we identified interactors of each MCPH-associated protein and found that the MCPH proteins CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 physically associate with each other. Moreover, they form a hierarchy in which each is required to localize another to the centrosome, and that this stepwise assembly at the centrosome is essential to promote centriole duplication."

Their associated centriolar satellite partners are required for the localization of the interacting MCPH-associated protein to the centrosome. Consistent with a role in building the MCPH protein complex at the centrosome, centriolar satellites, like their MCPH-associated proteins, are necessary for centriole duplication to occur efficiently. Thus, paralleling the hierarchy of MCPH-associated proteins, there is a hierarchy of satellite proteins, each of which participates in the centriolar localization of an MCPH-associated protein. We found that a homozygous, missense mutation affecting one of these centriolar satellite components, <i>CEP90</i>, is associated with microcephaly, further validating the functional connection between centriolar satellites and the function of the previously defined MCPH-associated proteins."

We found that both the MCPH-associated proteins and their centriolar satellite partner proteins are required for the centrosomal localization of CDK2, a cyclin-dependent kinase with established roles in both cell cycle progression and centriole duplication (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hinchcliffe et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Meraldi et al., 1999</a>). Thus, MCPH-associated proteins and centriolar satellites cooperate to ensure the stepwise recruitment to the centrosome of additional MCPH-assocated proteins, culminating in bringing CDK2 to the centrosome and duplicating the centrioles."

While we detected a number of interacting proteins, we focused our study on proteins previously reported to localize to the centrosome and implicated in centriole duplication. Specifically, we used the data from Jakobsen et al. and Balestra et al. to identify likely centrosomal proteins and those required for centriole biogenesis, respectively (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jakobsen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Balestra et al., 2013</a>).

After brief treatment with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules, PCM1 forms large cytoplasmic aggregates together with satellite cargo proteins (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</a>). Like satellite cargo proteins, microtubule depolymerization caused a portion of CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 to relocalize to PCM1 aggregates (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). In contrast, \u03b3-tubulin did not accumulate at the nocodazole-induced PCM1 aggregates, suggesting that not all centrosomal proteins move from centriolar satellites to the centrosome in a microtubule-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). The accumulation of four MCPH-associated proteins in PCM1 aggregates upon nocodazole treatment raised the possibility that they are cargoes that centriolar satellites help transport to the centrosome.

We also found that the protein levels of CDK5RAP2 were reduced in <i>CEP72</i> and <i>SPAG5-</i>depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Interestingly, in addition to destabilizing CDK5RAP2, the stability of CEP72 and SPAG5 was reduced in <i>SPAG5</i> and <i>CEP72</i>-depleted cells, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). As in HeLa cells, CEP72 and SPAG5 were essential for stabilizing CDK5RAP2 and localizing it to the centrosome in U2OS cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>).

He exhibits spasticity especially in the lower extremities with scissoring and Achilles contractures, hyperreflexia, ankle clonus and a positive Babinksi sign. He suffers from severe intellectual disability and does not speak.

Together, these findings demonstrate that CCDC14 suppresses the formation of supernumerary Centrin foci by limiting the centrosomal localization of CEP63 and the activity of its binding partner CDK2."

Therefore, the centriolar satellite proteins, like the MCPH proteins, have critical roles in promoting centriole duplication.

In <i>C. elegans,</i> centriole duplication is coordinated by SPD-2 (CEP192) recruitment of ZYG-1 (PLK4) which, in turn, localizes SAS-5 (STIL) and SAS-6 to the centrosome, culminating in the recruitment of SAS-4 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Delattre et al., 2006</a>). Our results indicate that ordered recruitment of MCPH-associated proteins to the centrosome extends beyond CDK5RAP2 and CEP152 to include WDR62 and CEP63. Moreover, the recruitment of centriole duplication proteins to the centrosome occurs in a step-wise fashion, with CDK5RAP2 being required for the recruitment of CEP152, which recruits WDR62, which in turn recruits CEP63 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>)."

By bringing MCPH-associated proteins to the centrosome, the centriolar satellite proteins are required to localize proteins to the centrosome even when no biochemical interaction was detected. For example, CEP72 and SPAG5 are required for all four MCPH-assocated proteins to localize to the centrosome, but they interact specifically with CDK5RAP2. While it is possible that the satellite proteins assemble the MCPH protein complex in the cytoplasm prior to its delivery to the centrosome, the most parsimonious model to explain these results is that centriolar satellite proteins bring individual interacting MCPH-associated proteins to the centrosome where the MCPH complex is assembled, and that this recruitment and assembly is required for the subsequent localization of other MCPH-associated proteins farther down the hierarchy. To extend our example, by bringing CDK5RAP2 to the centrosome, the centriolar satellite proteins CEP72 and SPAG5 are required for the centrosomal localization of the other three MCPH proteins despite not interacting with them biochemically. Thus, the centriolar satellite proteins form a hierarchy that parallels the MCPH protein hierarchy, with distinct satellite components interacting with and being required for the centrosomal localization of different MCPH-associated proteins."

These findings suggest that centriolar satellite proteins may bind their cognate MCPH-associated protein outside of the centrosome and deliver it to the centrosome where it can complex with other MCPH-associated proteins. Previous studies revealed that centriolar satellites transport cargo along microtubules in a dynein-dynactin dependent manner to deliver proteins to the centrosome (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kubo et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kodani et al., 2010</a>). Our finding that MCPH-associated proteins colocalize with the centriolar satellite protein PCM1 upon acute depolymerization of microtubules provides further evidence that the function of centriolar satellites is to transport proteins to the centrosome in a microtubule-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kodani et al., 2010</a>).

Therefore, we propose that hypomorphic mutations in <i>CEP90</i> are a rare cause of human microcephaly, and that defects in the function of centriolar satellites can cause the human disease microcephaly. It will be interesting to determine whether mutations in genes encoding other centriolar satellite components are also causes of microcephaly."

Following fixation; cells were incubated in blocking buffer (2.5% BSA, 0.1% Triton-X100, 0.03% NaN<sub>3</sub> in DPBS) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with cells at room temperature for 1 hr. To detect CDK2 using anti-CDK2 (M2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cells were extracted with 0.1% Triton X-100 in a buffer consisting of 50 mM piperazine-1, 4-bis (2-ethanesulphonic acid) at pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM EDTA prior to fixation in chilled methanol for 3 min. Alternatively, cells were fixed in ice cold methanol:acetone (1:1) for 7 min to detect CDK2 using anti-CDK2 (22060-1-AP, Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL). Coverslips were mounted using Gelvatol mounting media and imaged with an inverted Axio Observer D1 (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY), image processing was completed with Adobe Photoshop. For fluorescence quantifications, specified sized regions of interest were selected and quantified using Fiji. The signal of the MCPH proteins were normalized to Centrin signal in HeLa or U2OS cells."

The paper is descriptive and functional studies are at the level of dependence of one protein for the localization of another. In spite of the title there is no data showing that satellites bring microcephaly proteins to centrosomes. The paper is difficult to read and will be a challenge for anyone not directly involved in this field. Perhaps a model or diagram would help to graphically illustrate the data."

However, they failed to show any insightful mechanisms accounting for the recruitment and function. More specifically, the authors failed to provide direct evidence to support that SPAG5, CEP72, CEP131, MNR, and CEP90 participate in centriole duplication through interaction with MCPH proteins. The binding sites essential for these interactions could be mapped and the binding deficient mutants should be expressed in cells with knockdown background to test whether the interactions are the main reason for the phenotype."

However, depletion of CDK5RAP2 (also known as Cep215) by RNAi has been used in previous studies, but centriole duplication defects were not been described. Rather CDK5RAP2 seems to have a role in regulating centrosome cohesion and centriole engagement. To support their finding, the authors should perform depletion experiments with siRNA and cells used in previous studies to see whether they can reproduce the duplication defect. This could also be used to confirm the dependency of Cep152 on CDK5RAP2. The same applies to Cep63 depletion. In <a href=\"#bib5\">Brown et al., 2013</a>, and <a href=\"#bib56\">Sir et al., 2011</a>, CEP63 was shown to be required for CEP152 localization to the centrosomes in different cell types, in conditions of genomic deletion but also RNAi."

In the current manuscript CEP63 depletion does not seem to affect CEP152. The argument in the discussion that acute vs. prolonged treatment may explain discrepancies with previous work is not valid, since acute depletion was also used in some of the previously published experiments. It is important that the authors rigorously address issues regarding previously published, conflicting data. The authors should test siRNA and cells that were previously tested."

Is there indeed more protein co-localizing with PCM1 or is this just due to increased exposure/brightness settings?

If centrosomes are not present during the IPs then the data clearly shows that all 4 MCPH proteins interact in the cytosol, and that the formation of this large complex depends on the sequential recruitment of each MCPH protein by its satellite partner. CDK5RAP2 could be considered the platform onto which all others sequentially and hierarchically assemble. And all of this can occur in the cytosol, in the absence of centrosomes. Obviously this will result in a hierarchical centrosome localization effect, as a result of changes in the pre-assembled cytosolic complexes. Unless you can exclude this possibility, the description and discussion of the recruitment data (and thus the model) needs to be changed."

While we would have liked to confirm the experiments from Sir et al., Dhamacon has discontinued the SMARTpool siRNA product referred to in their Nature Genetics paper, and was unable to tell us the siRNA sequences. We found that depletion of CEP63 using the siRNA that they call <i>CEP63 NB</i> disrupted centriole duplication, centrosomes failed to accumulate CDK5RAP2, CEP152, and WDR62, in accordance with what they reported and in contrast to our findings using other ways of depleting CEP63. Examining protein levels revealed that the <i>CEP63 NB</i> siRNA depleted endogenous CEP63 protein levels and also led to the co-depletion of CDK5RAP2, CEP152, and WDR62, again in contrast to our findings using other ways of depleting CEP63. The independent siRNAs <i>CEP63 #1</i> and <i>#2</i> deplete endogenous CEP63 to an equivalent degree but do not cause the co-depletion of these other proteins<i>.</i> Throughout this work, we have been careful to report only phenotypes that are caused by siRNAs that both efficiently deplete the target protein, and show phenotypes that are caused by multiple independent siRNAs. While our model would predict that destabilization of CDK5RAP2, as occurs upon knockdown with <i>CEP63 NB</i>, will cause a failure to recruit CEP152 to the centrosome, we are hesitant to make this conclusion as it is only observed with the use of this siRNA.

The difference is attributable to the properties of SIM. The low contrast staining of CDK5RAP2 outside of the toroidal structure at the center of the centrosome creates a situation for SIM very similar to the in-focus image surrounded by out-of-focus light. In the resulting point spread function, the data from the neighboring fluorophores outnumbers the data from the central fluorophore and the SIM algorithm\u2019s high-pass filters cannot assign the data from these fluorophores in reciprocal space to coordinates based on where the light originated from. Thus, low contrast images are not distinguishable from noise even with the use of different Wiener filter values in SIM. This is a known limitation of the use of SIM with low contrast samples. SIM is more appropriate use with high contrast, structured images. Thus, we have limited our use of SIM to imaging the region of CDK5RAP2 at the toroidal structure which, unlike the surrounding CDK5RAP2 domain, is both high contrast and highly structured.
