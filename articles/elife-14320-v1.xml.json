The mechanisms underlying this perceptual organization process are only partially understood. We here investigate the time-course of perceptual grouping of two-dimensional image-regions by measuring the reaction times of human participants and report that it is associated with the gradual spread of object-based attention. Attention spreads fastest over large and homogeneous areas and is slowed down at locations that require small-scale processing. We find that the time-course of the object-based selection process is well explained by a 'growth-cone' model, which selects surface elements in an incremental, scale-dependent manner. We discuss how the visual cortical hierarchy can implement this scale-dependent spread of object-based attention, leveraging the different receptive field sizes in distinct cortical areas."

The mechanisms underlying this perceptual organization process are only partially understood. We here investigate the time-course of perceptual grouping of two-dimensional image-regions by measuring the reaction times of human participants and report that it is associated with the gradual spread of object-based attention. Attention spreads fastest over large and homogeneous areas and is slowed down at locations that require small-scale processing. We find that the time-course of the object-based selection process is well explained by a 'growth-cone' model, which selects surface elements in an incremental, scale-dependent manner. We discuss how the visual cortical hierarchy can implement this scale-dependent spread of object-based attention, leveraging the different receptive field sizes in distinct cortical areas."

Instead, cells at early stages of the visual system respond selectively to single features of the object, such as edges. Moreover, each cell responds to its target feature in only a small region of space known as its receptive field. At higher levels of the visual system, cells respond to more complex features: angles rather than edges, for example. The receptive fields of the cells are also larger. For us to see an object, the brain must therefore 'stitch' together diverse features into a unified impression."

If an image region is narrow, the visual system must recruit cells with small receptive fields to process the individual features. Grouping will therefore be slow. By contrast, if the object consists of large uniform areas lacking in detail, grouping should be fast. These assumptions give rise to a model called the \u201cgrowth-conemodel\u201d, which makes a number of specific predictions about reaction times during perceptual grouping."

Such a rapid grouping process would be in line with studies demonstrating that object recognition can be extremely fast and pre-attentive (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thorpe et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Moore and Egeth, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Treisman, 1985</a>). High-speed object recognition presumably relies on feedforward processing, leveraging the hierarchy of features represented in the visual cortex. Neurons in lower areas coding for elementary features rapidly propagate activity to shape selective neurons in higher visual areas (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hung\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">DiCarlo et al., 2012</a>), grouping features into more complex constellations (<a href=\"#bib52\">Roelfsema, 2006</a>) so that perceptual grouping coincides with object recognition (<a href=\"#bib1\">Biederman et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Nakayama et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Driver and Baylis, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pelli et al., 2009</a>).

In the example display of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a> subjects judge if the two colored circles fall on the same curve. In this task, reaction times increase linearly with the length of the curve. Subjects first direct their attention to the red fixation point and attention then gradually spreads over the curve until it reaches the green circle (<a href=\"#bib54\">Scholte et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Houtkamp et al., 2003</a>). This process is implemented in the visual cortex as the propagation of enhanced neuronal activity over the curve\u2019s representation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pooresmaeili and Roelfsema, 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). Curve-tracing is size invariant (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jolicoeur and Ingleton, 1991</a>) so that the reaction time of observers depends little on the viewing distance. This is remarkable, because the length of the curve in degrees of visual angle increases when subjects view the stimulus from nearby. However, now the distance between the curves also increases and this enhances tracing speed (in degree/s) compensates for the longer curves so that the total reaction time remains the same. Size invariance can be explained if perceptual grouping occurs at multiple levels of the visual cortical hierarchy (<a href=\"#bib49\">Roelfsema and Houtkamp, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pooresmaeili and Roelfsema, 2014</a>). When curves are nearby, perceptual grouping requires the high spatial resolution provided by low-level areas where neurons have small receptive fields (RFs) and horizontal connections interconnect neurons with RFs that are nearby in visual space so that progress is slow. If curves are farther apart, however, neurons in higher areas can take over and their larger RFs could speed up the grouping process (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pooresmaeili and Roelfsema, 2014</a>). Size invariance also occurs when subjects solve a maze, because paths are followed at a higher speed if the distance between the walls is larger (<a href=\"#bib2\">Crowe et al., 2000</a>)."

These authors suggested that image regions with homogenous surface properties are grouped instantaneously (<a href=\"#bib39\">Palmer and Rock, 1994</a>) so that the reaction time should not depend on the placement of cues within a white region enclosed by a black contour (as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). The second model has been called 'pixel-by-pixel' in the context of curve-tracing (<a href=\"#bib33\">McCormick and Jolicoeur, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jolicoeur and Ingleton, 1991</a>). Grouping is realized by spreading attention across pixels of the same color, at a fixed speed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). Spreading starts at one of the cues and processing time is proportional to the length of the shortest path through the object. At a neuronal level, enhanced activity could spread among neurons tuned to the same color, at a single spatial scale (<a href=\"#bib11\">Grossberg and Mingolla, 1985</a>). The third model is the growth-cone model (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>), inspired by models for curve tracing (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pooresmaeili and Roelfsema, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">McCormick and Jolicoeur, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jolicoeur et al., 1986</a>) and visual routines (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ullman, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Roelfsema et al., 2000</a>). The growth-cone model predicts that grouping speed depends on the size of homogeneous image regions. Spreading is fast within large regions and slows down in narrow regions. In our implementation, we determined for every pixel the size of the largest circle centered at that pixel that did not touch the boundaries and assumed that speed was proportional to this size. This model is scale invariant because the total spreading time does not depend on variations in the overall size of the picture, caused e.g. by changes in viewing distance. In the visual cortex, this model could be implemented if neurons with various receptive field (RF) sizes tuned to the same feature spread the enhanced activity. In large, homogenous image regions, neurons with large RFs would make fast progress, but in narrow regions grouping speed decreases because neurons with small RFs take over. The fourth model is one where the grouping signal spreads inwards from the boundaries of the cued object so that the response time increases with the distance between the cue and the boundary (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Komatsu, 2006</a>). Such a 'filling-in' process has been proposed for brightness perception (<a href=\"#bib40\">Paradiso and Nakayama, 1991</a>) and texture segregation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lamme et al., 1999</a>). The fifth and final model is a Euclidean model, which will serve as reference because it is simple. It holds that the reaction time depends on the distance between cues, irrespective of the shape of the objects (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). It differs from the pixel-by-pixel model where distance is measured as the shortest path within the object."

In Experiment 1A the second cue was at a fixed distance from the fixation point. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a> illustrates the model predictions. The filling-in model predicts short RTs for cues near the edges and long RTs in the center. The uniform connectedness model, the Euclidean model, and the pixel-by-pixel model predict that RTs are constant, because all cues are at the same distance from fixation. In contrast, the growth-cone model predicts that RTs are short in the center and longer near the edges."

A growth-cone model where the speed of the grouping operation depends on the size of homogeneous image regions best describes the results. At first sight, such a slow, serial grouping process seems to be at odds with previous findings that some forms of perceptual grouping, related to the recognition of objects or image categories like animals and vehicles, is very rapid and pre-attentive (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thorpe et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kirchner and Thorpe, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Moore and Egeth, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Treisman, 1985</a>). The pre-attentive formation of perceptual groupings appears to rely on rapid feedforward computations that take place when visual information propagates from early to higher visual areas (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yamins\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</a>), a strategy that is also used by state-of-the-art convolutional networks for object recognition (<a href=\"#bib55\">Szegedy et al., 2015</a>). However, the recognition of objects in the scene does not imply that visual segmentation processes have completed (<a href=\"#bib8\">Epshtein et\u00a0al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Houtkamp and Roelfsema, 2010</a>). For example, connectedness is one of the cues for perceptual grouping, and it is difficult to compute connectedness in a purely feedforward manner (<a href=\"#bib34\">Minsky and Papert, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Roelfsema et al., 1999</a>). Furthermore, if a scene contains multiple animals, the recognition of the species does not imply that all parts of every animal have been grouped as coherent percepts (<a href=\"#bib27\">Korjoukov et al., 2012</a>) because there are also cases where recognition precedes image parsing (<a href=\"#bib59\">Vecera and Farah, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Peterson et al., 1991</a>). Experiments 1 and 2 specifically probed this grouping process, asking participants to report whether cues fell on parts of the same object, and we obtained unequivocal evidence for a serial grouping operation. Our results suggest that the visual system processes simple 2D image regions as miniature mazes, and for mazes serial processing is less surprising (<a href=\"#bib2\">Crowe et al., 2000</a>)."

In the visual cortex, the spread of attention is associated with the propagation of enhanced neuronal activity over the representation of the relevant curve (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pooresmaeili and Roelfsema, 2014</a>). Spreading is fast if curves are far apart but it slows down if curves are in each other\u2019s vicinity. The curve-tracing operation has also been modeled as a growth-cone process, similar to the one we now used to model grouping of 2D image regions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pooresmaeili and Roelfsema, 2014</a>). In daily life, this serial grouping operation may only be necessary for specific tasks. During object recognition, image parsing may be unnecessary, but during grasping one needs to determine whether surfaces belong to the same object to avoid placing fingers on surfaces of different ones."

In these areas the horizontal connections, responsible for the spread of enhanced activity, link neurons that represent nearby locations in visual space. If the homogeneous image regions are larger, the propagation may take place in higher areas with larger RFs so that the grouping speed is higher (red in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

Higher cortical areas with large receptive fields make great strides in the propagation of enhanced neuronal activity and this fast progress also impacts on lower areas through feedback connections (downward pointing arrows).

Indeed, it is well known that the size of receptive fields increases with eccentricity. Suppose that the task is to group an elongated bar with a width of 2\u00b0 (as in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). The propagation of enhanced neuronal activity would take place in area V1 for the more eccentric parts of the bar (e.g. at 10\u00b0 eccentricity) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gattass et al., 1981</a>) but area V4 would make fastest progress where the bar is nearer to the fovea (e.g. at 2\u00b0 eccentricity) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gattass et al., 1988</a>). The horizontal distance between neurons with abutting, non-overlapping RFs is relatively constant across visual areas (<a href=\"#bib13\">Harvey and Dumoulin, 2011</a>). Thus, if we assume that the propagation of enhanced neuronal activity through horizontal connections is also similar, it follows that the propagation speed (in \u00b0/s or growth-cones/s) should also be constant across eccentricities for a bar with a constant width. The growth-cone mechanism is therefore compatible with the fact that the receptive field size in visual cortical areas increases with eccentricity."

The interior contours in the tails form closed, disconnected compartments that cannot be grouped by the growth-cone model. The overall influence of the interior contours is difficult to predict, however. On the one hand, they might slow down parsing by presenting barriers. On the other hand, they might facilitate object recognition and thereby speed up the grouping. Hence, the interior contours, the influence of color and texture, as well as the influence of object-recognition go beyond the simple models considered by us so that variance had to remain unexplained."

It would therefore be of interest to generalize the growth-cone model to account for perceptual grouping of objects with interior contours, colors, and textures. We expect that these generalizations necessitate a mechanism for object recognition. In the picture of the lemur (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c,d</a>), for example, we see that the left tail belongs to the right lemur, because we know what a lemur looks like. Segmentation based on the characteristic shape of objects is known as 'semantic segmentation'. Models of segmentation can take advantage of the recent breakthroughs in hierarchical convolutional neural networks for object recognition (e.g. <a href=\"#bib28\">Krizhevsky et al. (2012)</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zeiler and Fergus (2013)</a>; reviewed by <a href=\"#bib31\">LeCun et al., 2015</a>). These networks consist of multiple hierarchically organized layers, which transform simple features at the lower layers, resembling lower visual cortical areas, to representations for shape recognition in higher layers, resembling the inferotemporal cortex (<a href=\"#bib12\">G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc and van Gerven, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016</a>). Recent studies have started to apply hierarchical convolutional networks to achieve semantic segmentation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hong\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Noh et al., 2015</a>). The resulting networks can segment pictures of everyday visual scenes. They first use a convolutional network to determine the semantic categories present in the visual scene, which is followed by a 'deconvolutional network' that retrieves the lower-level features that are part of a particular semantic category. Hence, these models explain why object-recognition facilitates image parsing in human perception (<a href=\"#bib59\">Vecera and Farah, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Peterson et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Korjoukov et al., 2012</a>). The deconvolutional network could be implemented in the visual cortex as a top-down influence from neurons in shape selective cortical areas to neurons in lower visual areas (i.e. generalizing the feedback connections in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hochstein and Ahissar, 2002</a>). We expect that semantic segmentation networks may need to also include horizontal connections in order to account for the serial patterns of reaction times in grouping tasks with natural images (as in <a href=\"#bib27\">Korjoukov et al., 2012</a>). According to this view, the parsing of a natural scene would invoke an incremental grouping process that gradually adds simple features and more complex shape fragments to an evolving perceptual group (<a href=\"#bib52\">Roelfsema, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Roelfsema and Houtkamp, 2011</a>)."

In V1, the distance between neurons with adjacent RFs is 2\u20134\u00a0mm, and it is only slightly larger in higher visual areas (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Harvey and Dumoulin, 2011</a>). Our results therefore suggest that the propagation speed is 8\u201316\u00a0cm/s (2\u20134\u00a0mm/ 25\u00a0ms), which falls neatly in the range of previous neurophysiological measures for the horizontal propagation of neuronal activity in visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hirsch and Gilbert, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Nauhaus et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sato and Carandini, 2012</a>)."

Subjects apparently need this time to spread object-based attention within in the interior of image regions that need to be grouped in perception. The typical time between two saccadic eye movements is ~200\u2013300\u00a0ms and it is therefore tempting to speculate that the duration of visual fixations is optimized to allot time for both object recognition and image parsing before the next saccade is made."

During the explanation of the task we showed all the images once and participants performed 24 practice trials before data collection started to ensure that they understood the task. The participants completed six blocks of 144 trials each, resulting in a total of 864 trials. Within blocks, we randomized the trials of the six cue-conditions and pictures. We required 64 participants (equally distributed across image conditions) to maintain fixation throughout the trial. Whenever fixation was lost (i.e., deviated from the fixation point by more than 1.5\u00b0), the trial was aborted and repeated again later within the same block. The other 24 participants directed their gaze to the fixation point to start the trial, but they were then allowed to make eye movements during the remainder of the trial. Previous studies using related tasks (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jolicoeur and Ingleton, 1991</a>) and stimulus material (<a href=\"#bib27\">Korjoukov et al., 2012</a>) demonstrated that eye movements do not have a strong influence on RT. Indeed, the RTs of subjects that only fixated at the beginning of the trial were highly correlated with those of subjects who maintained fixation (r=0.83, t(70)=12.63, p&lt;0.0001), indicating that eye movements did not have a large influence on RTs. Our main analyses were therefore based on the combined dataset from both experiments. However, if we evaluated the data of the 64 participants that maintained fixation separately, we reproduced the same conclusions: the correlation of the growth-cone model prediction with the RTs to the scrambled cartoons was 0.67, which was significantly better than all other models (p&lt;0.01 in a bootstrap test); the correlation with the data obtained with the cartoon outlines was 0.59, which was significantly better than the other models (p&lt;0.05 in a bootstrap test). In the data set of the 24 participants that were allowed to make saccades we found the same pattern of results: the correlation of the growth-cone model in the scrambled cartoons was 0.81, superior to all other models (p&lt;0.01, bootstrap test); and the correlation of the model prediction with the cartoon outline data-set was 0.55, again, better than the other models (p&lt;0.01, bootstrap test)."

White outlines of two horizontal or vertical bars (broad bars: both bars 3.9\u00b0 wide and 15.6\u00b0 long; or narrow bars: 2.0\u00b0 wide and 15.6\u00b0 long) were presented with one white cue on one end of one of the bars for 100 ms (line thickness of the bars: 0.2\u00b0; line thickness of the cue: 1.2\u00b0). The cue extended over the full width of the bar and for 3.9\u00b0 on the long side of the bar. After cue offset, the bars remained on the screen and participants pressed a button when they detected a red target dot (present in 80% of trials), which appeared at a cue-target onset asynchrony of 200, 300, 400, 500, or 600 ms measured relative to the offset of the cue. The red target dot (0.8\u00b0 diameter) was presented at one of three locations (distance to fixation: 8.3\u00b0) until the button press. The remaining 20 percent of trials were catch trials and the participant had to maintain fixation for 1000\u00a0ms. Feedback was given at the end of every trial for correct (for 500\u00a0ms) or incorrect (for 3000\u00a0ms) responses."

Note that the distance between the cue and the target was identical for the invalid same and invalid different conditions. On each trial, both bars were either broad or narrow. All trial types (3 validity types at a ratio of 3:1:1, horizontal/vertical orientation of the bars, 4 corners, 2 bar widths, 5 cue-target onset asynchronies) were presented twice, resulting in a total of 800 target trials and we interleaved 200 catch trials with a random orientation, cued corner, and bar width. The trial was aborted and repeated later if fixation was lost (gaze deviated by more than 2\u00b0 from fixation) or an error was made. The participants completed 10 blocks of 100 trials. They could proceed to the next block whenever they were ready by pressing a button, but after even-numbered blocks, participants had to take a break of at least 1 min. We instructed the participants to perform the task as accurate and fast as possible."

We used a paired t-test to assess the difference between RTs on valid trials with broad and narrow bars and we used an additional paired t-test to test the RT difference between valid and invalid trials (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). We computed the object-based advantage by subtracting RTs to the invalidly cued targets on the same bar from those on the other bar, separately for broad and narrow bars and for each of the five cue-target onset asynchronies. We fitted a Gaussian function to the object-based RT advantage as function of onset asynchrony to determine the optimal cue-target onset asynchrony for the two bar widths (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>). We applied a bootstrapping procedure to assess the reliability of the peaks of the fitted Gaussian functions. We selected a random sample of subjects (with replacement) and fitted Gaussian functions to the time course of the object-based advantage. We repeated this procedure 10,000 times to compute the 95% confidence interval of the peak time for broad and narrow bars. We used the growth-cone model to determine the number of growth cones between the cue and invalid target position on the same object (3.3 growth-cones for the broad bar; 7.2 for the narrow bar) and computed the speed of the attentional spreading process by dividing the time-difference between the peak same object-advantages for the broad and narrow bar by the difference in the number of growth-cones."

                    "text": "It is perhaps remarkable, but the implications turn out to be minimal. The reason is that the RF sizes of the growth-cone model are not mapped onto specific visual cortical areas. If grouping demands a specific growth-cone size (as measured in \u00b0), the required RFs near the fovea will be in higher visual areas than those at more peripheral locations. Suppose the task demands grouping image patches with a size of ~2\u00b0: Depending on eccentricity, grouping can occur at a low level (e.g. V1 if eccentricity is ~10\u00b0) (Gattass et al. 1981) or at a higher level (e.g. V4 if eccentricity is ~2\u00b0) (Gattass et al. 1988). Thus, if a single elongated bar with a width of 2\u00b0 needs to be grouped (as in our variant of the Egly et al. paradigm, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) the same grouping process involves V4 neurons at 2\u00b0 eccentricity and V1 neurons at 10\u00b0 eccentricity. In V1, neurons with abutting, non-overlapping RFs are separated by 2-4 mm (Hubel &amp; Wiesel 1974; Harvey &amp; Dumoulin 2011), and the distance between neurons with non-overlapping RFs (the \u201cpopulation point image\u201d) is only slightly larger in higher visual areas (Harvey &amp; Dumoulin 2011). It seems likely that the propagation of enhanced neuronal activity through horizontal connections occurs at similar speeds (in m/s) in different visual areas, and it therefore follows that the grouping speed (in \u00b0/s or in growth-cone/s) is constant across eccentricities. The growth-cone mechanism is therefore fully compatible with receptive field sizes increasing with eccentricity."

However, in the revision we now also indicate how future incremental grouping models could take advantage of the new insights derived from convolutional neural networks for object recognition that are composed of multiple hierarchically organized layers (e.g. Krizhevsky et al. (2012); Zeiler & Fergus (2012); see also the review by LeCun et al. (2015)). These convolutional networks provide a useful description of the computations that implement object recognition in the ventral stream, from early visual cortical areas toward the inferotemporal cortex (G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc & van Gerven, 2015; Yamins & DiCarlo, 2016). Recent extensions of hierarchical convolutional networks have been used for semantic segmentation. They can label the image elements that belong to one of the image categories in pictures of everyday visual scenes (Hong et al., 2015; Noh et al., 2015). They solve the chicken-and-egg problem by first determining the semantic categories present in the visual scene with a convolutional network and they then use a \u201cdeconvolutional network\u201d to go from one of the categories back to the low-level features that are part of the objects of this category. It is conceivable that these convolutional/deconvolutional networks, in combination with a horizontal grouping process, might account for the serial patterns of reaction times in grouping tasks with colorful pictures, textures and interior contours (as in Korjoukov et al., 2012). Although this is a promising avenue for future research, these more complex models remain to be built, as we now indicate in a new section of the Discussion (\u201cInfluence of object recognition and interior contours on image parsing\u201d)."

We note, however, that Palmer and Rock (1994) claimed that multiple regions are automatically parsed in separate uniform connected regions, irrespective of whether they have the same or different surface properties. This rule has been rather influential (the paper received 556 citations according to Google Scholar), which is why we used it as a baseline for our results."

As anticipated by the reviewer, grouping was fastest if the target curve had a unique contrast polarity, a finding that provides additional evidence against the \u201cuniform connectedness\u201d rule. We have now more carefully described the \u201cuniform connectedness rule\u201d, clearly indicating that this was a previous proposal by Palmer & Rock (1994).

I think that the discussion could benefit here from some conceptual aspects. For example, explain why the growth-cone process as used in the model runs into difficulties with internal boundaries and discuss potential implications, does it mean for instance that some form of distinguishing internal from external boundaries is implied prior to the application of the attention-spread process?</i>"
