In <i>Drosophila</i>, the mushroom body (MB) plays a key role in these processes. Sensory stimuli are sparsely represented by \u223c2000 Kenyon cells, which converge onto 34 output neurons (MBONs) of 21 types. We studied the role of MBONs in several associative learning tasks and in sleep regulation, revealing the extent to which information flow is segregated into distinct channels and suggesting possible roles for the multi-layered MBON network. We also show that optogenetic activation of MBONs can, depending on cell type, induce repulsion or attraction in flies. The behavioral effects of MBON perturbation are combinatorial, suggesting that the MBON ensemble collectively represents valence. We propose that local, stimulus-specific dopaminergic modulation selectively alters the balance within the MBON network for those stimuli. Our results suggest that valence encoded by the MBON ensemble biases memory-based action selection."

For each line, we compared the fraction of time the split-GAL4/dTrpA1 line does each of 14 behaviors to two controls: empty GAL4 crossed to dTrpA1 (pBDPGAL4U/dTrpA1) and split-GAL4/+. Each data point corresponds to the fraction of time that all 20 flies in a given video performed the given behavior. The table contains a dash if the behavioral differences to both controls had different signs. Otherwise, we use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare to each control separately, adjust the p-value using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for controlling the false discovery rate to 0.05, and report the (conservative) maximum adjusted p-value of the comparison to each control. The average number of videos (n) analyzed for each split-GAL4/TrpA1 line was 5.0, for each split-GAL4/+ line was 4.2, and for the pBDPGAL4U/TrpA1 line was 143.",

In <i>Drosophila</i>, the mushroom body (MB) plays a key role in these processes. Sensory stimuli are sparsely represented by \u223c2000 Kenyon cells, which converge onto 34 output neurons (MBONs) of 21 types. We studied the role of MBONs in several associative learning tasks and in sleep regulation, revealing the extent to which information flow is segregated into distinct channels and suggesting possible roles for the multi-layered MBON network. We also show that optogenetic activation of MBONs can, depending on cell type, induce repulsion or attraction in flies. The behavioral effects of MBON perturbation are combinatorial, suggesting that the MBON ensemble collectively represents valence. We propose that local, stimulus-specific dopaminergic modulation selectively alters the balance within the MBON network for those stimuli. Our results suggest that valence encoded by the MBON ensemble biases memory-based action selection."

Results revealed that distinct groups of output cells must be activated for flies to avoid\u2014as opposed to approach\u2014odors. Moreover, the same output neurons are used to avoid both odors and colors that have been associated with punishment. Together, these results indicate that the output cells do not encode the identity of stimuli: rather, they signal whether a stimulus should be approached or avoided. The output cells also regulate the amount of sleep taken by the fly, which is consistent with the mushroom body having a broader role in regulating the fly's internal state."

It then needs to choose adaptive behaviors, such as approaching cues that predict food and avoiding cues that predict danger. The neural computations involved in using such memory-based valuation of sensory cues to guide action selection require at least three processes: (1) sensory processing to represent the identity of environmental stimuli and distinguish among them; (2) an adaptive mechanism to assign valence\u2014positive or negative survival value\u2014to a sensory stimulus, store that information, and recall it when that same stimulus is encountered again; and (3) decision mechanisms that receive and integrate information about the valence of learned stimuli and then bias behavioral output. To understand such decision-making processes, one approach is to locate the sites of synaptic plasticity underlying memory formation, identify the postsynaptic neurons that transmit stored information to the downstream circuit and discover how their altered activities bias behavior."

In <i>Drosophila</i>, olfactory information is delivered to the MB by projection neurons from each of \u223c50 antennal lobe glomeruli (<a href=\"#bib85\">Marin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib136\">Wong et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Jefferis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Lin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib134\">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib146\">Yu et al., 2010</a>).

                                "text": "(<b>A</b>) The innervation patterns of extrinsic neurons define 15 compartments in the MB lobes and one compartment in the core of distal pedunculus (pedc); the compartments are represented by rectangles that are color-coded based on the neurotransmitter used by the mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) having dendrites in that compartment (green, glutamate; blue, GABA; orange, acetylcholine). Projection neurons (far left, colored arrows) from the antennal lobe convey olfactory sensory information to the MB calyx where they synapse on the dendrites of Kenyon cells (KCs). The parallel axon fibers of the KCs (gray lines) form the lobes (\u03b1/\u03b2, \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 and \u03b3) where KCs terminate onto the dendrites of the MBONs. Each of the seven types of KCs innervates a specific layer within a given lobe. The dendrites of individual MBON types and the terminals of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) intersect the longitudinal axis of KC axon-bundles in specific compartments along the lobes. MBONs using the same transmitter are spatially co-localized in the lobes (See <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Innervation areas of PPL1 and PAM cluster DANs axons in the MB lobes are indicated by the rectangles outlined in dashed lines. Activation of subsets of DANs can convey punishment or reward, respectively inducing aversive or appetitive memory when activation is paired with odor presentation. The size of arrows indicates magnitude of memory induced by DAN activation. See text for references. (<b>B</b>) Schematic representation of the 21 cell types of MBONs in the lobes and one cell type of MBON in the calyx based on the data presented in the accompanying manuscript (<a href=\"#bib7\">Aso et al., 2014</a>): circles, cell bodies; semicircles, dendrites; arrowheads, axon terminals; color-coding is by neurotransmitter as in panel (<b>A</b>) Three MBON cell-types (GABAergic MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2, glutamatergic MBON-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32 and MBON-\u03b21&gt;\u03b1; marked as 11, 5 and 6 respectively) send axons into the MB lobes. Axons of MBON-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32 project from \u03b34 to \u03b31 and \u03b32, and thus have the potential to affect activity of MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2. From \u03b31, the axon of MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2 projects to compartments in the \u03b1/\u03b2 lobes including \u03b21, where dendrites of MBON-\u03b21&gt;\u03b1 arborize. Axons of both MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2 and MBON-\u03b21&gt;\u03b1 project to the compartments in the \u03b1 lobe. Therefore activity of MBONs in the \u03b1 lobe can be regulated by these layered inter-compartmental connections. These three types of MBONs (11, 5 and 6) do not project back to their own dendrites. Therefore, the organization of the MBONs can be viewed as forming a multilayered feed-forward network (<a href=\"#bib7\">Aso et al., 2014</a>). MBONs project to a small number of brain areas: the crepine (CRE; a region surrounding the horizontal/medial lobes), the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP), superior intermediate protocerebrum (SIP) and superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP) and the lateral horn (LH). The size of the arrowhead reflects the relative number of termini in each area. The MBONs are numbered and listed in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. See the accompanying manuscript (<a href=\"#bib7\">Aso et al., 2014</a>) and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> for details."

In contrast to KCs, MBONs have broadly tuned odor responses; any given odor results in a response in most MBONs, although the magnitude of the response varies among MBON cell types (Hige et al., unpublished) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Cassenaer and Laurent, 2012</a>). Unlike the stereotyped response to odors of the olfactory projection neurons that deliver odor information to the MB, the odor tuning of the MBONs is modified by plasticity and varies significantly between individual flies, suggesting that MBONs change their response to odors based on experience (Hige et al., unpublished)."

This is thought to provide a mechanism by which the response of MBONs to a specific odor could represent that odor's predictive value. D1-like dopamine receptors and components of the cAMP signaling pathway, such as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin-responsive adenylate cyclase encoded by the <i>rutabaga</i> gene, are required specifically in the KCs for memory formation (<a href=\"#bib83\">Livingstone et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib147\">Zars et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib113\">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Kim et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">McGuire et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Gervasi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Qin et al., 2012</a>) and <i>rutabaga</i> was shown to be required for the establishment of the differences in MBON odor tuning between individuals (Hige et al., unpublished). Reward and punishment recruit distinct sets of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) that project to specific regions in the MB lobes (<a href=\"#bib84\">Mao and Davis, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Burke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, exogenous activation of these DANs can substitute for reinforcing stimuli to induce either appetitive or aversive memory, depending on DAN cell type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib139\">Yamagata et al., in press</a>, <a href=\"#bib98\">Perisse et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Schroll et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Claridge-Chang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Aso et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Burke et al., 2012</a>). In sum, while the identity of the learned odor is likely encoded by the small subset of KCs activated by that odor, whether dopamine-mediated modulation assigns positive or negative valence to that odor would be determined by where in the MB lobes KC-MBON synapses are modulated and thus which MBON cell types alter their response to the learned odor."

This view implies that multiple independent valuation modules for positive or negative experiences coexist in the MB lobes, raising the question of how the outputs across all the modules are integrated to result in a coherent, adaptive biasing of behavior."

Based on our anatomical analyses (<a href=\"#bib7\">Aso et al., 2014</a>), we believe that just 34 MBONs of 21 types provide the sole output pathways from the MB lobes. To gain mechanistic insight into how the ensemble of MBONs biases behavior, we would first like to know the nature of the information conveyed by individual MBONs and the extent to which their functions are specialized or segregated into different information channels. Then we need to discover how the activities of individual MBONs contribute to influence the behavior exerted by the complete population of MBONs. Thus, in order to understand how memory is translated into changes in behavior, we need to have experimental access to a comprehensive set of MBONs and investigate how the outputs from different MBONs bias behavior, singly and in combination."

Dendrites of MBONs that use the same neurotransmitter\u2014GABA, glutamate or acetylcholine\u2014are spatially clustered in the MB lobes.

MBONs have their axonal terminals in a small number of brain regions, but their projection patterns also suggest pathways for relaying signals between compartments of the MB lobes; three MBONs send direct projections to the MB lobes and several other MBONs appear to target the dendrites of specific DANs."

In this study, we have used improved genetic tools and employed several strategies to mitigate their remaining limitations, as detailed below and in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. By assaying many different behaviors with the same genetic reagents, we were better able to evaluate the specificity of the behavioral effects we observed. Our experimental design placed an emphasis on avoiding false positives. Extensive analysis was restricted to MBON lines showing a phenotype in the initial screens and our scoring criteria were conservative. Consequently, we are likely to have missed detecting some cell types with effects on the behavior under assay."

                                "text": "We sought to first determine the nature of the information conveyed by MBONs. In the most widely used olfactory conditioning assay, memory is assessed after training by allowing flies to distribute between two arms of a T-maze: one arm perfused with a control odor and the other arm with an odor that had been previously associated with punishment or reward. If the valence of the learned odor were encoded by the altered activities of specific MBONs, artificial activation of those MBONs in untrained flies in the absence of odor presentation would be expected to result in avoidance or approach behavior that mimicked the conditioned odor response. To test this hypothesis, we used a circular arena in which groups of flies expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson (<a href=\"#bib69\">Klapoetke et al., 2014</a>) in MBONs were allowed to freely distribute between dark quadrants and quadrants with activating red light (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). Activating sensory neurons for CO<sub>2</sub> or bitter taste in this manner induced strong avoidance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib120\">Suh et al., 2007</a>). By testing our collection of MBON split-GAL4 drivers in this assay, we found cell types whose activation resulted in avoidance of the red light and others whose activation led to attraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Behavioral valence was highly correlated with MBON transmitter type: all MBONs eliciting aversion were glutamatergic and all the MBONs eliciting attraction were either GABAergic or cholinergic. We selected two split-GAL4 drivers for each neurotransmitter type for further analysis, choosing lines that gave robust phenotypes in the initial screening and that showed highly specific expression patterns based on direct assessment of CsChrimson expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013F</a>). The phenotypes of these lines were reproducible (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013I</a>) and none of the drivers showed significant preference to the red light in the absence of the CsChrimson effector (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), confirming that phototaxis was limited at the wavelength and intensity of light used. These results demonstrate that activation of MBONs is itself sufficient to elicit either approach or avoidance, depending on the cell type."

Approximately twenty female flies were placed in a 10 cm circular arena in a dark chamber and allowed to distribute themselves freely among the four quadrants. From 30\u201360 s, two of the quadrants (Q2&amp;3) were illuminated with 617 nm peaked red LED lights to activate CsChrimson-containing neurons; from 90\u2013120 s, the other two quadrants (Q1 &amp; 4) were illuminated instead. No quadrants were illuminated from 0\u201330 s or from 60\u201390 s. The flies were video recorded and their locations in the arena were used to calculate behavioral preferences. (<b>B</b>) For these time-domain plots, the quadrant preference at each point in time was calculated as [(number of flies in Q2&amp;3) - (number of flies in Q1&amp;4)]/(total number of flies). Flies expressing CsChrimson in receptor neurons for CO<sub>2</sub> or for bitter taste (using the indicated drivers and <i>20xUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus in attP18</i>) avoided the illuminated quadrants, whereas the control genotype (empty driver, <i>pBDPGAL4U</i> in <i>attP2</i>/<i>20xUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus in attP18</i>) showed a very slight preference for illuminated quadrants. Lighter colored areas around lines indicate the standard error of the mean. (<b>C</b>) Screening of MBON drivers for behavioral valence. The red-light preference index (PI) was defined as: [(number of flies in illuminated quadrants) - (number of flies in non-illuminated quadrants)]/(total number of flies). For each 2-min experiment, the overall PI was calculated by averaging the PIs from the final 5 s of each of the two red-lights-on conditions (namely, 55\u201360 s and 115\u2013120 s). MBON cell types expressed in each driver are shown in the matrix below the graph; collectively all the drivers covered 20 of the 22 MBON types. MBON-\u03b33 and MBON-\u03b33\u03b2\u20321 are listed together, because these MBON cell types are always labeled together in our split-GAL4 lines.

For example, MB011B and MB052B, which drive expression in groups of three or five cell types that use the same transmitter (the glutamatergic M4/M6 and cholinergic V2 clusters, respectively; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), caused strong responses, while activation with drivers for smaller subsets or individual cell types within these groups had much reduced effects (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Although activation of the single cell types MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2 or MBON-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32 had a significant effect, these neurons send axonal projections to other compartments in the MB lobes, giving them the potential to directly influence the activity of additional MBON cell types. Given that multiple MBONs can independently contribute to behavioral valence as measured by attraction vs repulsion, we sought to determine how conflicting or consonant information from multiple MBONs is integrated to bias behavior. We combined two split-GAL4 drivers for cell types with either similar or opposite effects in the same fly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). When combining drivers eliciting similar responses, flies generally showed a stronger response than to either driver alone. Conversely, co-activation of MBON cell types with opposing effects resulted in intermediate responses. Together, these data are consistent with a simple combinatorial model of valence integration."

To carry out appropriate changes in speed and direction, a fly needs to evaluate both the valence of the learned odor and its own trajectory relative to the location of the odor source. To assess which aspects of locomotion are modified by MBON activation to generate a bias between approach and avoidance, we analyzed the behavior of flies in a 10 mm-wide graded lighting choice zone centered on the border between dark and illuminated quadrants. We tracked the trajectories of individual flies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>) and calculated the fraction of flies crossing the choice zone from the \u2018light-off\u2019 to the \u2018light-on\u2019 area (and vice versa) as well as the fraction of flies changing direction in the choice zone thus returning to the area they came from."

The choice zone was defined as \u00b1 5 mm from the light ON/OFF border (green box). (<b>B</b>) Gradient of light intensity across the light ON/OFF border axis shown. (<b>C</b>) An example of MB434B + MB011B/UAS-CsChrimson fly that entered the choice zone from the light-off side at time = 0 and then stopped and quickly turned around to exit the choice zone, going back into the light-off side. Eleven images taken at 0.1 s intervals have been superimposed. Entry angle to the choice zone was defined as diagramed (top left). Speed and angular speed was calculated based on the difference in the position of a fly in successive frames of 30 frames per second video recordings. (<b>D</b>) The fraction of trajectories entering the choice zone from the dark side and then exiting to the illuminated side is plotted for the indicated drivers in combination with CsChrimson (top). The control genotype was the empty driver, <i>pBDPGAL4U,</i> in <i>attP2</i> in combination with <i>20xUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus in attP18</i>. Only flies that entered the choice zone at an entry angle of between 45 and 135\u00b0 (facing to the light ON/OFF border) and had moved more than 5 mm in the 1 s prior to entering the choice zone were analyzed. The error bars show the 95% confidence interval. Between 79 and 410 trajectories were analyzed per genotype. Compared to the control, MB434B + MB011B, MB434B and MB011B showed a significantly lower fraction of trajectories that exit to the light-on side (more avoidance of light), whereas significantly higher fraction of trajectories of MB112C + MB077B flies exit to the light-on side (more attraction to the light); multiple comparisons with the Dunn-Sidak correction: ***, p &lt; 0.001. Similarly, the fraction of trajectories entering the choice zone from the illuminated side and then changing direction so as to also exit to the illuminated side is plotted for the indicated drivers in combination with CsChrimson (bottom). Between 43 and 280 trajectories were analyzed per genotype. (<b>E</b>) Representative trajectories are shown for the indicated genotypes. The trajectories are color-coded to indicate the position of the fly in the trajectory as a function of time after entering the choice zone. The triangle shows the position of the fly at time = 0, when flies entered into the choice zone (indicated by the white line at \u22125 mm from the light ON/OFF border). The gray scale background in the panels and pseudo-color scale on the right indicate the intensity of CsChrimson activating light. (<b>F</b>) Preference index to the CsChrimson-activating light (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) was plotted against the fraction of trajectories that exit from the choice zone to the illuminated side irrespective of side of entry: [(number of trajectories enter to the choice zone from dark side and then exit to illuminated side) + (number of trajectories enter to the choice zone from illuminated side and then exit to illuminated side)] divided by total number of trajectories that entered into the choice zone. They were highly correlated (Spearman's rank-order correlation: Pearson r = 0.91; R square = 0.83; p &lt; 0.001). Genotypes are the same as in panel D and are shown with same color code. (<b>G</b>) Preference index to the CsChrimson light (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) was plotted against the mean walking speed change in the illuminated quadrants compared to dark quadrants (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In contrast, we found little correlation between preference index and either mean walking speed or mean angular velocity, an indicator of turning probability, of flies in illuminated quadrants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>). Flies are able to adjust these parameters to execute avoidance behaviors in other contexts; we found that activation of some chemosensory neurons and projection neuron combinations that repelled flies significantly altered both walking and angular speed (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Our results indicate that MBON activity biases the direction that flies turn in the choice zone, thereby biasing the direction in which they exit that zone. We did not observe a stereotyped turning behavior in the choice zones; more specifically, the time between entering the choice zone and making a turn as well as the precise direction of the turn varied (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>; <a href=\"#media2 media3\">Videos 2 and 3</a>). Moreover, flies displayed apparently normal behavior within the uniform illumination of lighted quadrants (<a href=\"#media2 media3\">Video 2 and 3</a>), showing no apparent increase in their speed and turning rates. These observations support the view that MBONs represent valence, abstract information that serves to bias\u2014rather than direct\u2014specific motor patterns."

After a 60 s pause, 3-octanol (OCT) was delivered without electric shock. For the reciprocal group, OCT was paired with electric shock, and MCH was delivered without shock. 2 hr after training, flies were given a choice between the two odors in a T-maze and their distribution was used to calculate a performance index (PI). The PI corresponds to the mean of the [(number of flies in the OCT tube minus number of flies in the MCH tube)/total number of flies when OCT was paired with electric shock] and [(number of flies in the MCH tube minus number of flies in the OCT tube)/total number of flies when MCH was paired with electric shock].

Blocking dopaminergic input to the MB compartments where the dendrites of MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2 reside, using MB438B, also impairs 2-hr aversive odor memory. <i>UAS-Shi x1</i> was used as the effector.

Inactivation of MB052B, which broadly labels cholinergic V2 cluster MBONs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), resulted in nearly complete loss of aversive odor LTM recall (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>).

We also assayed five lines that express in subsets of the MBONs found in MB052B. While some of them showed lower memory scores, none showed a statistically-significant memory impairment (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Therefore, our results suggest that V2 cluster MBONs (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>) function as a group in the retrieval of aversive odor LTM. Consistent with this implied combinatorial action of V2 cluster MBONs, activating subsets of these MBONs with CsChrimson resulted in weak attraction that only reached statistical significance when MB052B was used as the driver (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In calcium imaging experiments, V2 cluster MBONs were reported to reduce their response to an odor that had been learned to be aversive (<a href=\"#bib114\">Sejourne et al., 2011</a>); this sign of plasticity is consistent with our observation that activation of these neurons elicited attraction."

However, we were unable to attribute this aversive LTM phenotype to MBON-\u03b13, because blocking this cell type by other drivers did not result in a consistent phenotype (MB093C, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>; G0239, (<a href=\"#bib104\">Placais et al., 2013</a>)). The requirement for MBON-\u03b13 for aversive odor LTM has been reported, but it is unclear whether these neurons are required for canonical LTM after spaced training (<a href=\"#bib94\">Pai et al., 2013</a>) or instead for so-called \u2018fasting LTM\u2019, a memory that mildly fasted flies can form after a single cycle of conditioning (<a href=\"#bib54\">Hirano and Saitoe, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Placais and Preat, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Placais et al., 2013</a>). We note that these same two split-GAL4 driver lines for MBON-\u03b13 (MB082C and MB093C) also showed discordant results in the ethanol memory assay (see below), suggesting some underlying difference between the two lines, perhaps in off-targeted expressions or genetic background.

Conditioned ethanol preference is measured by presenting two odors in sequence, one in the presence of an intoxicating dose of ethanol, three times for 10 min with 50-min breaks between exposures, followed by testing for preference between the two odors in a Y-maze in the absence of ethanol either 30 min or 24 hr after training. Wild-type flies find the ethanol-paired odor to be aversive when tested 30 min after training, but appetitive 24 hr after training. (<b>B</b>) Results of assays for the requirement of MBONs in ethanol-induced appetitive odor memory. <i>pJFRC100-20XUAS-TTS-Shibire-ts1-p10</i> (<i>VK00005</i>) was used to block synaptic transmission during training and test; flies were kept at the permissive temperature for the 24 hr between training and test. MBONs have been grouped by neurotransmitter and color-coded. The bottom and top of each box represents the first and third quartile, and the horizontal line dividing the box is the median.

Avoidance, attraction, wake-promoting and sleep-promoting phenotypes reflect the results of activating MBONs; the other assays measured the effects of blocking synaptic transmission. Activation of glutamatergic MBONs repelled flies and promoted wakefulness, whereas activation of GABAergic or cholinergic MBONs attracted flies and promoted sleep.

Partially overlapping set of cholinergic and glutamatergic MBONs were required for all three appetitive memory assays.

From the motor perspective, as described above, MBONs bias locomotive outcomes rather than dictate a stereotyped low-level motor program. From the sensory perspective, we have shown that the same MBONs can be required for experience-dependent behavioral plasticity irrespective of whether a conditioned stimulus is a color or an odor, and irrespective of the specific identity of the odor. Taken together with the fact that MBONs lie immediately downstream of the sites of memory formation, these observations support our proposal that MBONs convey that a stimulus has a particular value\u2014but not the identity of the stimulus itself. This contrasts with sensory neurons whose activity can also induce approach or avoidance, but which do convey the stimulus per se. In mammals, neural representations of abstract variables such as \u2018value\u2019, \u2018risk\u2019 and \u2018confidence\u2019 are thought to participate in cognition leading to action selection (for example, see <a href=\"#bib65\">Kepecs et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Levy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib140\">Yanike and Ferrera, 2014</a>).

Activation of a single DAN such as PPL1-\u03b31pedc that innervates a highly localized region of the MB can induce robust aversive memory, yet the odor associated with the punishment will activate MBONs from all compartments, including MBONs that can drive approach as well as those that drive avoidance. We propose that, in response to a novel odor stimulus, the activities of MBONs representing opposing valences may initially be \u2018balanced\u2019, so that they do not impose a significant bias. Behavior would then be governed simply by any innate preference a fly might have to that odor, using neuronal circuits not involving the MB. Now suppose an outcome associated with that stimulus is learned. Such learning involves compartment-specific, dopamine-dependent plasticity of the KC-MBON synapses activated by that stimulus. If that occurs, the subsequent ensemble response of the MBONs to that stimulus would no longer be in balance and an attraction to, or avoidance of, that stimulus would result. Consistent with this idea, eliminating MB function by disrupting KCs, which are nearly 10% of neurons in the central brain, had surprisingly minor effects on odor preference (<a href=\"#bib33\">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">Heisenberg et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">McGuire et al., 2001</a>). <a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a> shows a conceptual model of how this could be implemented at the level of neuronal circuits."

Glutamatergic (Glu; green), GABAergic (GABA; blue) and cholinergic (Ach; orange) MBONs all receive KC input; the names of MBONs are based on the lobe compartment where their dendrites arborize. CsChrimson activation of some glutamatergic MBONs can be repulsive, whereas activation of GABA or cholinergic MBONs can be attractive (color coded as indicated by the scale at bottom right) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We often only observed significant behavioral effect with combinations of cell types (indicated by dashed lines grouping multiple cell types). MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2, and glutamatergic MBONs, MBON-\u03b21&gt;\u03b1 and MBON-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32, have synaptic terminals inside the compartments of MB lobes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Aso et al., 2014</a>). While the microcircuits within each MB compartment remain to be elucidated, our light level anatomical studies have enumerated the cell types present in each compartment. The \u03b12 and \u03b13 compartments contain the dendrites of cholinergic MBONs and are targeted by both the GABAergic MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2 and the glutamatergic MBON-\u03b21&gt;\u03b1. These MBONs cover only a small fraction of volume in their target compartments (see <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); since they could contact only a fraction of Kenyon cells, we propose that they target MBONs directly. Here we hypothesize that glutamate is inhibitory to cholinergic and GABAergic MBONs, and GABA is inhibitory to glutamatergic MBONs (inhibitory connections are indicated by circles). The thickness of lines and size of their endings are meant to indicate activity levels. (<b>B</b>) PPL1- \u03b31pedc DANs play a major role to mediate punishment signals to the MB for formation of aversive memory together with minor contribution from other DANs including PPL1-\u03b32\u03b1\u20321 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Aso et al., 2012</a>). If an aversive memory is formed by the simultaneous presentation of an odor and punishment and results in a synaptic depression of KC terminals by dopamine (represented by red dashed circles), the response of the GABAergic MBONs to the CS+ would be depressed (see text). Reduced GABAergic inhibitory input would then increase the CS+ response of glutamatergic MBONs, whereas the CS+ response of cholinergic MBONs would be reduced because of dis-inhibition of the inhibitory glutamatergic MBONs. The end result is enhanced activity of aversion-mediating glutamatergic MBONs together with the reduced activity of attraction-mediating GABAergic and cholinergic MBONs in response to CS+. The CS- is represented by a different set of KCs whose synaptic connections to the MBONs would not be expected to be modified by training and so the responses of the ensemble of MBONs to the CS- would remain balanced. The change in response of the MBONs to the CS+, relative to their unchanged response to the CS-, biases choice toward the CS+ (see diagram in panel <b>D</b>). This model is consistent with the essential role of MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2 in aversive memory. Also, cholinergic MBONs in V2 cluster have been shown to reduce their response to an odor after olfactory conditioning with electric shock (S\u00e9journ\u00e9 et al., Nat. Neurosci., 2011), although we detected their requirement only for long-term memory, but not for 2 hr memory. This model predicts a role for glutamatergic MBONs, but we did not observe significant effect by blocking subsets of glutamtergic MBONs (<a href=\"#fig6 fig8\">Figures 6 and 8</a>). Thus, to test this model, it will be necessary to block broader sets of glutamatergic MBON cell types by using combinations of split-GAL4 drivers. (<b>C</b>) In contrast to aversive memory in which one type of DAN (PPL1-\u03b31pedc) plays a major role in memory formation, reward signals are mediated by a distributed set of PAM cluster DANs that innervate the compartments of glutamatergic MBONs (<a href=\"#bib139\">Yamagata et al., in press</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Burke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Perisse et al., 2013</a>). If an appetitive memory is formed by synaptic depression of KC terminals in response to dopamine release, the response of the glutamatergic MBONs to the CS + would be depressed. The resultant reduced glutamatergic inhibitory input to the GABAergic and cholinergic MBONs would increase their response to the CS+. In turn, increased GABAergic input to glutamatergic MBONs may further amplify and stabilize the initial effects of plasticity. The end result would be reduced activity of aversion-mediating glutamatergic MBONs together with the increased activity of attraction-mediating GABAergic and cholinergic MBONs in response to CS+. This model is consistent with requirement of glutamatergic MBONs: blocking the M4/M6 cluster MBONs (MBON-\u03b35\u03b2\u20322a, MBON-\u03b2\u20322mp and MBON-\u03b2\u20322mp_bilateral; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) by MB011B resulted in memory impairment for all three appetitive memory assays (<a href=\"#fig7 fig9 fig11\">Figures 7, 9 and 11</a>). Blocking the MBON-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32 and MBON-\u03b21&gt;\u03b1 by MB434B resulted in memory impairment in two of three assays (<a href=\"#fig9 fig11\">Figures 9 and 11</a>). While we did not detect a requirement for the GABAergic MBON-\u03b31ped&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2 in appetitive memory, previous study have shown that dopamine input to the \u03b31 and pedc suppresses expression of appetitive memory in fed flies (<a href=\"#bib72\">Krashes et al., 2009</a>), indicating some role of MBON-\u03b31ped&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2 in appetitive memory. Blocking cholinergic MBONs in the V3/V4 cluster (MBON-\u03b32\u03b1\u20321, MBON-\u03b1\u20322 and MBON-\u03b13) resulted in memory impairment in appetitive odor memories (<a href=\"#fig7 fig11\">Figures 7 and 11</a>) (<a href=\"#bib104\">Placais et al., 2013</a>) but not in appetitive visual memory (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Some of driver lines for the cholinergic MBONs in the V2 cluster showed impairment of appetitive memory in all three assays (<a href=\"#fig7 fig9 fig11\">Figures 7, 9 and 11</a>), although our data did not allow mapping to the resolution of specific cell types due to inconsistent results obtained using other lines. (<b>D</b>) In the matrix shown, the number of circles represents the activity levels of MBONs in response to the CS+ odor (the odor that is paired with the unconditioned stimulus during conditioning) and the CS\u2212 odor (a control odor). In untrained flies, the activities of MBONs for opposing effects are balanced. Dopamine modulation breaks this balance to bias the choice between CS+ and CS\u2212."

Consistent with this large body of work, we found that one type of PPL1 cluster DAN, PPL1-\u03b31pedc, played a central role in formation of aversive memory in both olfactory (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib8\">Aso et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Aso et al., 2010</a>) and visual learning (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) paradigms. This DAN also mediates aversive reinforcement of bitter taste (<a href=\"#bib31\">Das et al., 2014</a>). For appetitive memory, PAM cluster DANs that innervate other regions of the MB lobes, in particular the compartments of glutamatergic MBONs, are sufficient to induce appetitive memory (<a href=\"#bib139\">Yamagata et al., in press</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Burke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Liu et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#bib98\">Perisse et al., 2013</a>).

For example, activation of MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2 and MBON-\u03b32\u03b1\u20321 attracted flies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), whereas DAN input to these regions induced aversive memory (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Aso et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2012</a>). Conversely, activation of glutamatergic MBONs repelled flies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), while DAN input to the corresponding regions is known to induce appetitive memory (<a href=\"#bib139\">Yamagata et al., in press</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Burke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Liu et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#bib98\">Perisse et al., 2013</a>). These results are most easily explained if dopamine modulation led to synaptic depression of the outputs of the KCs representing the CS + stimulus. Consistent with this mechanism, the PE1 MBONs in honeybees (<a href=\"#bib93\">Okada et al., 2007</a>) as well as the V2 cluster MBONs in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib114\">Sejourne et al., 2011</a>) reduce their response to a learned odor and depression of KC-MBON synapses has been shown for octopamine modulation in the locust MB (<a href=\"#bib25\">Cassenaer and Laurent, 2012</a>). Moreover, long-term synaptic depression is known to occur in the granular cell synapses to Purkinje cells in the vertebrate cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ito et al., 1982</a>), a local neuronal circuit with many analogies to the MB (<a href=\"#bib112\">Schurmann, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Laurent, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Farris, 2011</a>). Other mechanisms are also possible and multiple mechanisms are likely to be used. For example, dopamine may modulate terminals of KCs to potentiate release of an inhibitory cotransmitter such as short neuropeptide F, which has been demonstrated to be functional in KCs (<a href=\"#bib70\">Knapek et al., 2013</a>) and hyperpolarizes cells expressing the sNPF receptor (<a href=\"#bib115\">Shang et al., 2013</a>). RNA profiling of MBONs should provide insights into the molecular composition of synapses between KCs and MBONs. It is also noteworthy that the effect of dopamine can be dependent on the activity status of Kenyon cells; activation of PPL1-\u03b31pedc together with odor presentation induces memory, while its activation without an odor has been reported to erase memory (<a href=\"#bib16\">Berry et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Placais et al., 2012</a>). In the vertebrate basal ganglia, dopamine dependent synaptic plasticity important for aversive and appetitive learning is known to result in both synaptic potentiation and synaptic depression (<a href=\"#bib117\">Shen et al., 2008</a>)."

As a consequence, we gained some insights into the extent to which the relative importance of particular MBONs differed between behaviors (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>). Most obvious was the segregation between appetitive and aversive behaviors. For example, we found that blocking MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2 impaired both short-term aversive odor and visual memory, suggesting a general role in aversive memory independent of modality. Conversely, a subset of glutamatergic MBONs was required in all three appetitive memory assays. It still remains to be demonstrated that the outputs of these MBONs are required transiently during memory retrieval. Nevertheless, CsChrimson activation experiments demonstrate that activation of these MBONs can directly and transiently induce attraction and avoidance behaviors."

We also found cases where the DANs and MBONs required for a behavior do not innervate the same compartments of the MB lobes. For example, even though several cholinergic MBONs are required for appetitive memory (<a href=\"#bib104\">Placais et al., 2013</a>), the compartments with cholinergic MBONs do not receive inputs from reward-mediating PAM cluster DANs, but instead from PPL1 cluster DANs that have been shown to be dispensable for odor-sugar memory (<a href=\"#bib113\">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). What accounts for this mismatch? Perhaps these cholinergic MBONs' primarily function is in memory consolidation rather than retrieval. But the fact that CsChrimson activation of the cholinergic MBON-\u03b32\u03b1\u20321 and V2 cluster MBONs resulted in attraction, strongly suggests that at least some of the cholinergic MBONs have a role in directly mediating the conditioned response. Indeed, previous studies found a requirement for cholinergic MBONs (the V2 cluster and MBON-\u03b13) during memory retrieval (<a href=\"#bib114\">Sejourne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Pai et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Placais et al., 2013</a>). One attractive model is that requirement of cholinergic MBONs originates from the transfer of information between disparate regions of the MB lobes through the inter-compartmental MBONs connections within the lobes or by way of connections outside the MB, like those described in the next two sections."

Previous studies and our results indicate that circuits in the \u03b1 lobe play key roles in long-term aversive and appetitive memory (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>) (<a href=\"#bib96\">Pascual and Preat, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Isabel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib144\">Yu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Blum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib114\">Sejourne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Pai et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Placais et al., 2013</a>).

As pointed out in (<a href=\"#bib7\">Aso et al., 2014</a>), this circuit structure is well-suited to deal with conflicts between long-lasting memory traces and the need to adapt to survive in a dynamic environment where the meaning of a given sensory input may change. To test the proposed role of the layered arrangement of MBONs in resolving conflicts between old memories and new sensory inputs, we will also need behavioral paradigms that, unlike the simple associative learning tasks used in our current study, assess the neuronal requirements for memory extinction and reversal learning."

These eight examples show sub-stack projections of confocal image data; we estimate that the terminals of the two types of neurons in each case are separated by less than a micron, as judged by examination of the original stacks. Only neurons of interest are shown for clarity; several of these GAL4 and LexA drivers label many other cell types. The reporter constructs <i>pJFRC200-10XUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-HA</i> (<i>attP18</i>) and <i>pJFRC216-13XLexAop2-IVS-myr::smGFP-V5</i> (<i>su(Hw)attP8</i>) were used. (<b>A</b>\u2013<b>B</b>) One of clonal lineages in the antennal lobe, ALlv1, contains an atypical class of AL projection neurons, the ALlv1-PNs, which do not project to the MB calyx, but directly project to the SMP, SIP and SLP in addition to the lateral horn (<a href=\"#bib145\">Yu et al., 2013</a>). ALlv1-PNs that are visualized in <i>R35F02-LexA</i> terminate in a specific region of the SMP (arrowhead), where MBON-\u03b32\u03b1\u20321 (A; MB077C) and MBON-\u03b1\u20322 (B; MB091C) also terminate. (<b>C</b>) The lateral horn output neurons (LHONs) in <i>R47G10-LexA</i> have dendrites in the dorsal region of the LH and axons that project to a confined region in the SIP, where ALlv1-PNs in <i>R59G08-GAL4</i> also project (arrowhead).

                                "text": "Using inactivation to uncover the roles of specific cell types is inherently limited by redundancy and resiliency within the underlying neural circuits. For example, consider the MBONs from the \u03b1/\u03b2 lobes. The output of the \u03b1/\u03b2 Kenyon cells is known to be required for retrieval of aversive memory (<a href=\"#bib57\">Isabel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Krashes et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">McGuire et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</a>). Our anatomical and behavioral results show that MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2, a cell type we found to be critical for aversive memory, has terminals largely confined inside the \u03b1/\u03b2 lobes, well-positioned to regulate a total 6 types of MBONs from the \u03b1/\u03b2 lobes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Yet we did not detect a requirement for any of these MBONs in short term aversive memory when tested individually. The ability to detect phenotypes also depends on the strength of the effector; for example, four glutamatergic MBON drivers showed aversive memory impairment in initial screening assays with a strong inhibitor of synaptic function, but we were not able to confirm these effects using a weaker effector (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

                                "text": "The failure to see effects when inactivating individual cell types is most easily explained by combinatorial roles and redundancy between MBONs. We note that this high level of resiliency is very reminiscent of observations made with genetic networks, where less than half of gene knockouts of evolutionarily conserved <i>Drosophila</i> genes result in a detectable phenotype (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ashburner et al., 1999</a>). Whether or not we detect a requirement for a particular MBON in a particular learning paradigm is likely to depend on which DANs are recruited by the US used in that paradigm as well as the degree of redundancy in the MBON representation of valence. It will be informative to test systematically whether blocking combinations of MBONs, which did not show significant behavioral effect when blocked separately, results in significant memory impairment. It will also be important in future experiments to employ imaging and electrophysiological methods, in which the activities of individual neurons, and the consequences of plasticity, can be observed without being obscured by redundancy."

                                "text": "The MBs are implicated in functions beyond processing of associative memory (<a href=\"#bib86\">Martin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Liu et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Joiner et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Pitman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib148\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Hong et al., 2008</a>). MBONs that influence approach to, or avoidance of, a learned stimulus may also have roles in innate preference behaviors for temperature and hunger-dependent CO2 avoidance (<a href=\"#bib55\">Hong et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Bracker et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, we expect the behavioral repertoire that MBONs govern to go beyond simple approach and avoidance; the MB is known to play a role in experience-dependent regulation of proboscis extension (<a href=\"#bib87\">Masek and Scott, 2010</a>) and courtship (<a href=\"#bib88\">McBride et al., 1999</a>) as well as regulation of sleep (<a href=\"#bib62\">Joiner et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Pitman et al., 2006</a>) and post-mating behaviors such as oviposition (<a href=\"#bib42\">Fleischmann et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Azanchi et al., 2013</a>). Intriguingly, we found that MBONs whose activation was repulsive promoted wakefulness, whereas MBONs whose activation was attractive promoted sleep; it would make sense for flies to be awake and attentive in an adverse environment. Other internal states, in addition to sleep, are likely to affect the decision to carry out a particular memory-guided behavior; for example, the state of satiety has been shown to regulate memory expression (<a href=\"#bib72\">Krashes et al., 2009</a>). The diverse influences of MBONs on behavior can be most easily explained if we assume that the activity of the ensemble of MBON conveys an abstract representation of both valence and internal state. In this view, the ensemble of MBONs may represent internal states along axes such as pleasant-unpleasant or aroused-not aroused. It is upon these axes that primitive forms of emotion are thought to have evolved (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</a>)."

We believe that this practice addresses a potential weakness in many prior studies where expression patterns have been determined with an indicator construct inserted in one chromosomal site, while perturbing function with an effector residing at another site. The lack of precise correlation between the expression pattern of the indicator and effector introduces significant uncertainty. The best practice would be to directly measure the expression of the effector protein itself, something we were able to do for the red-shifted channel rhodopsin CsChrimson-mVenus (<a href=\"#bib69\">Klapoetke et al., 2014</a>) by staining for mVenus. The next best approach is to have the indicator of expression and the effector inserted at the same chromosomal location, which we were able to achieve for all cases except the assays of the 2 hr aversive and appetitive odor memory which used a weaker UAS-Shibire effector based on a P-element insertion. We used the following UAS-indicators for the matrices shown in Figures: <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <i>20XUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus</i> (<i>attP18</i>) reared at 22\u00b0C; <a href=\"#fig7 fig9 fig10 fig11\">Figures 7B, 9B, 10B, 11B</a>, <i>pJFRC2-10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP</i> (<i>VK00005</i>) reared at 18\u00b0C [similar expression was observed with <i>pJFRC225-5xUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-FLAG</i> (<i>VK00005</i>) reared at 25\u00b0C]; <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>, <i>pJFRC200-10xUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-HA</i> (<i>attP18</i>) reared at 22\u00b0C.

These drivers have much more restricted expression patterns than those previously used, allowing greater certainty in assigning the effects of perturbations to specific cells. Even with these improved GAL4 drivers, there can be significant variation in expression levels between drivers or in different cell types within the expression pattern of a single driver, as well as off-target expression and variations in genetic background. To assign a function to a cell population, we therefore required that the effects of a manipulation be observed using two different GAL4 drivers for that cell population. In cases where we only had one split-GAL4 driver for a cell type, we believe it is only appropriate to interpret an observed phenotype as suggestive, except in cases where we were confirming a previously published result. Finally, we interpret some results as simply raising the possibility of a role for a cell type. For example, where one GAL4 line resulted in a significant effect, but a second line with a very similar expression pattern did not. There were also cases where we saw a consistent tendency in multiple lines, but where none of the individual lines themselves reached statistical significance."

The time course of one cycle of aversive conditioning was as follows: flies were exposed to the first odorant for 1 min while twelve 1.5 s, 60-V electric shocks, separated by 3.5 s, were delivered; after a 45 s rest, flies were exposed to the second odorant for 1 min. Two odorants, 3-octanol and 4-methyl-cyclohexanol, were used alternatively as the conditioned stimulus. For all assays (training, memory test and olfactory acuity), odorants were diluted in mineral oil at a final concentration of 0.36 mM for octanol and 0.325 mM for methyl-cyclohexanol, and were delivered by 0.4 l/min airflow bubbled through odor-containing bottles.

The authors (and they are multitude, reflecting the need for expertise for each behavior examined) suggest the major function of MBONs is to encode valence. In this view MB outputs are not themselves driving motor patterns, but rather they are setting the bias to favor some subset of the possible motor programs. The support for this idea is necessarily at this point somewhat circumstantial, but the upshot of the behavioral experiments is that many different behaviors require the exact same MBON or set of MBONs. The commonality between the behavioral situations does not have to do with the qualities or sensory mode of the stimulus, but rather with whether or not the animal likes or dislikes it. Importantly, the isolated activation of these neurons can be shown, in some cases, to appear to drive the animal to behave as if it has an aversion or attraction. The small number of MBONs coupled with the large number of MB-influenced behaviors demand this type of model, since one-to-one connections with motor systems would simply be anatomically untenable."

This will be an important resource for many in the community. Second, and critically, this paper goes beyond cataloging to give us a credible model of what this piece of brain is built to do. This is something that will be important for anyone working in any nervous system who is interested in how behavioral decisions are made."

A huge body of literature coming from several different insect species (not just <i>Drosophila</i>; maybe check to see that some of the other insects are cited early on?) has already established that mushroom bodies are a multi-modal integration center. In <i>Drosophila</i>, the bulk of the work on the question \u201cwhat do MBs do\u201d has come from dissection of olfactory associative memory. In this paper, and accompanying manuscripts, the authors take a big step towards answering this question by systematically cataloging and then manipulating the MB output neurons. After generating reagents to manipulate each of the individual MBONs, the effects of these manipulations were then measured in the context of a series of well-studied MB dependent behaviors. These include innate responses to odor (including attraction vs avoidance), aversive and appetitive odor memory, aversive and appetitive visual learning, aversive and appetitive ethanol learning, and sleep."

What emerges is an over-arching hypothesis in which MBs integrate information about the environment (including internal state and past experience) and where activity in individual groups of MBONs bias responses towards outputs that are adaptive given the valance of the stimuli. And these findings hang together for the most part in terms of how MBONs group together in terms of valence in the innate responses, impact on memory, and neurotransmitter types."

But there are cases where the added impact of blocking individual MBONs doesn\u2019t add up to the whole behavior. The most striking example is aversive olfactory memory, where only one MBON (gamma-ped&gt;alpha/beta) has an effect, and the effect is partial. This can be explained of course by the potential that combinations of other MBONs can impact (i.e. redundancy), or conceptually at least by there being unknown MBONs. This should be discussed."

This consists of two types of experiment: genetic rescue experiments in which individual mutations are rescued with spatially restricted transgene expression, and experiments in which individual KC classes are silenced/activated. The findings with MBONs here are not really integrated into in the Discussion section. The most clear example of this is the MBON-gamma-ped&gt;alpha/beta neuron. In aversive olfactory conditioning, all relevant DA input to DopR comes in through gamma lobes during learning, and retrieval and consolidation involve alpha/beta. So this MBON is ideally positioned to play an important role, but this wasn\u2019t discussed in the text. On the other hand, in appetitive learning, there is evidence (actually from one of the authors) that early and later memories are parallel in gamma and alpha/beta. Again, this is not really discussed. I realize that the manuscript is long, has many findings, and it is not possible to place every finding in context. But this MBON is one of the few that is front and center in this study, so I thought these findings should be integrated better conceptually into the literature."

The most striking example is aversive olfactory memory, where only one MBON (gamma-ped&gt;alpha/beta) has an effect, and the effect is partial.

There are several reasons for this. Most importantly, the effects of blocking the small number of cells in individual lines might not rise above the inherent noise of behavioral assays to become statistically significant. Consider the case of olfactory aversive learning pointed out by the reviewer. One neuron, a GABAergic MBON, had a strong effect, but still only resulted in 40-50% reduction compared to the controls. However, in the initial screening with a strong effector (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), we observed that four glutamatergic MBONs lines had an effect in our initial screening assays, but these same lines did not give a significant effect when subsequently retested with a weaker effector. The simplest explanation of these observations is that these individual MBONs had effects that were only obvious when using a strong effector. Further experiments will be required, but we suspect that these lines do play a role in aversive memory and in combination would produce significant effects with either effector."

The negative data could be due to too weak or too strong expression of the effector as well as off-targeted expression. To explore such possibility, we have repeated the choice assay of 7 driver lines using 5x, 10x, 20xUAS-CsChrimson in attP18. Presumably depending on the intensity of driver, we observed much weaker or no significant phenotype with 5xUAS-CsChrimson for majority of lines. Conversely, in some driver lines, we observed significant effect with 10xUAS-CsChrimson but not with 20xUAS-CsChrimson. This is possibly due to toxicity of 20xUAS-CsChrimson when expressed at too high level; CsChrimson driven with pan-neuronal drivers such as elav-GAL4 and R57C10-GAL4 are lethal. Because these experiments are preliminary we did not add them to the paper, but did include the following sentence in Materials and Methods: \u201cOnly data obtained with 20x<i>20XUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus</i> (<i>attP18</i>) are shown in this study.

So this MBON is ideally positioned to play an important role, but this wasn\u2019t discussed in the text. On the other hand, in appetitive learning, there is evidence (actually from one of the authors) that early and later memories are parallel in gamma and alpha/beta.
