                    "text": "Corrective responses to limb disturbances are surprisingly complex, but the neural basis of these goal-directed responses is poorly understood. Here we show that somatosensory feedback is transmitted to many sensory and motor cortical regions within 25 ms of a mechanical disturbance applied to the monkey\u2019s arm. When limb feedback was salient to an ongoing motor action (task engagement), neurons in parietal area 5 immediately (~25 ms) increased their response to limb disturbances, whereas neurons in other regions did not alter their response until 15 to 40 ms later. In contrast, initiation of a motor action elicited by a limb disturbance (target selection) altered neural responses in primary motor cortex ~65 ms after the limb disturbance, and then in dorsal premotor cortex, with no effect in parietal regions until 150 ms post-perturbation. Our findings highlight broad parietofrontal circuits that provide the neural substrate for goal-directed corrections, an essential aspect of highly skilled motor behaviors."

Here we show that somatosensory feedback is transmitted to many sensory and motor cortical regions within 25 ms of a mechanical disturbance applied to the monkey\u2019s arm. When limb feedback was salient to an ongoing motor action (task engagement), neurons in parietal area 5 immediately (~25 ms) increased their response to limb disturbances, whereas neurons in other regions did not alter their response until 15 to 40 ms later. In contrast, initiation of a motor action elicited by a limb disturbance (target selection) altered neural responses in primary motor cortex ~65 ms after the limb disturbance, and then in dorsal premotor cortex, with no effect in parietal regions until 150 ms post-perturbation. Our findings highlight broad parietofrontal circuits that provide the neural substrate for goal-directed corrections, an essential aspect of highly skilled motor behaviors."

OFC includes state estimation (i.e. position and velocity of the body segments) based on sensory and internally generated feedback.

While the mathematical details of OFC are not implemented at the neural level, the OFC framework creates an important dichotomy between state estimation and the control policy. From this perspective, perturbation-related activity in a brain region that is not influenced by the behavioral goal would be associated with the former, whereas perturbation-related activity that is modified by the behavioral goal, would be associated with the latter."

At that time, the prevailing view was that task-dependent changes in long-latency motor responses, that occur 50 to 100\u00a0ms after a mechanical disturbance, were provided by a transcortical feedback pathway from primary somatosensory to primary motor cortex (<a href=\"#bib14\">Desmedt, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brooks, 1986</a>). The timing of mechanical responses in M1 are sufficiently fast to generate these long-latency responses. Classic work by Evarts and Tanji illustrated that perturbation responses in M1 could be modulated when the disturbance was the cue for the monkey to push or pull a lever (<a href=\"#bib17\">Evarts and Tanji, 1974</a>). Further studies implicated the dentate nucleus in this task-dependent feedback processing (<a href=\"#bib31\">Meyer-Lohmann et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vilis et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Strick, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hore and Vilis, 1984</a>), likely through its connections to M1 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Orioli and Strick, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dum and Strick, 2003</a>). Based on this evidence, it has been generally assumed that there was minimal overlap in cortical circuits involved in online feedback processing from the limb (S1 and M1), and the broad parietal and frontal cortical circuits involved in motor planning and initiation."

The magnitude of the perturbation response is also greatest in S1 and diminishes spatially across the cortex. This gradient in the timing and magnitude of perturbation-related activity across the cortical surface may be generated by intra-cortical communication, although subcortical sensory feedback pathways may also be involved (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cappe et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Padberg et al., 2009</a>)."

However, the very fastest responses are likely due to muscle afferents even in area 3b (<a href=\"#bib19\">Heath et al., 1976</a>). Neurons in S1 with cutaneous receptive fields are broadly tuned to the direction of movement during reaching (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cohen et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Prud\u2019homme et al., 1994</a>), much like neurons in M1 with receptive fields from shoulder and elbow muscles (<a href=\"#bib24\">Scott and Kalaska, 1997</a>). Correspondingly, we expect both muscle and cutaneous afferents will be broadly tuned to loads applied to the shoulder and elbow, and contribute to feedback responses observed in the present study. Yet the differential physiological contributions of each of these feedback sources to control are an interesting question, warranting further investigation."

This suggests M1 is the primary cortical source for implementing this aspect of control (along with dentate). While changes in perturbation-related activity was only observed in PMd at the same time or later than that\u00a0observed in limb muscles, this cortical area did show changes in baseline activity for the IN and OUT targets before perturbation onset. One can also see a small (non-significant) dip in the differential signal in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> at about 40\u00a0ms post-perturbation. Thus, PMd may play some role in this process of using sensory feedback for action selection. In contrast, all parietal regions examined in the present study displayed no change in perturbation-related activity until ~150\u00a0ms when differences in limb motion begin to emerge (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pruszynski et al., 2014</a>), suggesting none of these regions were involved in this aspect of control.

In contrast, the initial response was unaltered in other cortical regions, but they then increased 15\u00a0ms later or more, potentially driven by A5. Parietal area 5 has been implicated in somatomotor and visuomotor processing for limb motor actions (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mountcastle et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chapman et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kalaska, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Debowy et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Reichenbach et al., 2014</a>). Preparatory activity in this cortical region reflects the selective use of the limb for a subsequent motor action (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cui and Andersen, 2011</a>). Our data suggests a potential role of A5 in online control, consistent with recent studies demonstrating TMS over medial intraparietal sulcus in humans (approximate analog to A5 in NHPs) prolongs corrective responses to mechanical disturbances during reaching (<a href=\"#bib45\">Reichenbach et al., 2014</a>). Thus, posterior parietal cortex is not only important for online control of visual feedback (<a href=\"#bib15\">Desmurget and Grafton, 2000</a>), but also somatosensory feedback. The fact that perturbation-related activity was altered between the movie and postural tasks initially suggests a role in the control policy rather than state estimation. However, changes in perturbation-related activity in A5 were related to whether the animal was engaged or not in a behavioral task. There was no change in its response when using sensory feedback to select a new goal, as the animal remained engaged in a task before and after this selection. Thus, it may instead play a role in linking state estimation to the control policy for online control."

The robot permitted combined flexion and extension movements of the shoulder and elbow in the horizontal plane and applied loads to the shoulder and/or the elbow independently. Two monkeys (Monkey X &amp; A) used a right-arm robot and one monkey (Monkey P) used a left-arm robot. Targets and hand visual feedback were presented to the monkeys, in the horizontal plane, using an overhead monitor and a semitransparent mirror. Hand position was represented by a white circle (5\u00a0mm diameter) positioned at the tip of the index finger. The Queen\u2019s University Animal Care Committee approved all experimental procedures (Protocol 1348)."

At a random time (1000\u20131500\u00a0ms), the limb was perturbed with one of nine combinations of loads applied to the shoulder and/or elbow (flexor, extensor or null), and the monkey had to return its hand to the target within 750\u00a0ms of the perturbation time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Each perturbation lasted 300ms and the size of the load varied with the size of the monkey (Monkey P &amp; X, 0.24\u00a0Nm and monkey A, 0.32\u00a0Nm). Load magnitudes were adjusted in the bi-articular load directions to compensate for larger hand motions induced in these directions (<a href=\"#bib21\">Herter et al., 2007</a>).

Single tungsten microelectrodes (FHC, Bowdoin) were advanced in the cortex until neural activity was recorded. We verified the location of shoulder and elbow areas of M1 by eliciting muscle twitches using microstimulation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Stoney et al., 1968</a>) and the response of neurons to passive movement of the joints. The shoulder/elbow regions in other cortical areas were generally at the same laterality as that in M1. We tested sensory receptive fields of neurons particularly in the first few sessions of recording in a new cortical area to make sure we were in the shoulder/elbow representation. While recording in the sensory cortices, we also tried to differentiate the best modality of stimulus for each neuron (e.g. cutaneous, soft touch, deep touch or joint movement). However, the robotic device attached to the arm made it difficult to dissociate whether sensory responses during manual examination were related to muscle or cutaneous afferents. The majority (~85%) of our recordings from A5 were performed over the convexity of the cortex (area 5d). Neural recordings in S1 were equally on the surface (putative Area 1), bank of post-central sulcus (putative area 3b) and deep in post-central sulcus (putative area 3a)."

The neuron\u2019s activity in its PTD was then compared to its activity in the null load condition (catch trial) using a two-sample t-test.

The baseline period consisted of cell/population activity 100\u00a0ms prior to the perturbation (average population baseline for each area is represented as insets in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). A similar approach was used to identify when population signals associated with different conditions (Posture versus Movie Tasks, or IN and OUT targets) were significantly different (differential signals). We compared the onset times of perturbation responses and differential signals across cortical areas using a bootstrap technique, resampling (with replacement) cells in each population 10000 times, and then calculating the response onset for each iteration. We also rank ordered the onset across different areas in each iteration and calculated the percentage of times activity in one area preceded that of others. In calculating the percentages, we also included iterations where the population or difference signal did not pass 3SD."

Unfortunately, we did not consider this type of analysis when designing our experiment as we only have 10 trials per load condition making it difficult for individual neurons to reach statistical significance. At the single cell level, there are some neurons that had significant correlations with joint reversal times (10% in M1). At the population level, M1 was the only cortical region that displayed a significant correlation. The low correlation level for the M1 population (r= -0.11) is not surprising as even arm muscle activity has rather low correlations (Crevecoeur et al., 2013). We have added this analysis to the Results section."

These areas were recognized in mapping sessions, which were performed following the recording chamber implantation and before behavioral recording sessions were performed. In these sessions, as a general rule, we first identified M1 and then explored other rostral-caudal areas at this same lateral distance from the midline. If the cells had responses to hand and wrist movement, we then moved our penetrations to more lateral sites to find shoulder/elbow cells. We also tested cell receptive fields more closely in the first few sessions of recording in a new area to make sure we were in the shoulder/elbow region for a given cortical area. We now explain this process in more detail in the Methods section. We have also included the penetration map for the monkey that was euthanized and in which we can relate cortical surface maps to the penetration sites (refer to supplemental material)."

Reaching studies highlight that neurons with cutaneous receptive fields in area 3b are broadly tuned to the direction of hand motion like all other cortical areas, probably reflecting skin stretch in response to the perturbation (Cohen et al., 1994). Both cutaneous and muscle afferents will likely generate similar patterns of broad tuning to loads applied to the shoulder and elbow. Further, area 3b that is commonly assumed to be receive purely cutaneous information actually receives substantive input from muscle afferents (Heath et al., 1976). Muscle afferents tend to be a bit faster than cutaneous although the difference can be small (Heath et al., 1976). We have added a paragraph in the Discussion to raise the point that while muscle afferents likely play a dominant role providing feedback of limb motion from the applied loads, cutaneous afferents also likely contribute. We have also tried to explain why differentiating these modalities is not easy while the animal is in the robot. We have also tried to clarify in more detail the penetration sites within S1 in the Methods section."

Notably, R1 responses are generated at the spinal level and are fairly fixed responses that do not reflect task-level corrective responses. In contrast, R2 responses are influenced by many different behavioral level factors and occur at a time point when cortical activity can contribute. These observations lay the groundwork for the present work to begin to unravel how cortex may be involved in these goal-directed motor corrections that begin in the R2 epoch. The comparisons across tasks allow us to identify when perturbation-related activity is task-independent (like R1) and task-dependent (like R2). We assume the issue is that we don\u2019t link our task-dependent effects in cortex to the motor periphery. Thus, we have added some statements in the Discussion to more explicitly state that task-dependent changes observed in M1 for the IN/OUT task are appropriate for driving the subsequent R2 muscle responses."
