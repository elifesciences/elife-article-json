Inhibition of IL, irrespective of its intrinsic neural activity, attenuates not only the ability of environmental cues predictive of reward availability to promote reward seeking, but also the ability of environmental cues predictive of reward omission to suppress this behavior. Here we report that such bidirectional behavioral modulation in rats is mediated by functionally distinct units of neurons (neural ensembles) that are concurrently localized within the same IL brain area but selectively reactive to different environmental cues. Ensemble-specific neural activity is thought to function as a memory engram representing a learned association between environment and behavior. Our findings establish the causal evidence for the concurrent existence of two distinct engrams within a single brain site, each mediating opposing environmental actions on a learned behavior."

Inhibition of IL, irrespective of its intrinsic neural activity, attenuates not only the ability of environmental cues predictive of reward availability to promote reward seeking, but also the ability of environmental cues predictive of reward omission to suppress this behavior. Here we report that such bidirectional behavioral modulation in rats is mediated by functionally distinct units of neurons (neural ensembles) that are concurrently localized within the same IL brain area but selectively reactive to different environmental cues. Ensemble-specific neural activity is thought to function as a memory engram representing a learned association between environment and behavior. Our findings establish the causal evidence for the concurrent existence of two distinct engrams within a single brain site, each mediating opposing environmental actions on a learned behavior."

Based on the correlational evidence from electrophysiological and calcium imaging studies, it is commonly thought that multiple engrams concurrently exist within a single brain site at a single stage of learning. Previous studies have established the causal evidence that a single brain area (<a href=\"#bib27\">Warren et al., 2016</a>) or ensemble (<a href=\"#bib21\">Redondo et al., 2014</a>) can represent two different engrams at two different stages of learning (e.g., before vs. after extinction training). However, the causal evidence supporting the concurrent existence of multiple engrams within a single brain site, each mediating different environmental actions on a learned behavior (e.g., a go/no-go task), is still lacking."

To test this hypothesis, we developed an animal model for bidirectional environmental modulation of reward seeking, and utilized a neural activity-targeted disruption technique (Daun02 pharmacogenetic inactivation in <i>Fos-lacZ</i> transgenic rats) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Koya et al., 2009b</a>) to inhibit neural ensembles in IL specifically activated by either S+ or S- cues."

Each of the four groups prepared for the Daun02 disruption was further divided into three groups defined by the final Fos-induction conditions (\u2018S+\u2019, \u2018S-\u2019 or \u2018No S+/S-\u2019). Each rat was subjected to one of these conditions. However, active lever and light-cue were not introduced in order to determine IL ensembles specifically reactive to S+ or S-. Three-way ANOVA on Fos-positive nuclei in IL revealed significant effects of microinjection (F<sub>(1,78)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a07.695, p&lt;0.01), Fos-induction (F<sub>(2,78)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a031.129, p&lt;0.001), and significant interactions for disruption-cue and Fos-induction (F<sub>(2,78)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a014.803, p&lt;0.001), disruption-cue and microinjection and Fos-induction (F<sub>(2,78)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a011.016, p&lt;0.001). In the two vehicle-treated control groups (\u2018S+ &amp; vehicle\u2019 and \u2018S- &amp; vehicle\u2019), both S+ and S- significantly increased Fos-positive nuclei in IL (Ps\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05\u20130.01). In the group that received Daun02 following exposure to S+ (\u2018S+ &amp; Daun02\u2019), Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by S+ prevented the induction of Fos by S+ but spared the induction by S- (p&lt;0.05). In the group that received Daun02 following exposure to S- (\u2018S- &amp; Daun02\u2019), Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by S- significantly reduced the induction of Fos by S- but spared the induction by S+ (p&lt;0.05). Thus, Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by either S+ or S- exclusively altered the cue-triggered neural activation uniquely linked to the targeted cue in a single animal."

Because Daun02 disruption of IL neurons activated by either S+ or S- exclusively altered the behavioral response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) as well as neural activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) uniquely linked to the targeted cue, mutually exclusive rather than overlapping neural ensembles in IL likely mediate the bidirectional environmental control of reward seeking. As is the case of recent studies that utilized similar activity-dependent procedures (e.g., <a href=\"#bib21\">Redondo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Grosso et al., 2015</a>), the current results demonstrate the functional significance of manipulating brain cells based on their activity in addition to other characteristics, such as locality and phenotype. We thus raise caution to the use of non-selective techniques that manipulate neural activity irrespective of intrinsic neural activity for determining the brain behavioral functions. Finally, our findings provide the causal evidence for the concurrent existence of multiple engrams, each mediating different and even opposing environmental actions on a behavior, in a single brain area. In light of recent studies implicating differential brain processes in differential environmental control of a learned response (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ciocchi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Trouche et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adhikari et al., 2015</a>), ensemble-specific neural phenotype as well as both local and brain-wide neurocircuitry involving each unique engram should be elucidated in future studies."

General schematics and timeline are depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. This model consisted of twelve experimental phases and lasted over six months. The rats were always trained and tested during the dark (active) phase in a dedicated operant conditioning chamber (\u2018chamber\u2019) equipped with two retractable levers (one \u2018active lever\u2019 and one \u2018inactive lever\u2019), a \u2018light-cue\u2019 and a drinking well. At all times, insertion of both active and inactive levers signaled the start of a once daily operant conditioning session conducted under a fixed ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement. During this session, a press on the active lever resulted in a single delivery of 0.2 ml of either sweet solution containing 3% glucose and 0.125% saccharin dissolved in water (\u2018glucose &amp; saccharin\u2019) or plain water (\u2018water\u2019) into the drinking well. In our pilot experiments (data not included), this combination of glucose and saccharin produced more robust operant responding than solutions containing either glucose or saccharin alone. Each delivery of either sweet solution or water was paired with 5s illumination of the light-cue signaling a 5s time-out period. During the 5s time-out period, presses on the active lever were recorded but without a scheduled consequence. At all times, presses on the inactive lever were recorded but without a scheduled consequence. Throughout the course of this model, the rats were repeatedly subjected to habituation periods (both between-sessions and within-sessions) in order to minimize the neurobehavioral impact of environmental cues (e.g., experimenters and chambers) other than those manipulated experimentally (i.e., active lever, light-cue, S+ and S-). Three different cohorts of rats were subjected to the entire behavioral procedure (i.e., three biological replicates)."

The rats were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups defined by disruption-cue (two levels: S+ or S-) and microinjection (two levels: Daun02 or vehicle). All rats were placed in the chamber and habituated for 30 min. The disruption cue (S+ or S-) was then introduced. The rats remained in the chamber for additional 90 min in the presence of S+ or S-. This timing (90 min) was to optimally induce \u03b2-galactosidase and Fos in neurons activated by either S+ or S- (<a href=\"#bib13\">Koya et al., 2009b</a>). In order to disrupt the neurons specifically activated by S+ or S-, both levers and light-cue were not introduced, and thus the rats were withheld from lever pressing. The rats then received a bilateral microinjection of Daun02 (2.0 \u00b5g/0.5 \u00b5l/side) or vehicle (0.5 \u00b5l/side) into IL, and returned to their homecages.

The authors bi-directionally modulate reward-seeking behaviour by identifying and inactivating IL neurons previously active either during reward availability of omission. They further show that cells in the IL increase their activity in response to both reward availability and omission cues, and they go on to successfully inactivate these ensembles to block cue-specific increases in neuronal activity. Overall, the experiments are well thought out, the paper is well written, and I view the current manuscript as an outstanding bridge between cells that differentially process discrete experiences and their causal contributions to reward seeking behaviour."

Thus, unfortunately, the experiment suggested here is not technically possible in <i>Fos-lacZ</i> rats. Moreover, to our knowledge, no method currently exists to distinctly tag separate neuronal ensembles in rats. While such methods do exist for mice (e.g., TetTag mice, Reijimers et al., 2007, Science, 317:1230-3), replicating the current experiments in mice will be beyond the reasonable scope of the current study.
