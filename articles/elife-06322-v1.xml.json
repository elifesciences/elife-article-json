                    "text": "Porokeratosis (PK) is a heterogeneous group of keratinization disorders. No causal genes except <i>MVK</i> have been identified, even though the disease was linked to several genomic loci. Here, we performed massively parallel sequencing and exonic CNV screening of 12 isoprenoid genes in 134 index PK patients (61 familial and 73 sporadic) and identified causal mutations in three novel genes (<i>PMVK</i>, <i>MVD</i>, and <i>FDPS</i>) in addition to <i>MVK</i> in the mevalonate pathway. Allelic expression imbalance (AEI) assays were performed in 13 lesional tissues. At least one mutation in one of the four genes in the mevalonate pathway was found in 60 (98%) familial and 53 (73%) sporadic patients, which suggests that isoprenoid biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of PK. Significantly reduced expression of the wild allele was common in lesional tissues due to gene conversion or some other unknown mechanism. A G-to-A RNA editing was observed in one lesional tissue without AEI. In addition, we observed correlations between the mutations in the four mevalonate pathway genes and clinical manifestations in the PK patients, which might support a new and simplified classification of PK under the guidance of genetic testing."

No causal genes except <i>MVK</i> have been identified, even though the disease was linked to several genomic loci. Here, we performed massively parallel sequencing and exonic CNV screening of 12 isoprenoid genes in 134 index PK patients (61 familial and 73 sporadic) and identified causal mutations in three novel genes (<i>PMVK</i>, <i>MVD</i>, and <i>FDPS</i>) in addition to <i>MVK</i> in the mevalonate pathway. Allelic expression imbalance (AEI) assays were performed in 13 lesional tissues. At least one mutation in one of the four genes in the mevalonate pathway was found in 60 (98%) familial and 53 (73%) sporadic patients, which suggests that isoprenoid biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of PK. Significantly reduced expression of the wild allele was common in lesional tissues due to gene conversion or some other unknown mechanism. A G-to-A RNA editing was observed in one lesional tissue without AEI. In addition, we observed correlations between the mutations in the four mevalonate pathway genes and clinical manifestations in the PK patients, which might support a new and simplified classification of PK under the guidance of genetic testing."

This large and diverse class of chemicals provides the building blocks for making many other important molecules in all living species. Zhang, Li et al. have now analysed genetic material from 134 different porokeratosis patients to search for mutations in other genes involved in the production of isoprenoids. The patients examined include 61 people with a family history of the disorder, and 73 cases in which the condition seems to be a one-off occurrence."

Further analysis of these three genes and <i>MVK</i> revealed that about half of the patients with mutations in the <i>MVK</i> gene developed large lesions (that were over 5 centimetres in diameter). However, those with mutations in the other three genes did not develop such large lesions. Mutations in some of the newly identified genes were instead linked to porokeratosis affecting specific areas of the body; for example, <i>PMVK</i> and <i>MVD</i> mutations are linked to porokeratosis localized to the genitals and around the eyes, respectively. This means that, in the future, doctors might be able to simplify the diagnosis of the different varieties of porokeratosis based on information gained via genetic tests."

The extension primer has a 5\u2032 exonuclease-resistance modification and the block probe has a 5\u2032 phosphorate and 3\u2032exonuclease-resistance modification. These two oligos are mixed with genomic DNA, heat-denatured, and then annealed to the same strand of the target DNA fragment. The primer extends and stops until it meets the block probe, and the extension product is then ligated with the block probe by a thermal stable ligase. The above procedure can be repeated n times on the PCR machine using a two-step PCR cycling program. The extension and ligation product is then purified by an exonuclase mixture digestion to remove any DNA fragment with no exonuclease-resistance modification at both ends such as remained primers or probes, primer dimers and genomic DNA, and then amplified using universal NGS PCR primer pairs. A CPELA reaction can include hundreds of extension primer-blocking probe sets and simultaneously amplify hundreds of target DNA fragments for subsequent massively parallel sequencing."

Except for one common <i>MVD</i> mutation of c.746T&gt;C, all deleterious candidate SNVs and large deletions were undetected in healthy family members and 270 unrelated ethnically matched controls. In total, we identified 13 mutations in <i>MVD</i>, six mutations in <i>PMVK</i>, four mutations in <i>FDPS</i>, and 28 mutations in <i>MVK</i> in 113 of the 134 PK patients (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Notably, 21 of the 28 MVK mutations are novel (<a href=\"#bib9b\">Li and Zhang, 2014</a>). These mutations include 30 missense (58%), two start codon (4%), five nonsense (10%), seven indels (14%), four splicing defects (8%), and three large deletions (6%), and predictably affect functions of the respective enzymes. The two <i>MVD</i> mutations (c.746T&gt;C and c.875A&gt;G) were identified in 50 unrelated patients, accounting for 81% of all patients with <i>MVD</i> mutations. Among the 60 familial patients in whom at least one mutation was found, 30 had <i>MVD</i> mutations, three had <i>PMVK</i> mutations, two had <i>FDPS</i> mutations, 24 had <i>MVK</i> mutations, and one had both <i>MVK</i> and <i>MVD</i> mutations.

Further investigation would be necessary to test this hypothesis. We did not find reduced expression or somatic mutation of the wild allele in only two LTs.

The four genes <i>MVK</i>, <i>PMVK</i>, <i>MVD</i>, and <i>FDPS</i> are members of the mevalonate pathway, suggesting that this pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of PK. The mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis provides precursors of isoprenoids, which are ubiquitous in living species and diverse in biological function (<a href=\"#bib19\">Smit and Mushegian, 2000</a>) and serve as precursors of cholesterol, heme A, ubiquinones, dolichol, and isoprenylated proteins (e.g., RAS and Lamin B) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Moreover, it is also the subject of many pharmacological regulating drugs such as statins. It is well known that cholesterol is an important constituent of the cell membrane of most eukaryotic cells, and several inherited disorders have been linked to defects in cholesterol biosynthesis. The isoprenylated proteins play a role in the regulation of cell growth, division, and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Moir and Spann, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Zwerger et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Davidson and Lammerding, 2014</a>) and are probably associated with the retained nuclei in the stratum corneum (i.e., parakeratosis). We propose that the accumulation of abnormal metabolites or shortage of isoprenoids might predispose patients to idiopathic inflammation of the skin, and that correction of the abnormal isoprenoid biosynthesis might be a novel therapeutic direction for PK. Further functional studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis."

SNV calling was performed using both GATK (<a href=\"#bib11\">McKenna et al., 2010</a>) and Varscan programs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Koboldt et al., 2012</a>), and the called SNV data were then combined. The Annovar program was used for SNV annotation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). The functional effect of non-synonymous SNVs was assessed by the PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and MutationTaster (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ng and Henikoff, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Adzhubei et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Schwarz et al., 2010</a>). Non-synonymous SNVs with SIFT score of &lt;0.05, Polyphen-2 score of &gt;0.85 or MutationTaster score of &gt;0.85 were considered as significant of not being benign. To sort potentially deleterious variants from benign polymorphisms, perl scripts were used to filter the SNVs against those of dbSNP135. Any SNV recorded in dbSNP135 and with a minor allele frequency of \u22651% in Chinese from 1000 genome database was considered as benign polymorphisms and therefore removed for subsequent analysis."

The principle of CNVplex technology is described in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>. We utilized this technology for quantitative analysis of copy numbers of all 37 exons and upstream promoter regions in the <i>MVK</i>, <i>MVD</i>, <i>PMVK</i>, and <i>FDPS</i> genes for the blood DNA samples with no point mutation identified and the tissue DNA samples. Based on the copy number measurements for all target sequences, the breakpoints were estimated to be located between two neighboring probe target sites showing different copy numbers. Several primer sets flanking the two probe target sites were tested to amplify the target region from case and control DNA samples using a long PCR protocol. Specific PCR products from case samples were sequenced using the ABI BigDye3.1 and the breakpoints were determined by blasting the sequences with human reference genome assembly."

Mutations in mevalonate kinase (MVK), a key enzyme in sterol synthesis, were shown previously by these authors to cause the disease in a subset of individuals, but the etiology in most affected individuals has remained unknown. Here the authors test the hypothesis that the disease is due to defective isoprenoid generation and function. First, they used linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing to identify a second defective gene in the mevalonate pathway that causes this disorder, mevalonate decarboxylase (<i>MVD</i>). They then sequenced 12 genes in the mevalonate and isoprenoid pathways in 134 index cases and provide evidence that mutations inactivating 3 more genes in the pathway (<i>PMVK</i>, <i>MVD</i> and <i>FDPS</i>) also cause this disease. Collectively, implicated variants in the 4 genes identified explain disease in 98% of familial cases and 73% of apparently sporadic cases. They also provide evidence for correlation between the underlying gene and selected aspects of clinical presentation."

Although this represents an important advance in the molecular characterization of this disorder, and further implicates and refines the disrupted pathway, the paper does not provide sufficient mechanistic insights to warrant publication in <i>eLife</i> and without such data is better suited for a subspecialty journal. How do defects in mevalonate metabolism cause the keratinization defects \u2013 toxic intermediary metabolites vs. deficiency of metabolic end-products? Most individuals were heterozygous for a mutation. Since the genes all encode enzymes, is there a mutation in the normal allele, or possibly in another allele in the pathway, in the skin lesions? Providing data to address any one of these questions would suffice."

Therefore, we deleted this sentence in our revised manuscript. All 73 sporadic cases were adult and collected during the past 10 years, which could have been used for confirmation. Most of them lived separately with their parents and were out of touch with us for years. We didn\u2019t examine those parents and get no informed consent and no peripheral blood from them.

Actually, it is a puzzle that why the patients with MA and HIGDS do not show PK. From the database of hereditary auto-inflammatory disorders mutations, c.417dupC and c.604G&gt;A in <i>MVK</i> were both reported in HIDS and PK. As for those heterozygous parents, the possible reason was that pediatricians and rheumatologists might neglect to examine their skin, since they were not familiar with porokeratosis."

Therefore, the somatic loss of function, but not somatic deletion, of the wild allele in skin lesions should be common."
