However, the mapping process is complicated by the fact that eukaryotic genomes are normally packaged inside a macromolecular complex called chromatin, which is found in the cell nucleus. The basic building block of chromatin is a structure called a nucleosome, which consists of about 150 base pairs of DNA wrapped around proteins called histones (<a href=\"#bib1\">Campos and Reinberg, 2009</a>). The most popular technique for mapping protein\u2013DNA interactions is called ChIP, which is short for chromatin immunoprecipitation."

In X-ChIP the protein-DNA interactions are frozen in place (by using formaldehyde to form crosslinks between them; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and the chromatin is fragmented by sonication and made soluble. Antibodies are then used to physically separate the chromatin fragments that contain the protein of interest from those that do not, so that the DNA in these fragments can be identified. In native ChIP, the freezing-in-place (crosslinking) step is skipped and the chromatin is fragmented by an enzyme called micrococcal nuclease (MNase; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The DNA obtained by X-ChIP or native ChIP can be identified using microarrays (ChIP-chip) or deep sequencing techniques (ChIP-seq; <a href=\"#bib4\">Johnson et al., 2007</a>). The final results are maps spanning the entire genome and studded with peaks and valleys that represent the presence and absence of a given protein at each genomic locus."

Now, in eLife, Peter Skene and Steven Henikoff of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center report that they have developed a new technique called \u2018cleavage under targets and release using nuclease\u2019 (CUT&amp;RUN;) that has the potential to overcome the limitations of X-ChIP (<a href=\"#bib8\">Skene and Henikoff, 2017</a>)."

However, unlike native ChIP, the antibodies are not used to physically separate wanted from unwanted chromatin fragments (which\u00a0is\u00a0one of the sources of noise in ChIP); instead, CUT&amp;RUN; uses the antibodies to guide the cutting activity of the MNase enzyme to the protein of interest while the\u00a0latter is still bound to intact chromatin. This means that only nearby DNA is cut into small fragments; because of their size, these fragments of DNA float out of the nuclei (leaving the rest of the uncut genome behind) and can be identified by deep sequencing. Therefore, a significant advantage of CUT&amp;RUN; is that it does not require the use of strong chemicals or sonication and that\u00a0the\u00a0nuclease only cuts\u00a0the DNA in the region of interest,\u00a0thus minimizing the noise from unwanted chromatin regions. Skene and Henikoff borrowed this idea from an older technique called chromatin immunocleavage (ChIC; <a href=\"#bib7\">Schmid et al., 2004</a>) but adapted it to native nuclei and modernized it for the sequencing age."

The maps obtained through CUT&RUN had a higher dynamic range and recovered a larger fraction of \u2018true positives\u2019 (sites containing short DNA sequences recognized by each protein). Skene and Henikoff were also able to modify CUT&RUN to study poorly soluble complexes by extracting all the DNA from the nuclei and only sequencing fragments below a certain size limit, which were specifically generated by the antibody-guided MNase enzyme. Due to lower sample and sequencing requirements, CUT&RUN might be applicable to a number of real-world situations, where cost and sample availability are often an issue."

For example, it is not clear if CUT&amp;RUN; can be applied to samples in which it is not possible to isolate the nuclei of the cells; this could include some fresh tissue samples and many samples that have been fixed and then frozen. Moreover, like X-ChIP, CUT&amp;RUN; has the disadvantage that in addition to cleaving DNA in the target region, the nuclease also cleaves DNA that is far away from the target region in sequence space, but close in real space because of the three-dimensional structure of the DNA. To distinguish between these direct and indirect targets, Skene and Henikoff compared CUT&amp;RUN; maps with those obtained with their native ChIP protocol (<a href=\"#bib5\">Kasinathan et al., 2014</a>), which only detects direct targets. However, this two-pronged approach can be labor intensive and CUT&amp;RUN; would be even more useful if it could be modified to only detect DNA directly bound to the protein of interest."
