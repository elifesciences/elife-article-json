                    "text": "The role of specific phospholipids (PLs) in lipid transport has been difficult to assess due to an inability to selectively manipulate membrane composition in vivo. Here we show that the phospholipid remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3) is a critical determinant of triglyceride (TG) secretion due to its unique ability to catalyze the incorporation of arachidonate into membranes. Mice lacking <i>Lpcat3</i> in the intestine fail to thrive during weaning and exhibit enterocyte lipid accumulation and reduced plasma TGs. Mice lacking <i>Lpcat3</i> in the liver show reduced plasma TGs, hepatosteatosis, and secrete lipid-poor very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lacking arachidonoyl PLs. Mechanistic studies indicate that Lpcat3 activity impacts membrane lipid mobility in living cells, suggesting a biophysical basis for the requirement of arachidonoyl PLs in lipidating lipoprotein particles. These data identify Lpcat3 as a key factor in lipoprotein production and illustrate how manipulation of membrane composition can be used as a regulatory mechanism to control metabolic pathways."

Here we show that the phospholipid remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3) is a critical determinant of triglyceride (TG) secretion due to its unique ability to catalyze the incorporation of arachidonate into membranes. Mice lacking <i>Lpcat3</i> in the intestine fail to thrive during weaning and exhibit enterocyte lipid accumulation and reduced plasma TGs. Mice lacking <i>Lpcat3</i> in the liver show reduced plasma TGs, hepatosteatosis, and secrete lipid-poor very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lacking arachidonoyl PLs. Mechanistic studies indicate that Lpcat3 activity impacts membrane lipid mobility in living cells, suggesting a biophysical basis for the requirement of arachidonoyl PLs in lipidating lipoprotein particles. These data identify Lpcat3 as a key factor in lipoprotein production and illustrate how manipulation of membrane composition can be used as a regulatory mechanism to control metabolic pathways."

In mammalian cells PLs synthesized de novo undergo further remodeling through deacylation by phospholipases and the subsequent and reacylation by lysophospholipid acyltransferases (Lpcats). Membrane PLs ultimately reach an equilibrium in which the majority of PL species contain a saturated acyl chain at the <i>sn</i>-1 position and an unsaturated chain at the <i>sn-</i>2 position. The Lpcat-dependent remodeling process is essential for the diversity and asymmetric distribution of acyl chains because the de novo PL synthesis pathway has little substrate specificity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Yamashita et al., 2014</a>)."

LXR controls the expression of Lpcat3, which is the most abundant Lpcat family member in liver and intestine. Cell-based assays suggest that Lpcat3 preferentially catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) species containing an unsaturated fatty acyl chain at the sn-2 position (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hishikawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>), but the importance of Lpcat3 activity for membrane PL composition in vivo remains to be established. We found that acute overexpression or knockdown of Lpcat3 in cultured cells or mouse liver altered the distribution of PL species, particularly those containing unsaturated fatty acyl chains (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rong et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, we showed that the ability of the LXR-Lpcat3 pathway to promote unsaturation of membrane lipids was protective against ER stress and inflammation in the setting of cellular lipid excess. However, the in vivo relevance of LXR-dependent modulation of endogenous PL composition for systemic lipid homeostasis was unclear."

It has been reported that modifications of PL composition influence a range of cellular processes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Holzer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Pinot et al., 2014</a>). However, most analyses of the consequences of altered PL fatty acyl composition have been performed in purified membrane systems or have involved treating cells with high levels of exogenous lipids. Such experimental manipulations are unlikely to accurately model physiologic perturbations in membrane composition. The recognition that Lpcat3 activity can be regulated by cellular lipid status through LXRs raises the possibility that Lpcat3 activity could contribute to some of the well-documented effects of LXR on systemic lipid homeostasis."

PC is the major PL component of lipoproteins (<a href=\"#bib2\">\u00c5gren et al., 2005</a>). It has been reported that active PC de novo synthesis is necessary for the biogenesis and/or secretion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) from hepatocytes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Vance, 2008</a>). However, impaired de novo PC synthesis impacts all the PC species and reduces the total PC content of cellular membranes. Whether a specific PC species is selectively required for hepatocyte lipoprotein production is unclear. In the intestine, it has been proposed that PC may enhance lipid uptake by enterocytes and/or promote chylomicron assembly and secretion (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tso et al., 1977</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Voshol et al., 2000</a>). Luminal PC is not absorbed intact, but is hydrolyzed into lysophosphatidylcholine (Lyso-PC) in the lumen and subsequently re-acylated within enterocytes by Lpcat enzymes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Nilsson, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Parthasarathy et al., 1974</a>). The mechanistic role of specific PL species in lipid transport and lipoprotein production has been difficult to address due to an inability to selectively manipulate membrane PL composition in vivo. Interestingly, the LXR pathway has been reported to promote hepatic triglyceride (TG) secretion by the liver (<a href=\"#bib23\">Okazaki et al., 2010</a>).

We also show that induction of Lpcat3 activity is required for the ability of LXRs to promote hepatic VLDL production. These data identify Lpcat3-dependent phospholipid remodeling as a critical, LXR-regulated step in TG secretion, and suggest that this step might be further explored as a strategy to treat hyperlipidemias."

We showed previously that hepatic <i>Lpcat3</i> expression is regulated by the sterol-activated nuclear receptor LXR (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rong et al., 2013</a>). Here, we showed that intestinal Lpcat3 expression is strongly responsive to the administration of a synthetic LXR-agonist, GW3965 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To address whether Lpcat3 activity may also be important for TG metabolism in intestinal enterocytes, we generated intestine-specific Lpcat3 KO mice (I-Lpcat3 KO) by crossing the floxed mice to villin-<i>Cre</i> transgenics. I-Lpcat3 KO mice were born at the predicted Mendelian frequency, and their body weights at birth were comparable to controls (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). However, even though the pups suckled, they failed to thrive and showed severe growth retardation by 1 week of age (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Expression of <i>Lpcat3</i> was reduced more than 90% in duodenum of I-Lpcat3 KO mice as expected, and there was no compensatory increase in expression of <i>Lpcat1</i>, <i>Lpcat2</i> or <i>Lpcat4</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Blood glucose levels in 1-week-old I-Lpcat3 pups were very low (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), consistent with results obtained with global knockouts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Plasma insulin levels were also correspondingly reduced. Plasma TG levels were lower and total cholesterol and NEFA levels were unchanged in I-Lpcat3 KO pups (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Histological analysis of intestines from I-Lpcat3 KO pups revealed a dramatic accumulation of cytosolic lipid droplets in intestinal enterocytes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), a phenotype reminiscent of intestinal apoB-deficient mice. Analysis of intestinal gene expression in I-Lpcat3 KO mice revealed reduced expression of several genes linked to intestinal TG metabolism, including <i>Apob</i>, <i>Cd36</i>, <i>Dgat2</i>, and <i>Mogat2</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Given the massive enterocyte lipid accumulation in enterocytes, it is conceivable that some of those gene-expression changes were due, at least in part, to poor nutrition or cell toxicity. Nevertheless, these data were consistent with a role for Lpcat3 in TG mobilization and secretion\u2013in the intestine as well as in the liver."

Previous studies using in vitro systems have profiled the substrate specificities of the four mammalian Lpcat family members (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hishikawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). These studies suggested that Lpcat3 exhibited a preference for LysoPC and polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates. Consistent with those results, we previously observed subtle changes in the levels of PC species containing polyunsaturated acyl in response to acute Lpcat3 knockdown in hepatocytes and macrophages (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rong et al., 2013</a>). However, the consequences of a genetic inactivation of <i>Lpcat3</i> for membrane composition in vivo have never been addressed. Unexpectedly, analysis of phospholipid species in whole liver extracts from L-Lpcat3 KO mice by ESI-MS/MS revealed that Lpcat3 activity is uniquely required for the incorporation of arachidonate chains into PLs. Thus, despite the fact that Lpcat3 can catalyze the esterification of multiple unsaturated acyl chains into PC in vitro, and despite the fact that Lpcat3 is by far the most abundant Lpcat family member in the liver, the consequences of loss of Lpcat3 for PL composition were remarkably selective. The total level of PC was not different between L-Lpcat3 KO and control livers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). However, there were striking reductions (\u223c70%) in the abundance of 16:0, 20:4 PC and 18:0, 20:4 PC (nomenclature: a:b, c:d; where a and c are the number of carbons and b and d are the number of double bonds of the sn-1 and sn-2 aliphatic groups, respectively), two of the most abundant arachidonoyl PC species in liver membranes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). However, the actual reduction of 16:0, 20:4 PC and 18:0, 20:4 PCs in <i>hepatocyte</i> membranes was almost certainly much greater, given that a significant fraction of membranes in total liver extracts originate from other cell types (where Lpcat3 activity is preserved). Furthermore, we observed compensatory increases in the abundance of other PC species in L-Lpcat3 KO livers, notably those containing monounsaturated chains (e.g., 16:0, 18:1 PC and 18:0, 18:1 PC; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

These data are consistent with our earlier study showing that adenoviral expression of Lpcat3 is protective against hepatic inflammation in the setting of lipid excess (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rong et al., 2013</a>). We validated the microarray results for a number of genes by real-time PCR and also assessed the expression of other genes relevant to lipoprotein production (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). Importantly, there was no change in the expression of mRNAs encoding apoB or of the critical lipid transfer protein MTTP in livers of Lpcat3 KO mice, indicating that altered plasma TG levels cannot be attributed to changes in expression of these factors."

Laurdan is a fluorescent lipophilic molecule that can be used to detect changes in membrane dynamics due to its sensitivity to the polarity of the membrane environment. Changes in membrane dynamics shift the laurdan emission spectrum, which can be quantified by the generalized polarization (GP) calculated from the spectrum shifts (<a href=\"#bib24\">Parasassi et al., 1990</a>). We isolated primary hepatocytes from L-Lpcat3 KO mice and controls, stained with laurdan, and monitored fluorescence in live cells by microscopy. A visual representation of the calculated GP intensity is presented in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>, and the data are quantitated in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>. The prominent increase in GP (as shown by the yellow/orange pseudocolor signal) in cells lacking Lpcat3 is indicative of areas of cellular membrane with reduced dynamics. These data show that membranes are less dynamic, and their component lipids move less readily, in the absence of Lpcat3, an observation that is consistent with the reduced amount of arachidonate groups in membrane PLs. We propose that efficient transfer of bulk TG to nascent VLDL particles is enabled by the presence of arachidonoyl PLs in the ER/Golgi membrane due to its unique ability to facilitate optimal lipid movement and membrane dynamics."

However, assessing the physiological impact of changing the abundance of individual PL species in animals has been a difficult experimental problem. Our study identifies Lpcat3 as a critical determinant of the abundance of arachidonoyl PLs in mice. The largely preserved levels of other PL species containing polyunsaturated chains in Lpcat3-deficient livers suggests that other Lpcats may be able to catalyze the incorporation of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids into membranes in the absence of Lpcat3. However, Lpcat3 is apparently unique in its ability to catalyze arachidonoyl PL synthesis.

These models exhibit reduced total apoB protein in plasma as well as lower plasma TGs, suggesting that adequate PC biosynthesis is important for both apoB secretion and VLDL lipidation. In our study, mice lacking Lpcat3 retain the ability to secrete apoB and are capable of producing small poorly-lipidated VLDL particles. However, they are unable to transfer TG to lipoproteins at an appropriate rate in the setting of increased metabolic demand. Our results suggest that the reduced availability of arachidonoyl PLs becomes especially problematic when there is a need to mobilize a large bolus of TG into lipoproteins. For example, when L-Lpcat3 KO mice are challenged with the lipogenic sucrose diet, they are unable to efficiently mobilize the newly synthesized TG into plasma lipoproteins and it instead accumulates in cytosolic lipid droplets in the liver."

Our observations suggest that Lpcat3 and its lipid products are likely not essential for the cotranslational lipidation of apoB and the generation of primordial VLDL particles (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fisher and Ginsberg, 2002</a>). However, the small size of plasma VLDL particles, together with the reduced TG-rich apoB-containing particles in the Golgi fraction of L-Lpcat3 KO livers, strongly suggest that Lpcat3 impacts the second step of VLDL assembly\u2013bulk TG addition to lipid-poor apoB particles and the generation of mature VLDL. TG-rich VLDL assembly is highly dependent on the efficient trafficking of stored cytosolic lipid from lipid droplets or newly synthesized lipid to primordial VLDL particles. One factor that could affect this transfer is the membrane environment where the bulk lipidation occurs. Although the precise mechanism that links membrane PL composition and VLDL lipidation is not clear, biophysical studies suggested that greater lipid transport is generally observed with more fluid and highly curved membrane surfaces (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lev, 2012</a>)."

However, detailing these biophysical changes and elucidating how they influence lipid movement will require further study with specialized tools and systems. Nevertheless, our data suggest that membrane dynamics may play an important role in VLDL lipidation in vivo. Interestingly, a recent proteomic study identified Lpcat3 as a component of the VLDL transport vesicle, indicating that Lpcat3 travels with primordial VLDL particles as they bud from the ER and move to the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib29\">Rahim et al., 2012</a>). Together with prior work, our data favor a model in which Lpcat3 modifies the arachidonoyl-PC composition of both membranes and lipoprotein particles during VLDL assembly, thereby generating a local membrane environment that facilitates lipid transport and bulk lipidation."

A model for Lpcat3 action is presented in <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>. Lpcat3 is not only a required component of lipoprotein production; it is also a regulated one. The fact that Lpcat3 expression is dynamically regulated by LXRs in liver and intestine strongly suggests that the level of Lpcat3 enzymatic activity has evolved to respond to dietary and metabolic demands. LXR is transcriptionally activated as cellular cholesterol levels rise. Thus, the LXR-Lpcat3 pathway provides a mechanism to integrate sterol metabolism and membrane PL composition. We speculate that Lpcat3 expression is induced in response to lipid loading in order to increase ER/Golgi membrane flexibility and to facilitate efficient TG secretion (thereby unloading cells of excess lipids). In support of this idea, we found that the ability of pharmacologic LXR agonist to stimulate hepatic VLDL production was impaired in the genetic absence of Lpcat3."

                        "text": "Finally, these studies open the door to new strategies for pharmacologic intervention in systemic lipid metabolism. Abnormal phospholipid metabolism has been associated with several metabolic diseases. For example, lower amounts of polyunsaturated PLs have been observed in liver biopsies from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients (<a href=\"#bib28\">Puri et al., 2007</a>), and cell membranes from patients with atherosclerotic disease tend to show decreased membrane fluidity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 1995</a>). However, it has heretofore been difficult to draw a causal link between aberrant PL composition and the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. Our studies provide direct evidence that alterations in arachidonoyl PC abundance impair lipoprotein metabolism in liver and intestine in vivo. Recently, a human GWAS reported a highly significant association between <i>LPCAT3</i> and the phospholipid composition of red blood cell membranes, indicating that Lpcat3 is also a key regulator of phospholipid composition in humans (<a href=\"#bib34\">Tintle et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, an improved understanding of the mechanisms by which Lpcat3 and arachidonoyl PCs regulate lipid homeostasis could lead to new approaches to metabolic diseases. We speculate that small molecule inhibitors of Lpcat3 could be of potential utility for lowering plasma lipid levels in hyperlipidemic individuals. In pursuing such a strategy, one would need to monitor the impact of Lpcat3 inhibition on liver TG stores, hepatic inflammation and lipid malabsorption, in addition to the plasma lipids. However, modest increases in liver TG stores, even if they occurred in humans, might not doom such a strategy. Inhibiting apoB synthesis with antisense compounds has found a place in the management of some cases of hyperlipidemia, despite modest increases in liver TG stores."

Spectral data were acquired with a Zeiss LSM710 META laser scanning microscope coupled to a 2-photon Ti:Sapphire laser (Mai Tai, Spectra Physics, Newport Beach, CA) producing 80-fs pulses at a repetition of 80 MHz with two different filters: 460/80 nm for the blue channel and 540/50 nm for the green channel. Spectral data were processed by the SimFCS software (Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics). The GP value was calculated for each pixel using the two Laurdan intensity images (460/80 nm and 540/50 nm). The GP value of each pixel was used to generate the pseudocolored GP image. GP distributions were obtained from the histograms of the GP images."

Briefly, fresh liver tissue was homogenized with a motor driven Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in homogenization buffer (37.5 mM TRIS-maleate, pH 7.4; 0.5 M sucrose; 1% dextran; and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). After an initial centrifugation at 5000\u00d7<i>g</i> for 15 min, most of the supernatant was removed and the yellow-brown portion (approximately the upper one-third) of the pellet was suspended in homogenization buffer, layered over 2.7 ml of 1.2 M sucrose and spin for 30 min at 100,000\u00d7<i>g</i> in a swinging bucket rotor (SW50.1). The Golgi fraction was collected at the buffer/1.2 M sucrose interface. The Golgi was suspended in distilled water and pelleted by centrifugation at 5500\u00d7<i>g</i> for 20 min. Aliquots of the Golgi fraction were used to measure TG and protein concentration. Golgi apoB was analyzed as described (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gusarova et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Li et al., 2012</a>). Briefly, the luminal contents were released from Golgi fraction by treatment with 0.1 M sodium carbonate (pH 11) and deoxycholic acid (0.025%) for 30 min at room temperature. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, followed by centrifugation (50,000 rpm in a Beckman SW60 rotor for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C) to remove membranes. The luminal contents (supernatant) were adjusted to pH 7.4 with acetic acid, adjusted to a sucrose concentration of 12.5% (wt/vol), and placed on the top of a step gradient consisting of 1.9 ml of 49% sucrose and 1.9 ml of 20% sucrose. Next, 2.8 ml of PBS was layered on the top of the supernatants. All solutions contained protease inhibitors. After centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 65 hr at 10\u00b0C in a Beckman SW41 rotor, 12 fractions with densities ranging from 1.0 to 1.125 g/ml were collected from the top of the tube. ApoB protein from each fraction was analyzed by western blotting."

We do not see prominent induction of ER stress responses in the Lpcat3 KO mice, and we believe that this is related to the difference between the experimental approaches (acute Lpcat3 knockdown vs genetic deletion). We have now added this data to the revised manuscript. We point out that we do in fact observe increased inflammation in the Lpcat3 KO mice in the setting of western diet feeding, and these data are included in the paper. The fact that the lipoprotein production defect is observed in the absence of inflammation (e.g. on chow diet), supports the conclusion that this defect is not secondary to inflammatory changes."
