MNase-seq methods have been widely applied to characterize nucleosome organization in vivo, but generally lack the accuracy to determine the precise nucleosome positions. Here we develop a computational approach leveraging digestion variability to determine nucleosome positions at a base-pair resolution from MNase-seq data. We generate a variability template as a simple error model for how MNase digestion affects the mapping of individual nucleosomes. Applied to both yeast and human cells, this analysis reveals that alternatively positioned nucleosomes are prevalent and create significant heterogeneity in a cell population. We show that the periodic occurrences of dinucleotide sequences relative to nucleosome dyads can be directly determined from genome-wide nucleosome positions from MNase-seq. Alternatively positioned nucleosomes near transcription start sites likely represent different states of promoter nucleosomes during transcription initiation. Our method can be applied to map nucleosome positions in diverse organisms at base-pair resolution."

MNase-seq methods have been widely applied to characterize nucleosome organization in vivo, but generally lack the accuracy to determine the precise nucleosome positions. Here we develop a computational approach leveraging digestion variability to determine nucleosome positions at a base-pair resolution from MNase-seq data. We generate a variability template as a simple error model for how MNase digestion affects the mapping of individual nucleosomes. Applied to both yeast and human cells, this analysis reveals that alternatively positioned nucleosomes are prevalent and create significant heterogeneity in a cell population. We show that the periodic occurrences of dinucleotide sequences relative to nucleosome dyads can be directly determined from genome-wide nucleosome positions from MNase-seq. Alternatively positioned nucleosomes near transcription start sites likely represent different states of promoter nucleosomes during transcription initiation. Our method can be applied to map nucleosome positions in diverse organisms at base-pair resolution."

Recently, a chemical cleavage approach that uses a genetically engineered histone H4 to chemically cleave DNA sequences in contact with the nucleosome dyad allowed direct measurement of nucleosome positions with unprecedented resolution (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brogaard et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2013</a>). However, the requirement for genetic engineering of essential histones limits its current application to genetically tractable organisms. Therefore, novel experimental or analytical approaches that are generally applicable in eukaryotes are still needed to determine the accurate positions of nucleosomes in vivo. Here, we report a computational approach to determine in vivo nucleosome positions from paired-end MNase-sequencing data."

For example, in super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, the locations of individual fluorophores within the diffraction limit of light can be identified by deconvoluting light intensity information with a function describing the distribution of light intensity from individual light spots (<a href=\"#bib4\">Betzig et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Huang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rust et al., 2006</a>). Inspired by this, we use the size distribution of MNase digested nucleosome fragments to infer a digestion variability template for nucleosomes, and report a Bayesian method that makes use of these templates to identify the individual positions of nucleosomes at a base-pair resolution, hereafter referred to as the template-based Bayesian (TBB) approach. This approach can be applied to data generated through both paired-end and single-end sequencing to map chromatin structure in diverse organisms. Here we demonstrate the template-based Bayesian approach with paired-end sequencing of MNase digested nucleosomes in yeast and human cells. We show that the periodic occurrences of dinucleotide sequence motifs relative to the nucleosome dyad can be directly determined from MNase based nucleosome positions and are conserved in vivo\u00a0in both yeast and human cells. Leveraging this method, we find that alternative configurations of nucleosomes are a common feature in both yeast and human chromatin. The alternatively positioned nucleosomes around gene transcription start sites represent configurations that differ in their compatibility with the assembly of the pre-initiation complex. A 3-step model for transcription initiation can reconcile the competition between nucleosomes and the transcriptional machinery observed from genomic analysis."

Since the overall digestion of nucleosomes is reflected in the length of nucleosomal DNA fragments, we tested the idea that we might be able to estimate the variation in the midpoints from the length of digested nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and use this information to infer the positions of individual nucleosomes through deconvolution. The variability of digested nucleosomes could come from two sources: the technical variation that is associated with nuclease cleavage, such as variable trimming at nucleosome ends, and biological variation that directly influences the length of DNA wound around histones, such as nucleosome breathing and remodeling (<a href=\"#bib40\">Polach and Widom, 1995</a>). While the technical effects are likely to affect both ends of nucleosomal DNA equally, the biological effects may create bias for specific nucleosomes and/or a specific side of the nucleosomes. However, the biological effects are generally believed to be transient and rare at a given genomic location within a population of cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andrews and Luger, 2011</a>); we thus assumed that the digestion variation was equivalent at both ends of the nucleosome when averaged over the genome and population. The biological variation at individual nucleosomes could generate large shifts in read midpoints due to length differences in nucleosomes (likely by multiples of 10 bp due to the unwrapping of each helical turn of DNA), and could be identified as alternative nucleosome positions if they were present in a significant fraction of the bulk nucleosome population. Nucleosomes with substantially smaller size, such as sub-nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rhee et al., 2014</a>), can be identified based on the sequenced fragment size (&lt;100 bp) and were excluded from our analysis."

First, we estimated the distribution of MNase digestion variability from the length distribution of DNA sequencing reads, assuming that MNase digestion is not biased towards either end of the\u00a0nucleosome on average. This produced a digestion variability template, describing the overall deviations in read midpoints relative to the true nucleosome center (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, each chromosome was segmented into regions with similar sequencing coverage to increase detection sensitivity, with a requirement to maintain sufficient segment length for estimating statistical properties of nucleosome positions. Third, within each segment, the occupancy of read midpoints (the number of paired-end read midpoints at each base pair, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, gray trace) was deconvoluted with the digestion variability template to estimate the expected read occupancy at every base pair if digestion errors had not occurred (coefficient \u03b2, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, black trace). Finally, the locations of nucleosomes were summarized based on this expected read occupancy and statistical thresholds. To control for falsely identified nucleosome positions arising from the sequence preference of MNase, we set the statistical thresholds using a false discovery rate (FDR\u22640.05) estimated based on a simulated MNase digestion dataset that matches the experimentally observed digestion sequence distribution. In our study, the length distribution of paired-end sequencing reads from the gene coding and promoter regions was indistinguishable from the rest of the genome (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s2\">2</a>).

The degree to which chromatin is digested by MNase depends on the DNA sequence and the preparation of nucleosomal DNA samples (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dingwall et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Horz and Altenburger, 1981</a>), and may differ significantly between experiments even when experimental protocols have been carefully followed. To evaluate the tolerance of the TBB nucleosome positions to different levels of MNase digestion, we compared the consensus centers and TBB nucleosome positions in the \u2018T1\u2019 and \u2018T2\u2019 data sets that represent digestion to different fragment sizes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Both the consensus centers and the TBB nucleosome positions were in agreement between these two experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure\u00a0supplements 5</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig2s6\">6</a>), with a median difference of 2 bp across the genome; in comparison, randomly generated consensus centers and nucleosome positions gave rise to a median difference of 49 bp and 36 bp, respectively. Individual nucleosome positions can be reliably detected regardless of the differences in MNase digestion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), demonstrating the robustness of the determined nucleosome positions to digestion variability. Overall, these results demonstrate that the positions of nucleosomes can be reliably and accurately detected at base-pair resolution with paired-end MNase-seq coupled with the template-based Bayesian approach."

This observation, together with our finding that overlapping positions are commonly observed in yeast and human chromatin, motivated us to examine the relationship between TSSs and overlapping nucleosome positions (resulting from alternative positions). We identified all TBB nucleosome positions that were closely associated with TSSs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jiang and Pugh, 2009a</a>) and organized them into groups consisting of either unique or overlapping TBB nucleosome positions for each gene (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). If a group contained several overlapping TBB nucleosome positions, the center of this group was defined as the numeric average of these positions. All groups were aligned at their centers and ranked by the spacing between TBB nucleosome positions within the groups (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The TBB nucleosome positions exhibited a bimodal shape for at least three quarters of the genes with nucleosome-covered TSSs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, \u2018positions\u2019), suggesting that alternative positioning is a common feature of nucleosomes near TSSs. The number of sequenced read midpoints showed the same bi-furcating shape and was highly consistent between two experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, \u2018T1 midpoints\u2019 and \u2018T2 midpoints\u2019). The occupancy of nucleosome midpoints at each gene correlated well between two experiments (T1 and T2), indicating alternative nucleosomes can be reliably observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The distribution of read midpoints was symmetric along the direction of gene transcription (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and could\u00a0not be explained by the sequence bias of MNase digestion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). When we examined the midpoints attributed to each nucleosome position within each group (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig5s2\">2</a>), we found that most groups showed less than 2-fold variation in the read occupancy between alternative TBB nucleosome positions, suggesting that the different positions are significantly represented in the cell population and therefore are likely of biological relevance. These alternative positions were not a consequence of differential digestion at nucleosome edges (<a href=\"#bib64\">Weiner et al., 2010</a>), as both ends of paired-end sequencing reads showed two peaks that match the edges of alternatively positioned nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Differential digestion at nucleosome edges would produce two peaks of read ends on one side and just one peak on the other read end (<a href=\"#bib64\">Weiner et al., 2010</a>). Of the genes with their TSSs covered by nucleosomes, approximately one quarter contain more than two TBB nucleosome positions at TSSs, suggesting that chromatin structure at the transcription initiation site is complex and heterogeneous."

Recently, it was suggested that the +1 nucleosome downstream of the TSS assists in the assembly of the PIC (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</a>). However, the binding of the PIC extends into the boundary of the +1 nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</a>), presenting a physical conflict between PIC binding and nucleosomes. To test if the resolution of alternatively positioned nucleosomes would provide a better understanding of the interplay between nucleosomes and the assembly of the PIC, we analyzed the occupancy of the PIC (determined with the ChIP-exo method (chromatin immunoprecipitation with lambda exonuclease digestion) by Rhee and Pugh [<a href=\"#bib47\">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</a>]) around the identified distal and proximal nucleosomes, respectively. Most subunits of the PIC, including TBP, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH and TFIIK, showed peak enrichment at the edge of the distally positioned nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, cyan), suggesting that the +1 nucleosome in the distal position marks a boundary for the assembly of the PIC. This boundary may be provided by the positioned nucleosomes or by binding of one or more components of the transcription complex. In contrast, the proximally positioned nucleosome covered most of the regions enriched for PIC binding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, red), suggesting that the +1 nucleosome in the proximal position is not compatible with the binding of transcription machinery. Intriguingly, TATA-box and TATA-like sequences were enriched in front of the proximal nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), suggesting that proximal nucleosomes do not block recognition of most TATA elements. Thus, the proximal nucleosome may represent a promoter state that\u00a0is\u00a0not associated with active transcription and is populated prior to the assembly of the PIC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, Proximal state). The distal nucleosome may represent a promoter state in the process of transcription initiation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, Distal state). Once transcription begins, the barrier of nucleosomes no longer hinders Pol II as its occupancy extends through the region covered by the +1 nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

With the high-precision nucleosome position maps generated by TBB, we directly demonstrated that the DNA sequences around the mapped nucleosome positions exhibited 10 bp periodicity in the frequency of dinucleotide motifs in both yeast and human cells, arguing that this sequence feature is a universal signal for positioning nucleosomes in vivo at the whole genome level."

Identifying overlapping nucleosome positions that cannot co-exist on the same DNA molecule at the same time provides a snapshot of possible chromatin states in dynamic processes. We observed at least two states of chromatin where gene transcription is initiated: a state where a nucleosome covers the transcription start site and competes with transcription machinery, but leaves the core promoter sequences mostly accessible ('proximal state'); and another state where a nucleosome barely covers the transcription start site and seems poised for the assembly of the pre-initiation complex ('distal state'). We propose a 3-step model (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) to describe the transcription initiation steps influenced by nucleosomes, including a state where RNA polymerase transcribes through the nucleosome covered sequence ('open state'). The transition from the 'proximal state' to the 'distal state' and to the 'open state' could be actively driven by the assembly of the PIC; in this case, different nucleosome states may reflect rate-limiting steps during transcription initiation. Alternatively, this transition could be controlled by transcription factors, chromatin modulators and even the preference of DNA sequences as a means to regulate and assist gene transcription. Interestingly, we found that TSSs of highly expressed genes are enriched with uniquely positioned nucleosomes, which resemble nucleosomes in their 'distal state'. It is possible that the +1 nucleosomes of these most highly expressed genes are oriented in a way that allows constitutive assembly of the PIC and therefore frequent transcription activity. Further genomic analysis and mechanistic studies will shed light on the generalization and the underlying principles of this model."

Unique nucleosome positions may result from the combination of the strong nucleosome boundary signal from poly(dA:dT) sequences and the lack of a rotational positioning signal from periodic dinucleotide motifs. Conversely, alternatively positioned nucleosomes may be a consequence of a weak boundary signal and a strong rotational positioning signal that allows nucleosomes to interconvert between multiple equivalent positions. The exact positions of these nucleosomes and how alternative nucleosomes are positioned relative to each other may be further controlled by other factors associated with promoters, such as chromatin modifiers, remodelers and transcription factors. The configurations of nucleosomes (unique vs. alternative) may influence the transcription of a gene; if promoter DNA sequences contain information that helps to specify the nucleosome configurations, eukaryotic genome could use nucleosome configurations as\u00a0a means to encode transcriptional programs."

Revealing these heterogeneous configurations of nucleosomes in cells will provide new insights into how chromatin regulates or is influenced by biological processes. Furthermore, mutually exclusive positions of protein-DNA complexes can imply dynamic information. As an example, the alternatively positioned nucleosomes at TSSs suggest a change in chromatin structure during transcription initiation. Similar analytic approaches can be applied to other systems to reconstruct dynamic processes."

This digestion variability reflects a combination of factors that influences the size of protected nucleosomal DNA, such as over- or under- digestion of intact nucleosomes. This estimation was based on a simple, symmetric model of MNase digestion for each sequenced fragment. Using this model, we obtained a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the distribution of digestion variability (<i>e</i>) at each end of a sequenced fragment (<i>e<sub>1j</sub></i>, <i>e<sub>2j</sub></i>). Therefore, we can infer the digestion variability template as the distribution of the variability in paired-end read midpoints due to digestion.

This was done to control for local variation in sequencing coverage and nucleosome occupancy, allowing for efficient estimation of local structure with minimal sensitivity to distant observations. To accomplish this, we started from ORFs and refined these natural demarcations into a statistically useful segmentation. We first enumerated all open reading frames (ORFs) and intergenic regions on each given chromosome. Merging overlapping ORFs into single segments yielded a starting set of contiguous, non-overlapping segments. We then iteratively merged the most similar short segments until all segments exceed a minimal length (800 bp). The similarity was defined based on sequencing read midpoints per base pair within each segment. This yielded a segmentation for which each segment has sufficient length to estimate local properties of the nucleosome position distribution. For the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> genome, we obtained a total of 5135 segments for our T1 experiment with a mean segment length of 2351 bp (minimum length of 800 bp and maximum length of 14,499 bp). The results on the T2 experiment were extremely similar with 5118 segments and a mean length of 2359 bp. This segmentation was fixed and used in all subsequent computation. The region of human chromosome 12, position 38,000,000 bp to 48,000,000 bp was segmented based on the annotated introns and exons of human genome hg18 (Roche, NimbleGen). Other segmentation techniques based on the biological structure of each chromosome can be used and may be more appropriate for mammalian genomes."

In the second method, we took into account the spacing features between TBB nucleosome positions or consensus centers. In this way, the randomly generated genomic coordinates and the experimental determined data have the same distribution of spacing between adjacent positions. The random nucleosome positions or consensus centers maps generated by these two methods yielded similar results and only the result of the second method is shown in the plots (Gray trace, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig2s5\">5</a>). The median distance between the random nucleosome positions and the chemical positions is 18 bp, and is 36 bp for the spacing between the random nucleosome positions and the TBB positions determined here. The median distance between the random consensus centers and either the reference centers or the consensus centers determined here is 49 bp in both cases.

We thus performed a set of in silico experiments to evaluate the performance of the TBB method in a setting where ground truth of nucleosome positions is available. We first simulated the true positions of nucleosomes: we generated the primary nucleosome positions to represent the most frequent (strongest) positions among a set of overlapping nucleosomes, and then added alternative positions around the primary positions to account for the other overlapping nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In each set of in silico experiments, we systematically varied the occupancy (coverage), spacing (offset), and relative strength of primary and alternative nucleosome positions (effective magnitude) according to a factorial design that spans the 5th to 95th percentiles of the corresponding properties observed in our yeast experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). At each of the simulated nucleosome positions, we randomly generated sequencing reads based on the digestion variability template estimated from T1, and constructed 10 artificial chromosomes to represent the in silico MNase-seq data sets. The occupancy of sequencing read midpoints in these simulated data sets resembles that determined from our biological samples. We then applied the TBB approach to identify nucleosome positions in these in silico data sets and compared them with the simulated nucleosome positions (both simulated primary and alternative positions). We found that the TBB approach can reliably identify primary nucleosome positions (50% and 85% of the primary positions within 2 bp and 4 bp, respectively) across all settings. Detection of the alternative positions is similarly reliable (50% and 75% within ~3 bp and ~7 bp, respectively) if the alternative positions are populated at least 1/3 as frequently as the nearest primary positions (effective magnitude smaller than 0.6) (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Detailed methods and discussion about the in silico validation can be found in Extended Experimental Procedures."

The in vivo organization of nucleosomes around genes was determined from the identified consensus centers from the T1 experiment and averaged across all ORFs. As traditionally annotated, the nucleosomes after the TSS were numbered incrementally from +1, and the nucleosomes before TSS were numbered decrementally from \u22121. The average positions of these nucleosomes relative to TSSs were used in the construction the simulated nucleosome positions. Meanwhile, the number of sequencing reads within each consensus position was used to simulate the in silico MNase-seq datasets."

We reported both the average centers of bulk nucleosomes as well the positions of individual nucleosomes. Parameters used in the model are inferred directly from experimental datasets. In comparison, the Parzen window-based methods, as used by Albert et al. (2007), Valouev et al. (2008), Tsankov et al., (2010) and many others, estimate the peak of smoothed nucleosome occupancy along relatively broad nucleosome-containing regions. The number and locations of nucleosomes are highly dependent on smoothing window widths that are defined by users. Weiner et al. (2010) proposed a template-based filtering approach to deal with variable nucleosome sizes and fuzzy digestion ends. However, it cannot provide fine-grained mapping of overlapping nucleosome positions. The NOrMAL method developed by Polishko et al. (2012) is a recent method with improved identification of non-overlapping nucleosome positions compared with previous methods, but still depends on user defined parameters and cannot map positions of individual nucleosomes. In a separate simulation analysis, we described a direct comparison between the performance of NOrMAL and the performance of the template-based Bayesian method (Blocker and Airoldi 2016, Section 4). The TBB method outperforms NOrMAL in all the settings we have considered. We conclude that our work provides the best resolution and most accurate method to identify positions of individual nucleosomes from MNase-seq data."

We cannot conclude whether overlapping nucleosome positions identified from these datasets originate from differences between cell lines or mechanisms related to gene regulation.
