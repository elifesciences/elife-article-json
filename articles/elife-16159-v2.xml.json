Connections to this spindle are mediated by sister kinetochore pairs, that form dynamic end-on attachments to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles. This bi-orientation generates forces that have been reported to stretch the kinetochore itself, which has been suggested to stabilise attachment and silence the spindle checkpoint. We reveal using three dimensional tracking that the outer kinetochore domain can swivel around the inner kinetochore/centromere, which results in large reductions in intra-kinetochore distance (delta) when viewed in lower dimensions. We show that swivel provides a mechanical flexibility that enables kinetochores at the periphery of the spindle to engage microtubules. Swivel reduces as cells approach anaphase, suggesting an organisational change linked to checkpoint satisfaction and/or obligatory changes in kinetochore mechanochemistry may occur before dissolution of sister chromatid cohesion."

Kinetochores mediate this attachment, and harness the pushing and pulling forces associated with microtubule polymerisation/depolymerisation to power chromosome movement (<a href=\"#bib19\">Rago and Cheeseman, 2013</a>). Extensive biochemical work has assembled a detailed parts list for the kinetochore and we now understand that the core structure assembles in a hierarchical fashion with the CCAN (constitutive centromere associated network) physically bridging CENP-A containing chromatin and the microtubule-binding KMN network (KNL1, MIS12 and NDC80 complexes) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Pesenti et al., 2016</a>). Multiple copies of each component (<a href=\"#bib21\">Suzuki et al., 2015</a>) produce a supramolecular disk-shaped assembly with a (metaphase) diameter of ~200 nm and a depth of ~100 nm (<a href=\"#bib20\">Rieder and Salmon, 1998</a>)."

The distance between the spot\u00a0centres is the \u201c<i>intra-kinetochore distance</i> (delta; \u0394)\u201d (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Removing microtubule-pulling forces in both human and Drosophila cells has been shown to reduce the distance between centromeric chromatin and the microtubule-binding outer layer of the kinetochore by ~30 nm (<a href=\"#bib25\">Wan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Maresca and Salmon, 2009</a>). This is interpreted as\u00a0evidence\u00a0of tension within the kinetochore generated by microtubule pulling, an event that has been linked to how kinetochores stabilise correct microtubule attachments and silence the spindle assembly checkpoint (<a href=\"#bib11\">Joglekar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Maresca and Salmon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Uchida et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Drpic et al., 2015</a>). However, the requirement for this intra-kinetochore tension in the checkpoint silencing mechanism has recently been challenged (<a href=\"#bib9\">Etemad et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Tauchman et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Magidson et al., 2016</a>)."

As previously found (<a href=\"#bib21\">Suzuki et al., 2015</a>) the majority of CENP-C amino-termini are 'free' and in close proximity of the centromere, rather than directly bound to the 20\u00a0nm long MIS12 complex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Petrovic et al., 2014</a>). The orientation of the NDC80 complex is suggested based on the 60\u00a0nm length of the complex and the flexibility in the hinge region (<a href=\"#bib27\">Wei et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wang et al., 2008</a>).

Moreover, following bi-orientation \u0394 does not increase or decrease as the inter-sister distance increases (the latter is known to vary under the forces acting on kinetochores during metaphase oscillations) suggesting that the kinetochore is now non-compliant (<a href=\"#bib22\">Suzuki et al., 2014</a>). One possible explanation for these differences is the reliance on 1D or 2D measurement of the 3D movement of kinetochores within the spindle, while fixation conditions and the tilting of the kinetochore have also been found to have effects on \u0394 measurements (<a href=\"#bib13\">Magidson et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Wan et al., 2009</a>).

We confirmed that kinetochore dynamics were normal following exogenous expression of Ndc80-tagRFP (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). The 3D Euclidean distance \u0394\u00a0between eGFP and tagRFP spot centres (\u0394<sub>3D</sub>) for sister kinetochore pairs in live cells was estimated to be 98.0 (\u00b1 0.9) nm (n = 4291; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Unlike in PtK2 cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dumont et al., 2012</a>) we did not detect a difference between away-from-the-pole (AP) and poleward (P) moving kinetochores in either 3D (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) or 2D measurements (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Our 3D measurement is somewhat larger than the ~60 nm predicted from previous measurements of CENP-A-to-Spc24 distance (<a href=\"#bib22\">Suzuki et al., 2014</a>) and the position of the Ndc80 C-terminus based on electron microscopy of the purified complex (<a href=\"#bib27\">Wei et al., 2005</a>). However, the CENP-A-to-Spc24 measurement in Suzuki <i>et al.</i> was effectively one-dimensional (\u0394<sub>1D</sub>, see supplemental discussion); applying the same 1D method to our data gives a distance of 57.9 (\u00b1 1.1) nm (n = 1002; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) indicating that projection effects (3D to 1D) may be giving a misleading picture of kinetochore structure/architecture."

We found no correlation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) indicating that the CENP-A-to-Ndc80(C) connection is indeed non-compliant (stiff). To test this under more extreme changes of applied load, we tested how loss of microtubule attachment would affect \u0394<sub>3D</sub> by treating cells with 3 \u00b5M nocodazole for 2\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This small change in \u0394<sub>3D</sub> for the CENP-A-to-Ndc80(C) linkage is consistent with the only other live measurement of \u0394 in human cells (between CENP-A and mCherry-Mis12) where \u0394<sub>2D</sub> decreased marginally under nocodazole (<a href=\"#bib24\">Uchida et al., 2009</a>).

We detected a ~15 nm reduction in \u0394<sub>3D</sub> following nocodazole treatment, with up to half of this contributed from the change in the inner domain discussed above (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The additional movement of the Ndc80\u2009N-terminus may relate to the conformational change in the NDC80 complex that has been reported in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aravamudhan et al., 2015</a>) although further experiments will be needed to confirm this. This delta change is smaller than that seen in fixed cells (see <a href=\"#bib9\">Etemad et al., 2015</a>, and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>) a difference that may reflect the reported effects of fixation on kinetochore integrity/epitope accessibility (<a href=\"#bib13\">Magidson et al., 2016</a>). We conclude that microtubule-pulling forces do not dramatically stretch the kinetochore and that the intra-kinetochore linkages are relatively stiff. This is consistent with previous work showing that the outer domain is non-compliant (<a href=\"#bib22\">Suzuki et al., 2014</a>)."

For example, the CENP-A-to-Ndc80(C) measurement for \u0394<sub>1D</sub> decreased by 70% from 57.9 (\u00b1 1.1) nm in untreated cells to 17.8 (\u00b1 4.4) nm in nocodazole treated cells. This 40 nm change observed in 1D is considerably more than the 5 nm (5%) changes in \u0394<sub>3D</sub>. The observed discrepancy between \u0394<sub>1D</sub> and \u0394<sub>3D</sub> suggests that a rotation is present and that this is the major degree of freedom upon microtubule attachment (rather than the stretching of the kinetochore). This rotation of the outer kinetochore around the inner kinetochore is apparent in images of the eGFP-CENP-A and Ndc80-tagRFP signals, which are rarely perfectly co-linear (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This is not due to the kinetochore markers used because the same effect is seen when observing other inner/outer kinetochore markers (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, \u0394<sub>1D</sub> underestimates the distance between the inner and outer kinetochore because the outer kinetochore exhibits substantial rotation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

Swivel was calculated as the angle tended by the vector between the paired sisters\u2019 eGFP signals (sister-sister axis) and the vector between the eGFP and tagRFP signals on each kinetochore (the kinetochore axis, defined by the inner/outer domain marker axis) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This degree of freedom is distinct from the twist angle of a kinetochore pair, <i>i.e.</i> the angle tended between the sister-sister axis and the normal to the metaphase plate. Calculation of swivel across all untreated kinetochores yielded a median of 51.6\u00b0 as compared to 73.8\u00b0 in 3 \u00b5M nocodazole (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) \u2013 this difference is significant (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a010<sup>\u20134</sup>) and explains the decrease in the 1D measurement of \u0394 in nocodazole-treated cells. To remove effects due to the lower resolution in the <i>z</i>-axis, swivel was decomposed into components; we defined the <i>y</i>-directional swivel as the projection onto the <i>xy</i>-plane. This measurement showed that 3 \u00b5M nocodazole treatment results in a larger range of <i>y</i>-directional swivel (population standard deviation = 56.4\u00b0 in untreated vs. 89.5\u00b0 in 3 \u00b5M nocodazole), with some outer kinetochores capable of rotating inside the eGFP signal (i.e. <i>y</i>-swivel &gt; 90\u00b0; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), which explains the presence of negative measurements for \u0394<sub>1D</sub>. We confirmed the increase in swivel between GFP-CENP-C and Ndc80(C) in live cells and between CENP-A and the MIS12 complex in paraformaldehyde-fixed cells treated with nocodazole (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). This increase in 3D swivel and broadening of <i>y</i>-directional swivel using CENP-A-to-Ndc80(C) were also seen in 10 \u00b5M taxol-treated cells, albeit to a lesser extent (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This condition leaves the spindle intact and suggests that loss of microtubule pulling force is sufficient to increase swivel, although loss of microtubule-kinetochore attachment increases swivel still further. Furthermore, <i>y</i>-swivel changes over time demonstrating that kinetochores do not have a fixed swivel, swivel potentially adapting to changes in microtubule attachment, microtubule forces and sister kinetochore dynamics (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

We found that kinetochore pairs at the centre of the metaphase plate exhibited a smaller degree of swivel compared to those at the periphery (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). Plotting <i>y</i>-directional swivel against the position along the metaphase plate in the <i>y</i>-axis demonstrated that kinetochores begin to exhibit swivel towards their attached spindle pole (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), a phenomenon that is more evident once kinetochore pairs are beyond 4 \u00b5m from the centre of the metaphase plate. To confirm this we performed immunofluorescence to visualise the k-fibres using anti-tubulin antibodies under paraformaldehyde fixation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The eGFP, tagRFP and k-fibre signals were approximately co-linear, with the angles tended on the inter-sister axis by the k-fibre (<math id=\"inf20\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi>\u03d1</mi></mrow></mstyle></math><sub>kMT</sub>) and intra-kinetochore axes (<math id=\"inf21\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi>\u03d1</mi></mrow></mstyle></math><sub><i>y</i>-swivel</sub>) being significantly correlated (r = 0.371, p\u00a0&lt;\u00a010<sup>\u20134</sup>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Our live cell data questions this model and thus prompted us to investigate whether outer domain swivel was correlated with anaphase onset. To do this we took advantage of the observation that the thickness of the metaphase plate reduces as a cell transits metaphase and approaches anaphase onset (<a href=\"#bib10\">Jaqaman et al., 2010</a>). We plotted the <i>y</i>-directional swivel against the position of a kinetochore in the <i>y</i>-direction and the thickness of the metaphase plate. Fitting a sheet to this data reveals how swivel clearly decreases as a cell moves through metaphase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Our previous observation that swivel increases towards the periphery of the plate holds true across the range of plate thicknesses, although the range over which swivel increased at the plate periphery decreased with decreasing plate thickness (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Binning the plate thicknesses allowed a statistical comparison that peripheral kinetochores decreased absolute <i>y</i>-swivel from 45.7 (\u00b1 1.9) \u00b0 (n = 455) in early metaphase to 33.6 (\u00b1 1.4) \u00b0 (n = 460) in late metaphase (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a010<sup>\u20134</sup>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a>, and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>).

On the other hand, \u0394<sub>3D</sub> (CENP-A-to-Ndc80(C))\u00a0does not increase as metaphase progresses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), further highlighting how swivel is the distinctive mechanical change in kinetochore structure that correlates with time of anaphase onset."

How swivel relates to aurora kinase activity during early mitosis when error correction is active will be an important area for future study. It is also tempting to speculate that kinetochores are undergoing a shift in their mechanochemical status in readiness for the imminent onset of anaphase. As well as the swivel changes reported here, this may also directly relate to the observation that kinetochore speeds decrease as anaphase approaches (<a href=\"#bib10\">Jaqaman et al., 2010</a>)."

We cannot rule out that we are observing a complete rotation of the whole kinetochore structure within the chromosome (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G(ii)</a>). This idea is supported by the positive correlation in the tilt of elliptical CENP-A and Ndc80 fluorescence signals in fixed cell imaging (<a href=\"#bib25\">Wan et al., 2009</a>). The fact that swivelling is most extreme on unattached kinetochores suggests that it may optimise the microtubule search-and-capture process (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G(i)</a>) \u2013 this would have a similar effect to broadening of the microtubule-binding region of the kinetochore, as has been implicated in the timing and accuracy of search-and-capture (<a href=\"#bib29\">Zaytsev et al., 2015</a>)."

However, changes in delta under different physiological conditions need to be interpreted with caution as the shape and size of kinetochore domains are subject to change (see <a href=\"#bib13\">Magidson et al., 2016</a>). Moreover, the NDC80 complex can be recruited via two distinct physical linkages (CENP-T and CENP-C/Mis12) which may have different compliances/conformational dynamics and further complicate interpretation of delta measurements. Nevertheless, delta and swivel do provide information on the supramolecular organisation of the kinetochore and as such should provide important insights into the mechanical and organisational changes that are taking place during the cycles of microtubule attachment and potential regulatory processes of error-correction and SAC activation/silencing."

Camera pixels had an effective pixel size of 69.4 nm in the axial direction, as measured using a microscopic ruler (Pyser SGI,\u00a0UK). The two cameras were preliminarily aligned using Volocity by aligning 500 nm TetraSpeck fluorescence microspheres (Thermofisher) in the 488 and 561 nm wavelengths. For live cell imaging, a common light path containing two wavelengths was split by a dichroic to each of the two cameras to allow simultaneous imaging of two wavelengths. Cells were first identified using bright-field illumination to minimise phototoxicity. Interphase cells imaged for chromatic shift calculation were imaged over 121 <i>z</i>-slices separated by 100 nm for a single image stack. Laser power in the 488 and 561 nm wavelengths were both set to 15% with exposure time 50 ms per <i>z</i>-slice. Metaphase cells expressing eGFP-CENP-A and Ndc80-tagRFP were imaged over time for dual colour tracking (dynamic live movies), whilst all other metaphase cells were imaged at a single time point for dual colour spot finding (static live images), all utilising the two camera setup. For dynamic live movies, cells were imaged over 61 <i>z</i>-slices separated by 200 nm, for 5\u2009min every 7.5\u2009s (41 time points). Laser power in the 488 nm wavelength was set to 5%. Laser power in the 561 nm wavelength was set to 20% over z-slices 26\u201341 (from the bottom of the cell), and set to 0% for all other <i>z</i>-slices to minimise phototoxicity.

Images were deconvolved in the 640 nm wavelength within Huygens 4.1 using a theoretical PSF. Deconvolved images were exported from Huygens 4.1 in. r3d format (Applied Precision, Slovakia), and read into MATLAB (R2012a; Mathworks, Natick, MA) using the loci-tools java library (The Open Microscopy Environment). Chromatic shift was calculated as described below. For dynamic live movies, sister kinetochores were detected using the eGFP signal, aligned, tracked and paired in MATLAB as previously described (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burroughs et al., 2015</a>). tagRFP fluorescence signal was detected within a hemispherical mask with 300 nm radius directed normal to the metaphase plate and away from the sister pair centre; the hemisphere was centred at the eGFP coordinate, corrected for chromatic shift from the 488 to 561 nm wavelength. 3D Gaussians were then fit to tagRFP spots to find sub-pixel spot centre coordinates (in the same way as is done for eGFP signal), and corrected for chromatic shift into the eGFP wavelength frame of reference. For static live images, the centres of green fluorescence spots were located by 3D Gaussian mixture model fitting (MMF), and red fluorescence signal located, also by Gaussian MMF, within a 300 nm-radius sphere centred at the eGFP spot. Red spot coordinates were then corrected for chromatic shift.

Chromatic shift correction of untreated and taxol-treated live dynamic movies of cells expressing eGFP-CENP-A and Ndc80-tagRFP were calculated using cells expressing both eGFP-CENP-A and mCherry-CENP-A, whilst chromatic shift correction of nocodazole-treated live dynamic movies, all static live and all immunofluorescence images were calculated using cells expressing HaloTag-CENP-A. HaloTag-CENP-A cells were prepared by simultaneously incubating with 2.5 \u00b5M Oregon Green (Promega) and 1 \u00b5M TMR (Promega) fluorescent ligands for 15\u2009min, followed by 30\u2009min incubation in ligand-free growth medium before imaging. Green and red fluorescence was imaged simultaneously on two separate CCD cameras with a voxel size of 69.4 \u00d7 69.4 \u00d7 100 nm. The centres of green spots were located by 3D Gaussian MMF, and red signal located, also by Gaussian MMF, within a 300 nm-radius sphere centred at the green spot. Chromatic shift from green to red signal, \u03b6 = [\u03b6<sub>x</sub>, \u03b6<sub>y</sub>, \u03b6<sub>z</sub>], also incorporating mis-alignment of the two cameras, was calculated as the 3D vector pointing from the green to the red spot centres in the microscope coordinate system. Quality of spots was optimised by accepting only green spots with intensity &gt;\u00a025% that of the maximum spot intensity, and those not located within 750 nm of another green spot. Due to a linear dependence in the dual camera setup of \u03b6<sub>z</sub> on the focal distance away from the glass slide, \u03b6<sub>z</sub> was shifted by +78.2 nm to adjust for the increased distance of the 3 \u00b5m thick region of the metaphase plate imaged in the eGFP/tagRFP channels from interphase to mitotic cells (this shift was not required when using a\u00a0single camera for\u00a0imaging, i.e. for\u00a0the immunofluorescence experiments). The standard deviation of \u03b6 distributions, averaged over all live dynamic experiments, were 25.5, 23.1 and 43.0 nm for \u03b6<sub>x</sub>, \u03b6<sub>y</sub> and \u03b6<sub>z</sub> respectively. To validate our calculated chromatic shift we analysed the distribution of \u0394 in the <i>x, y</i> and <i>z</i> direction for the live dynamic untreated movies (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). \u0394<sub>x</sub> should be bimodal and symmetrical about zero, because the Ndc80 and CENP-A signals are on average orientated along the normal to the metaphase plate pointing at one of the two spindle poles. The \u0394<sub>x</sub> distribution was bimodal with median value 5.4 (\u00b1 1.2) nm (n = 4291;\u00a0<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). We expect \u0394<sub>y</sub> and \u0394<sub>z</sub> to be centred around zero because on average Ndc80 and CENP-A should not be displaced relative to each other in the <i>y</i> or <i>z</i> direction. This is the case with the median \u0394<sub>y</sub> and \u0394<sub>z</sub> values being 8.8 (\u00b1 1.0) nm and \u20132.9 (\u00b1 0.9) nm respectively (each n = 4291; <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). Thus, our shift correction from interphase cells when applied to metaphase cells recreates the known average geometry for the kinetochore inner and outer plates."

Most prior \u03b4 measurements have not systematically taken into account the displacement of kinetochores in the z-axis. This work addresses a gap in the field by tracking metaphase kinetochore pairs in 3D in live cells and measuring \u03b4 in unperturbed cells and cells treated with microtubule drugs that activate the SAC. In contrast with previous work, this study finds that there is no significant change in 3D distance between the inner and outer kinetochore. This calls into question the role of changes in \u03b4 as a signal for SAC satisfaction. The authors suggest that the intrakinetochore distance changes others report in 2D and 1D measurements actually occur because of a displacement of the outer kinetochore relative to the inner kinetochore, a feature they term \"swivel\". They find that kinetochore swivel increases in response to treatment with nocodazole and decreases as kinetochore-microtubule attachments form and mature. These findings identify a previously undescribed feature of kinetochore structure and challenge the existing model that intrakinetochore distance changes control the SAC. Swivel reflects the intrinsic mechanical flexibility of kinetochore structure, which may allow the kinetochore to stably maintain attachment to stiff microtubules."

The characterization of swivel as a new degree of freedom in kinetochore architecture is convincing and brings new insight into the dynamics of kinetochore structure (or lack thereof) during mitotic spindle assembly. The suggestion that swivel has been so far mistaken for actual changes in intra-kinetochore stretch, causing the distance between the inner and outer plates to be sometimes underestimated when measured in 1D, is also compelling."

This is an interesting and important conclusion, and the approach used here sets a standard for the field. The conclusions of the study are limited to the particular distance measurements chosen by the authors. Ultimately, the authors should attempt to address the discrepancy between this paper's results and the results of Etemad et al. Nat Comm 2015. Etemad et al. used CENP-C and the N-terminal region of Hec1 to calculate 3D intrakinetochore distances in fixed cells and found that the distance changes significantly in nocodazole. This suggests that the present manuscript's findings may reflect a different probe choice (e.g. CENP-A vs. CENP-C or N- or C-termini of Ndc80/Hec1). Alternatively, the difference might arise because Etemad et al. fixed cells where the authors use live cells. In either case, it would be important to identify the source of the discrepancy."

This is an interesting and important conclusion, and the approach used here sets a standard for the field. The conclusions of the study are limited to the particular distance measurements chosen by the authors. Ultimately, the authors should attempt to address the discrepancy between this paper's results and the results of Etemad et al. Nat Comm 2015. Etemad et al. used CENP-C and the N-terminal region of Hec1 to calculate 3D intrakinetochore distances in fixed cells and found that the distance changes significantly in nocodazole. This suggests that the present manuscript's findings may reflect a different probe choice (e.g. CENP-A vs. CENP-C or N- or C-termini of Ndc80/Hec1). Alternatively, the difference might arise because Etemad et al. fixed cells where the authors use live cells. In either case, it would be important to identify the source of the discrepancy.</i> "

We found smaller changes of 3D \u03b4 under nocodazole treatment compared to Etemad (17 nm vs. 25 nm). This may reflect fixation effects (see Magidson et al., JCB, 2016) and/or that Etemad et al. used the centre of mass to identify spot positions based on 147 measurements. In our experiment we used a more accurate Gaussian mixture model (&gt;8000 measurements) and also did not arrest cells in MG132. We also note that in live cells the distance from GFP-CENP-C to mCherry-Ndc80 reduces by only 10 nm in nocodazole and therefore fixation may inflate this particular measurement."
