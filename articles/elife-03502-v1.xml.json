Here, we report that Trithorax (Trx) actively maintains the heterogeneity of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) in the developing <i>Drosophila</i> larval brain. <i>trx</i> mutant type II neuroblasts gradually adopt a type I neuroblast functional identity, losing the competence to generate intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) and directly generating differentiated cells. Trx regulates a type II neuroblast functional identity in part by maintaining chromatin in the <i>buttonhead</i> (<i>btd</i>) locus in an active state through the histone methyltransferase activity of the SET1/MLL complex. Consistently, <i>btd</i> is necessary and sufficient for eliciting a type II neuroblast functional identity. Furthermore, over-expression of <i>btd</i> restores the competence to generate INPs in <i>trx</i> mutant type II neuroblasts. Thus, Trx instructs a type II neuroblast functional identity by epigenetically promoting Btd expression, thereby maintaining neuroblast functional heterogeneity."
