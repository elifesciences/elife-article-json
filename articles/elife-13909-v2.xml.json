TAp63\u03b1 is kept in an inactive and exclusively dimeric state but undergoes rapid phosphorylation-induced tetramerization and concomitant activation upon detection of DNA damage. Here we show that the TAp63\u03b1 dimer is a kinetically trapped state. Activation follows a spring-loaded mechanism not requiring further translation of other cellular factors in oocytes and is associated with unfolding of the inhibitory structure that blocks the tetramerization interface. Using a combination of biophysical methods as well as cell and ovary culture experiments we explain how TAp63\u03b1 is kept inactive in the absence of DNA damage but causes rapid oocyte elimination in response to a few DNA double strand breaks thereby acting as the key quality control factor in maternal reproduction."

TAp63\u03b1 is kept in an inactive and exclusively dimeric state but undergoes rapid phosphorylation-induced tetramerization and concomitant activation upon detection of DNA damage. Here we show that the TAp63\u03b1 dimer is a kinetically trapped state. Activation follows a spring-loaded mechanism not requiring further translation of other cellular factors in oocytes and is associated with unfolding of the inhibitory structure that blocks the tetramerization interface. Using a combination of biophysical methods as well as cell and ovary culture experiments we explain how TAp63\u03b1 is kept inactive in the absence of DNA damage but causes rapid oocyte elimination in response to a few DNA double strand breaks thereby acting as the key quality control factor in maternal reproduction."

Probably the most ancient function of this family is the maintenance of genetic quality in germ cells since even short lived eukaryotic animals express a p63-like protein in their germ cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ollmann et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Derry et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brodsky et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Suh et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ou et al., 2007</a>). In mammals, up to 10 diverse p63 isoforms exist with the longest one, TAp63\u03b1, being highly expressed in primary oocytes that are arrested in prophase of meiosis I. After homologous recombination, oocytes are kept in this dictyate arrest phase until they are recruited for ovulation, a period that can take decades in humans. Once oocytes reenter the cell cycle, expression of TAp63\u03b1 is lost (<a href=\"#bib43\">Suh et al., 2006</a>). Since p63 can initiate apoptosis the high expression level of TAp63\u03b1 in oocytes requires that its activity is tightly regulated. Recently we could show that TAp63\u03b1 assembles into a closed and only dimeric conformation in which the protein is inactive (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deutsch et al., 2011</a>). Detection of DNA damage leads to activation of p63 triggered by phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Suh et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bolcun-Filas et al., 2014</a>) that results in the formation of open tetramers with a twentyfold higher DNA binding affinity and the induction of apoptosis."

Irradiation with 0.45 Gy is sufficient to eliminate all p63-expressing oocytes in mice while all surrounding cells of the ovaries survive. To understand the mechanism of inhibition and activation we have started to characterize the structural requirements for the formation of the closed and dimeric state of TAp63\u03b1. In previous experiments we have shown that the very C-terminus contains a transactivation inhibitory domain (TID) that is of central importance for creating the closed dimeric state (<a href=\"#bib40\">Serber et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Straub et al., 2010</a>). We have suggested a model in which both the C-terminal TID and the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) interact with the central tetramerization domain (TD) thereby preventing the formation of tetramers. This central TD is a dimer of dimers suggesting that blocking the interface by which two dimers form a tetramer is the most likely mechanism of inhibition. In the past we have identified mutations in all three domains \u2013 TAD, TD and TID \u2013 that break the inhibitory mechanism, establishing that at least these three domains are involved in this process. In the absence of a high resolution structure we have now used systematic alanine scanning and charge swap mutagenesis in combination with SAXS (small angle X-ray scattering) experiments to build a model of the closed and dimeric complex. In addition, we show that the inhibited conformation is a kinetically trapped state and that the oocyte contains all factors necessary to activate p63 without requirement of further protein expression. Together our data show that activation of TAp63\u03b1 follows a spring-loaded mechanism and explains why oocytes are far more sensitive to DNA damage than the surrounding follicular cells."

                                "text": "TAp63\u03b1 contains three folded domains, the DNA binding domain (DBD), the tetramerization domain (TD) and the SAM domain that are linked by unstructured regions. NMR experiments with a tetrameric construct containing all three folded domains showed that these domains behave independently as pearls on a string (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). All sequences outside of these folded domains are not structured in isolation but may be folded when interacting with other segments of the protein as part of the inhibitory mechanism. To identify the exact sequence elements required to form the closed state, we systematically deleted sequences in these linker regions. Deletion of sequences crucial for the formation of the closed state results in the formation of an open conformation. Previously we have shown that the open state can be detected by a conformation sensitive pull-down experiment: tetrameric mutants with an intact TAD can be pulled down with a GST-TID construct (569\u2013616) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Straub et al., 2010</a>). Thus, mutants that cannot be pulled down are assumed to adopt the closed dimeric state. After several rounds of deletion mutagenesis, a minimal dimeric construct was obtained. Size exclusion chromatography combined with multi angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) confirmed that this minimal construct (TAp63\u03b1<sub>min</sub>) comprising deletions \u0394(1\u20139; 64\u2013119; 417\u2013453; 460\u2013505; 571\u2013593; 615\u2013641) is a stable dimer in solution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In addition, deletion of amino acids 322\u2013342 between DBD and TD does not disrupt the dimeric state (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), but results in quite low expression levels in E. coli. For the experiments described below we have, therefore, used either TAp63\u03b1<sub>min</sub>, wild type TAp63\u03b1 or a slightly shortened version TAp63\u03b1<sub>(10\u2013614)</sub> lacking unstructured sequences in the N- and C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

To investigate whether these domains participate in the stabilization of the closed conformation we deleted each domain separately in TAp63\u03b1<sub>(10\u2013614)</sub> and performed pull-down experiments with GST-TID. Interestingly, deletion of the SAM domain did not show any significant pull-down and size exclusion chromatography confirmed the formation of closed dimers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>). On the contrary, deletion of the DBD resulted in a strong pull-down signal suggesting an open state (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Initially we expected the DBD to participate in essential domain-domain contacts that stabilize the closed conformation and therefore conducted an extensive mutagenesis screen of surface residues of the DBD (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). However, none of the mutants formed tetramers making this hypothesis unlikely. Alternatively, the DBD may be important for geometric reasons, acting as a spacer between TAD and TD. To test this hypothesis, we replaced the DBD by superfolder GFP (sfGFP) which is very stable and of similar size as the DBD. SEC analysis of this chimeric protein expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) suggested that it adopts a closed dimeric conformation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Moreover, mutations F16A W20A L23A within the TAD and F605A T606A L608A within the TID resulted in the formation of a tetrameric state similar to experiments with wild type TAp63\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Straub et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C and E</a>). Similarly, replacement of the DBD by MBP enables the formation of a closed dimeric state (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4F</a>). These results suggest that the DBD does not participate in essential domain-domain interactions necessary to form the dimeric state and that the closed dimeric state of TAp63\u03b1 is formed by interaction of the N-terminal TAD, the central TD and the C-terminal TID. Nonetheless, constructs that only contain these three domains did not form dimers but aggregated, suggesting that the DBD or a domain of similar size is necessary for structural reasons or for the folding process."

In the closed dimer, two TID and two TA2B sequences must be involved in the stabilization of the closed state. For symmetry reasons, the \u03b2-strands probably adopt an antiparallel orientation. Based on the results of the alanine scanning experiments we speculated that the two TID strands form the inner pair since mutations on both faces of the predicted \u03b2-sheet show strong effects. Further, we propose that the two TA2B strands form the two outer strands of a four stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet which might be further extended by \u03b2-strands contributed by the TA2A segment. Such an arrangement would create one hydrophobic surface formed by I50/I52/M54 of TA2B and V603/F605/L607 of TID and a hydrophilic surface with residues E51/D55 of TA2B and R604/R608 of TID. The arrangement shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> brings charged amino acids on neighboring strands in close proximity, making it possible to test this hypothetical model by charge change and charge swap mutagenesis. Exchanging R604 and R608 in the TID to glutamic acids disrupted the dimeric state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In our model these mutants created in combination with the negative charges on the TA2B strands a cluster of negatively charged amino acids that destabilized the dimer. Additional charge reversal of E51R and D55R in TA2B resulted in the formation of a stable dimer. Similarly, the R595E and R598E mutants are open tetramers and the additional charge reversal of D61R, D63R in TA2B rescued the dimer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). To refine our model and to identify the register of the proposed \u03b2-strands we used further pairwise charge swap mutations. The results of these experiments that all support our structural model are summarized in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Since the predicted \u03b2-sheet has one hydrophobic face and the interface used by the TD to form tetramers is also hydrophobic, we propose that the \u03b2-sheet covers the tetramerization interface of the TD, thus inhibiting the formation of tetramers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>). In addition, the TA1 helix binds to the TD as well, further stabilizing the closed and compact conformation."

                                "text": "Activation of TAp63\u03b1 entails breaking of the interactions described above to expose the tetramerization interface leading to the formation of active tetramers. In oocytes this transition is triggered by phosphorylation. In principle phosphorylation could provide a new interface contributing interactions that stabilize the tetrameric state, making it thermodynamically more stable while the dimeric state would be thermodynamically favored in the absence of phosphorylation. However, the observation that dephosphorylation of the open tetrameric state using \u03bb-phosphatase does not result in converting TAp63\u03b1 back to a dimer argues against this model (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deutsch et al., 2011</a>). An alternative explanation would be that the tetrameric state is always the thermodynamically most stable one and the dimeric state is a kinetically trapped conformation. Phosphorylation would then function as a trigger to overcome a kinetic barrier and convert p63 into the thermodynamically preferred tetramer. Such spring-loaded mechanisms have been observed for example in the activation of influenza hemagglutinin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carr et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Carr and Kim, 1993</a>). Characteristic for this type of activation mechanism is that perturbing the kinetically trapped conformation by moderate amounts of denaturants, changes in pH or an increase in temperature initiates the transition to the thermodynamically more stable conformation even without the natural trigger. Since the stability towards chemical denaturants of the three folded domains of TAp63\u03b1 is quite high (<a href=\"#bib23\">Klein et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sathyamurthy et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)\u00a0we hypothesized that using low to moderate amounts of urea might disrupt the inhibitory structure, thus triggering the formation of the tetramer without affecting the folding of the DBD, the SAM or the TD. To investigate if activation of TAp63\u03b1 follows a spring-loaded mechanism we equilibrated a SEC column with different concentrations of urea, incubated TAp63\u03b1<sub>min</sub> in buffer containing the same urea concentration and analyzed the percentage of dimer and tetramer. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> shows that a concentration of 1.75\u2009M urea leads to an approximately 1:1 ratio of dimer and tetramer and at concentrations above 3\u2009M no dimer was detected. Higher urea concentrations resulted in further shifts on the SEC column probably representing partially denatured conformations (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).\u00a0To validate the data we performed SEC-MALS measurements at concentrations of 2\u2009M and 2.5\u2009M urea (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F and G</a>). The first SEC peak had a mass of 197.9 \u00b1 12.7\u2009kDa (at 2.5\u2009M urea) and the second peak a mass of 96.3 \u00b1 6.4\u2009kDa (at 2\u2009M urea), consistent with the first one representing a tetrameric (202.8\u2009kDa) and the second one a dimeric (101.4\u2009kDa) conformation."

From p53 it is known that this protein forms dimers co-translationally (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nicholls et al., 2002</a>), which in the case of TAp63\u03b1 would enable the protein to fold into its closed conformation. To probe this hypothesis, we expressed TAp63\u03b1 in RRL in the presence or absence of a high concentration (20 \u00b5M) of the isolated TD of p73. The rationale behind this experiment was that a high concentration of a domain that can interact with the TD of TAp63\u03b1 during the translation would result in the formation of open tetramers. The TD of p73 was used since the isolated p63 and p73 TDs form hetero-tetramers that are thermodynamically even more stable than homo-tetramers (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coutandin et al., 2009</a>). As a control we stopped the translation of TAp63\u03b1 in RRL by adding cycloheximide (CHX) and then added the p73 TD to the same concentration as before and incubated for the same amount of time. Interaction between TAp63\u03b1 and the p73 TD was monitored by pull-down experiments via the His-tag of the p73 TD. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>, expression in the presence of the p73 TD resulted in a strong pull-down while incubation post-translationally showed virtually no interaction with the p73 TD, even at elevated temperatures of 37<sup>o</sup>C. Replacing TAp63\u03b1 in these experiments with open and tetrameric \u0394Np63\u03b1 or a tetrameric mutant TAp63\u03b1 R604E R608E resulted in strong pull-downs both in the co-translational as well as in the post-translational setup. Performing the same experiments with a mutated TD that is not capable of forming hetero-tetramers showed no interaction. These results suggested that the kinetically trapped state of TAp63\u03b1 is formed during or immediately after protein synthesis."

However, thermodynamics predicts that the closed conformation is always in equilibrium with more open conformations in which the inhibitory network of the TAD, TD and TID is at least partially broken. If during this partial unfolding no thermodynamically more stable tetramer is formed the dimer might be able to refold in its closed conformation. To obtain an estimation of the rate of unfolding of the TID and of the TAD we introduced TEV protease cleavage sites either C-terminal to the TAD or N-terminal to the TID. The rationale of this experiment was that after proteolytic cleavage the cleaved peptides (either the TAD or the TID) would diffuse away as soon as the p63 adopts an open conformation, therefore not allowing the protein to refold into its compact dimeric state and forcing it to form open tetramers. From this experiment the off rate of the corresponding domain can be estimated and thus the overall stability of the inhibitory lock mechanism. We incubated RRL expressed TAp63\u03b1 with TEV protease for 15 min at 37\u00b0C which was sufficient to obtain close to 100% cleavage (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The cleaved protein was then analyzed either immediately via SEC or further incubated for up to 12\u2009hr at 37<sup>o</sup>C. Interestingly, cleavage near the TAD leads to the immediate formation of tetramers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Unlike the TAD, the TID was bound with remarkable stability and cleaved p63 showed no tendency to assemble into tetramers even after long incubation times (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). These results demonstrated that the N-terminus is the least stable part involved in keeping TAp63\u03b1 dimeric and that its off rate determines the overall stability of the inhibited conformation. In addition, this interpretation further supports our model assuming that the TID forms the core of the central \u03b2-sheet."

Such a mechanism allows the cell to build an apoptotic switch with a sharp transition between survival and cell death. Indeed, measurements of the dose dependence of oocyte death have shown such a sharp transition with fewer than 10 double strand breaks per cell leading to oocyte death. To make such a system efficient the cell would need to be able to activate TAp63\u03b1 fast which is best achieved when the activation machinery, i.e. the kinases required are already present and do not have to be expressed first. To investigate if oocytes have established such a pre-existing machinery, we harvested ovaries from eight day old mice and \u03b3-irradiated them with or without prior incubation with cycloheximide. Activation of TAp63\u03b1 was followed by native geleletrophoresis. Addition of cycloheximide did neither prevent phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) nor the formation of a tetrameric state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013D</a>), suggesting that the kinases involved in detecting DNA damage and activating TAp63\u03b1 are already present in resting oocytes. As a control to verify the effectiveness of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide we investigated the level of polyubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Adding a proteasome inhibitor results in a strong accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins that is suppressed by the addition of cycloheximide, as previously shown (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mimnaugh et al., 2004</a>)."

To test whether the treatment with cycloheximide affects the transcriptional activity of TAp63\u03b1 we used qPCR to detect mRNA levels of the three p63 targets p21, Puma and Mdm2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). As a control we used the oocyte specific marker Msy2. The data showed that both with and without cycloheximide treatment significant induction of the target genes occurred while the level of Msy2 was unaffected. We could not detect the presence of p53 before or eight hours after irradiation by immunohistochemistry, suggesting that p53 is not involved in the apoptosis of oocytes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This interpretation is also consistent with the observation that oocytes only from the TAp63 but not the p53 knock out mouse are protected from irradiation induced apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Suh et al., 2006</a>). For p73 we could detect a weak, diffuse staining consistent with earlier reports of low levels of cytoplasmic p73 in oocytes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Livera et al., 2008</a>). The very low level compared to p63 and the strong induction of target genes such as PUMA or p21 in the presence of the translational inhibitor cycloheximide, however, argue against a significant role of p73 for the irradiation induced cell death of oocytes."

One of the kinases that has been identified in the activation process is Chk2 that phosphorylates TAp63\u03b1 on Ser 582 (numbering according to the TA-isoform of p63) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bolcun-Filas et al., 2014</a>). To investigate if phosphorylation by Chk2 is required for tetramerization we treated mouse ovaries with increasing amounts of the Chk2 inhibitor II BML-277 and irradiated them with a dose of 1.5 Gy two hours after adding the inhibitor. At a concentration of 25 \u00b5M phosphorylation of TAp63\u03b1 was almost completely suppressed and almost no tetramer was formed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). These data confirm the essential role of Chk2 in the activation process and demonstrate that phosphorylation by Chk2 is also a prerequisite for the formation of tetramers. Interestingly, these data also show that activation of TAp63\u03b1 leads to a very significant drop of the intracellular concentration and inhibition of the activation by the Chk2 inhibitor to a preservation of the original level. This effect is due to fast proteasomal degradation of activated TAp63\u03b1 and is consistent with other observations showing that the cellular concentration of active isoforms of p63 is low while inactive isoforms can accumulate to high concentrations (<a href=\"#bib40\">Serber et al., 2002</a>). Interestingly, it has been shown that the N-terminal TAD is involved in this degradation process and that degradation is linked to DNA-binding competent and transactivating p63 isoforms (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ying et al., 2005</a>). This observation is also consistent with our model in which the TAD is involved in the formation of the inhibitory lock structure that covers the tetramerizatoin interface and is therefore protected from ubiquitination. After the formation of the open and active state, however, the TAD is accessible, leading to fast degradation. This competition between activation and degradation probably constitutes an intracellular threshold that protect oocytes from apoptosis by low levels of activated TAp63\u03b1."

In humans the approximately seven million oocytes that are created during embryogenesis are diminished to one to two million at the time of birth (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tilly, 2001</a>). A large drop in numbers is also seen for mouse oocytes. Of the original roughly 25,000 cells only 10,000 remain at the time of birth (<a href=\"#bib13\">Di Giacomo et al., 2005</a>). During the late embryonic stage, the sensitivity of oocytes to DNA double strand breaks changes dramatically. While oocytes in the leptotene stage of prophase I (around E14) tolerate hundreds of Spo11 induced double strand breaks as part of the process of homologous recombination, postnatal oocytes are killed by fewer than 10 DNA double strand breaks per cell. This dramatic shift in sensitivity is correlated with the expression of TAp63\u03b1 which starts to get expressed in the diplotene stage beginning around E18.5 when chromosomes have been repaired after homologous recombination (<a href=\"#bib28\">Livera et al., 2008</a>). Most likely, the p63 system developed as a safeguard to ensure that cells that still contain chromosome damage do not survive. The finding that the p63 expression level is kept high during the long dictyate arrest in mammals, however, shows that p63 is not only used as a short term quality control check point but also as a factor that guarantees the long term genetic stability of germ cells. In particular, this long term quality control function requires a tightly controlled activity of p63. A basal activity that is too high would lead to premature loss of the oocyte pool and ovary failure while a low activity bears the risk that oocytes acquire a high level of chromosomal defects. Our extensive mutagenesis study and biophysical characterization now provides a first model how interaction of N-terminal and C-terminal sequences blocks the tetramerization interface of the TD and therefore prevents tetramerization."

Our results show that the closed conformation of TAp63\u03b1 is a metastable state and that activation follows a spring-loaded mechanism (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In oocytes, phosphorylation is used as the natural trigger to initiate the transition from the closed dimeric state to the thermodynamically more stable tetrameric state. Once the active tetramer is formed, the phosphate groups can be removed without affecting the oligomeric state of the protein (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deutsch et al., 2011</a>). Spring loaded activation mechanisms are known from other proteins as well. One prominent example is the Influenza virus hemagglutinin A (HA). This membrane protein is trapped in a metastable native pre-fusion state in which the fusion peptide is buried inside the trimeric structure (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carr and Kim, 1993</a>). Following endocytosis of the virus and a pH drop in the endosome, the protein changes its conformation resulting in the exposure of the fusion peptides that are subsequently inserted into the host membrane (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lin et al., 2014</a>). While the drop in pH is the natural trigger, activation can also be initiated by high temperatures or urea (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carr et al., 1997</a>). Another example is \u03b1-lytic protease, a secreted serine protease that is expressed with an N-terminal pro-region that catalyzes folding from a stable molten globule-like intermediate. Proteolytic degradation of the pro-region results in release of the native and active protease, which is thermodynamically less stable than the partially unfolded state but remains folded due to a large barrier to unfolding (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sohl et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Baker, 1998</a>)."

As a model we propose that open dimers form co-translationally via the TD that acts as the interaction platform for the TAD and the TID to fold into the trapped conformation after completion of translation. The exact mechanism of folding and a potential role for chaperones remains to be investigated."

The SAXS detector was triggered by the 280 nm UV sensor in the Agilent HPLC, and allowed the collection of data in 1\u2009s time bins across the peak of interest. A Shodex KW404 column was utilised for these experiments. At the end of each experimental run, SAXS data were integrated using beamline software and the background subtracted using running buffer. The integration procedure ensured that only SAXS data from the peak of interest were abstracted and subjected to further analysis. Data were inspected for radiation damage and aggregation by inspection of Guinier plots. This method ensured that SAXS data were unperturbed by any other oligomers which may have formed or been present in the analysis solution."

This is highly important, as the mechanism of activation of its more famous family member p53 is totally different. The consequences of this mechanism are extremely important to elucidate how quality control of oocytes is achieved. The data presented are of excellent quality and expand the area of TAp63 in the quality control of oocytes. Indeed, the detailed analysis of TAp63 structural analysis at the molecular level represents relevant new insight on reproductive biology as well as in understanding the mechanism of p63 regulation, as compared for example to p53. Consequently, this is a very important, highly interesting and solid study investigating the consequences of loss of p63, or its genetic mutations at the structural level."

We had provided such evidence already in the Cell paper (Deutsch et al., 2011). There we have treated oocyte lysates after irradiation showing both tetramerization as well as a shift on an SDS gel with \u03bb-phosphatase. Despite the complete removal of the shift on the SDS gel the gel filtration profile of the now non-phosphorylated TAp63\u03b1 remains virtually the same, indicating that 1) the shift is indeed due to phosphorylation and 2) that phosphorylation is only the trigger to induce the change from a dimeric to a tetrameric state, supporting our analysis that the dimeric state is a high energy kinetically trapped one. To make this more clear we have added the citation of our Cell paper to the section in which we have mentioned these experiments in the original version of the manuscript (\u201cThe dimeric conformation of TAp63\u03b1 constitutes a kinetically trapped state\u201d) and have added a few sentences in the Discussion part."

Activation through phosphorylation by Chk2 has been shown in the paper by Bolcun-Filas et al. (Science 2014) that we cite several times. They had, however, not linked activation to tetramerization. To make this link we have added experimental results to <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> that show that addition of 25 \u00b5M of a Chk2 inhibitor results in the suppression of phosphorylation and tetramerization. Furthermore, these experiments demonstrate that inhibiting the activation of TAp63\u03b1 also results in stabilization of the protein. This is consistent with earlier investigations that had shown a link between proteasomal degradation and active DNA binding and transactivation. The observation that inhibition of activation results in higher cellular protein levels of TAp63\u03b1 also supports our model that in the inhibited state the TAD is not accessible and only the open state can be degraded fast. We discuss all of this in a new paragraph at the end of the Results section."

Did the authors exclude the possibility that the observed induction of target genes is due to activation of p53 or p73?</i> The reviewers asked about the reduced cellular levels of TAp63\u03b1 following activation. As explained above this is due to fast proteasomal degradation of active p63 (see response to question #1). We have also investigated if p53 or p73 can be detected before or after irradiation in oocytes. Using immunohistochemistry, we have not been able to detect p53 and only a weak and diffuse staining for p73. The much higher concentration of p63 together with the fact that significant induction of target genes is achieved in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (preventing an increase of the cellular content of p73 through transcription by p63) strongly argues that the transcriptional effects seen are due to p63. We describe these results in the last paragraph of the Results section and provide the data in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>."
