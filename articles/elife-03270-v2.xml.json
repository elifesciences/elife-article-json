The lower pHe of tumors, confirmed by pH-sensitive PET radiotracers, MR spectroscopy and MRI (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>), contributes to local metastatic invasion (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cardone et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rofstad et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Stock et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Stock and Schwab, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Busco et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Estrella et al., 2013</a>). Increased pHi enables a number of cancer cell behaviors, including promoting cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pouyss\u00e9gur et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kapus et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Putney and Barber, 2003</a>), glycolytic metabolism (<a href=\"#bib38\">Reshkin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dietl et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Webb et al., 2011</a>), migration (<a href=\"#bib9\">Denker and Barber, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Patel and Barber, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Frantz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Stock and Schwab, 2009</a>), and invasion (<a href=\"#bib38\">Reshkin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hinton et al., 2009</a>), as well as limiting apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Matsuyama et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lagadic-Gossmann et al., 2004</a>). The higher pHi of cancer cells is paradoxical because increased production of metabolic acids generated by aerobic glycolysis would be predicted to lower pHi. However, many cancers have elevated expression or activity of proteins that facilitate increased pHi, including carbonic anhydrase 9 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Swietach et al., 2007</a>), H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (<a href=\"#bib25\">Martinez-Zaguilan et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sennoune et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hinton et al., 2009</a>), the ubiquitously expressed Na<sup>+</sup>-H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">McLean et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Miraglia et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chiang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2011</a>) and the monocarboxylate transporter family members MCT1 and MCT4 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pinheiro et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Halestrap, 2013</a>). Therapeutic targeting of these proteins to reduce H<sup>+</sup> efflux and lower pHi has been suggested for limiting cancer progression (<a href=\"#bib53\">Webb et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Harguindey et al., 2013</a>), based primarily on findings with xenograft models and isolated cells. Xenograft tumor growth is suppressed by inhibiting NHE1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lagarde et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2011</a>) or MCT1 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sonveaux et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Colen et al., 2011</a>) activity. In cell models, inhibiting NHE1 activity reduces viability of breast cancer (<a href=\"#bib39\">Reshkin et al., 2003</a>) and leukemic cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rich et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Reshkin et al., 2003</a>), and silencing MCT4 expression with RNA interference decreases survival of renal carcinoma cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gerlinger et al., 2012</a>). Although previous studies suggest important roles for pH dynamics in regulating cancer cell behaviors, whether increased pHi is sufficient or necessary for cancer progression in vivo remains unresolved."

Second, is H<sup>+</sup> efflux by NHE1 necessary for oncogene-induced dysplasia? We found that over-expression of <i>Drosophila melanogaster Dnhe2</i>, an ortholog of mammalian NHE1, causes dysplasia, increases proliferation and facilitates oncogene-induced cell invasion in vivo. Additionally, we found that reducing H<sup>+</sup> efflux genetically or pharmacologically limits oncogene-induced increases in proliferation and has synthetic lethality with oncogenic Raf in the <i>Drosophila</i> retina as well as in human mammary epithelial cells expressing oncogenic RasV12."

In wild type <i>Drosophila</i>, the adult eye is a precisely patterned epithelial structure with hexagonal unit eyes, termed ommatidia, uniformly arrayed across the surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, left). Wild type ommatidia contain eight photoreceptor neurons (R cells), forming a polarized, asymmetrical trapezoid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, tracing in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, left). In <i>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</i> flies, ommatidial organization was disrupted and individual facets were irregular in shape and size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, middle). In section, <i>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</i> retinae had misoriented ommatidia, abnormal cell fates and missing R cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>, middle).

We also used <i>eyelessGAL4</i> to express <i>Dnhe2</i> earlier in eye development, which caused a very mild rough eye phenotype. To resolve whether increased H<sup>+</sup> efflux by <i>Dnhe2</i> is necessary for disrupted tissue architecture we generated transgenic flies expressing a mutant <i>Dnhe2</i><sup><i>E358I</i></sup>, analogous to the NHE1<sup>E266I</sup> mutation that abrogates H<sup>+</sup> efflux (<a href=\"#bib9\">Denker and Barber, 2002</a>).

Expression of <i>RasV12</i> induced a wider <i>ptc &gt; GFP</i> stripe compared to control (\u223c1.6-fold increase), while expression of <i>Dnhe2</i> alone did not (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). However, co-expression of <i>RasV12</i> and <i>Dnhe2</i> markedly increased the <i>ptc &gt; GFP</i> stripe width greater than twofold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We also observed a significant increase in the overall size of the wing disc with <i>ptc &gt; RasV12</i>, <i>Dnhe2</i> compared with either transgene alone or wild type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,D</a>). To determine invasive phenotypes, we identified single GFP-positive cells in stacks of confocal images.

However, in <i>ptc &gt; RasV12</i>, <i>Dnhe2</i> discs, we found examples of invasive cells in all discs examined. Further, we found several different types of invasive behaviors, including basal expansion of the <i>ptc</i> stripe, single invasive cells and streams of cells migrating out of the stripe into neighboring tissue in the posterior compartment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These data show cell autonomous effects of <i>Dnhe2</i> expression on growth and migration behaviors, as well as non-autonomous effects on tissue growth."

In clonal human mammary MCF10A cells we found that loss of NHE1 activity lowers pHi and increases cell death selectively in cells expressing oncogenic RasV12. We first used an estrogen receptor-induced H-RasV12 (ER-RasV12) and suppressed NHE1 expression with shRNA. Tamoxifen-induced Ras expression markedly increased rate of pHi recovery from an acid load (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Tamoxifen increased pHi in ER-Ras cells and with NT shRNA but not in vector control cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). However, with NHE1 shRNA pHi was significantly lower (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), indicating NHE1 is necessary for increased pHi with oncogenic Ras. Tamoxifen treatment increased NHE1 expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), while NHE1 shRNA treatment significantly reduced NHE1 protein expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>; two different NHE1 shRNA constructs showed similar results). A similar NHE1-dependent increase in pHi was shown using MCF10A cells stably expressing H-RasV12 (sRasV12) and 5(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) to pharmacologically inhibit NHE1 activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>). As a control, we show that EIPA treatment does not effect Ras expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). Although pHi was higher in MCF10A cells with RasV12 and inhibited NHE1 activity than in <i>Drosophila Dnhe2</i><sup><i>null</i></sup>; <i>GMR &gt; Raf</i> pupal eyes, measuring pHi of cultured cells requires washes that could remove less adherent, dying cells with a lower pHi.

Dysregulated pHi is an emerging hallmark of cancer that is associated with traditional hallmarks, including resisting cell death, sustaining proliferative signaling, activating invasion and metastasis, deregulating cellular energetics and tumor-promoting inflammation.

Building on previous reports that NHE1 activity and expression is increased in human cancers (<a href=\"#bib27\">McLean et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Miraglia et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chiang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2011</a>), we show that engineered over-expression of an NHE1 ortholog in vivo increased pHi by \u223c0.3 pH units, which is comparable to the increase seen with oncogene transformation. Moreover, over-expression of <i>Dnhe2</i> was sufficient to induce dysplasia and hyper-proliferation phenotypes, and it enhanced oncogene-mediated invasion. Further, co-expressing <i>RasV12</i> and <i>Dnhe2</i> had a strong, synergistic effect on growth and invasion. A similar synergistic effect between expression of <i>RasV12</i> and the C subunit of the V-ATPase, <i>Vha44</i> was recently reported (<a href=\"#bib33\">Petzoldt et al., 2013</a>), which supports the ability of increased H<sup>+</sup> efflux to enhance RasV12-induced phenotypes. However, <i>Vha44</i> enhances invasion with RasV12 but not activated Src or Abl, suggesting an oncogene-specific synergy. Important to determine in future studies are the relative effects of increased pHi on growth and invasion, and whether decreased pHe contributes to the non-autonomous effects we observed in imaginal discs."

Previous studies identified distinct responses to reduced H<sup>+</sup> efflux, such as tumor growth in xenograft models (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lagarde et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sonveaux et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Colen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2011</a>) or viability of isolated cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rich et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Reshkin et al., 2003</a>). We now show progressive effects of limiting H<sup>+</sup> efflux with oncogene expression, including initially suppressing hyper-proliferation and dysplasia, followed by decreasing pHi, and culminating in a synthetic lethal interaction with histological features of coagulative necrosis. Coagulative necrosis is characteristically found within the central region of solid tumors (<a href=\"#bib43\">Searle et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lagarde et al., 1988</a>), and is thought to be induced by extreme physiological cellular stresses. Removing <i>Dnhe2</i> in an otherwise wild type genetic background decreased pHi but had no effect on larval tissue morphology. <i>Dnhe2</i><sup><i>null</i></sup> retinal pHi in pupae was slightly higher than in larvae but not significantly different compared with wild type. These data suggest that in the absence of <i>Dnhe2</i>, pHi homeostasis during metamorphosis can be maintained by alternative ion transport mechanisms, changes in cellular buffering capacity and/or metabolic changes. While our <i>Drosophila</i> studies evaluate synthetic lethality in the ~20% <i>Dnhe2</i> homozygous mutant \u2018escaper\u2019 flies that survive to eclosion, our studies in several transformed cell lines also show a synthetic lethality interaction, suggesting a conserved mechanism. The synthetic lethal interaction we observed suggests H<sup>+</sup> efflux is necessary for dissipating oncogene-generated acids, most likely from increased glycolytic metabolism. Our studies further show that these lethal interactions occur in two genetically complex, physiologically adapted invasive tumor cell lines."

Second, the rough eye phenotype induced with <i>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</i> provides a new model for genetic screens to identify pH-sensitive pathways and previously unrecognized pH sensors regulating cell growth and tissue architecture. Dysplasia with increased pHi in the absence of oncogenes is likely in part dependent on cancer-promoting pH sensors (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sch\u00f6nichen et al., 2013</a>), including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the actin regulatory protein cofilin that support tumor growth and metastasis (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cance et al., 2013</a>) and have increased activity at higher pHi (<a href=\"#bib13\">Frantz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Choi et al., 2013</a>).

Briefly, retinae were dissected from wandering third instar larvae or from 42H apf pupae in HCO<sub>3</sub> buffer (25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 115 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM KHPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and mounted in MatTek glass-bottom dishes. Fluorescent images were collected on an inverted spinning disk confocal microscope (<a href=\"#bib47\">Stehbens et al., 2012</a>). NIS Elements software was used to subtract background and measure fluorescence intensity in pHluorin and mCherry channels. For larval measurements, fluorescence intensity measurements were collected from 3 ROI per eye disc, with each ROI comprising \u223c7 ommatidia. For pupal measurements, fluorescence intensity values in single cells were measured for 10 cells per type per eye; cell types were identified by their stereotyped morphology at either the apical surface (cone cells, primary, secondary and tertiary pigment cells) or in the middle of the retinal epithelium (photoreceptor neurons). Ratiometric calculations and statistical analyses were performed in Microsoft Excel. To generate a standard curve for each genotype, tissue was incubated for 20\u201340 min in nigericin buffer (25 mM HEPES, 105 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 \u00b5M nigericin [Invitrogen]) at defined pH points (\u223c6.5, \u223c7.0 and \u223c7.5). We did observe a difference in pHi in wild type between our two sets of experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, which we attribute to alterations in our imaging systems made between the sets of experiments.
