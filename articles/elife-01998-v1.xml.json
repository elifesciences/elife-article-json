                    "text": "Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a key regulator of many cellular signaling pathways. Unlike most kinases, GSK-3 is controlled by inhibition rather than by specific activation. In the insulin and several other signaling pathways, phosphorylation of a serine present in a conserved sequence near the amino terminus of GSK-3 generates an auto-inhibitory peptide. In contrast, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal transduction requires phosphorylation of Ser/Pro rich sequences present in the Wnt co-receptors LRP5/6, and these motifs inhibit GSK-3 activity. We present crystal structures of GSK-3 bound to its phosphorylated N-terminus and to two of the phosphorylated LRP6 motifs. A conserved loop unique to GSK-3 undergoes a dramatic conformational change that clamps the bound pseudo-substrate peptides, and reveals the mechanism of primed substrate recognition. The structures rationalize target sequence preferences and suggest avenues for the design of inhibitors selective for a subset of pathways regulated by GSK-3."

Unlike most kinases, GSK-3 is controlled by inhibition rather than by specific activation. In the insulin and several other signaling pathways, phosphorylation of a serine present in a conserved sequence near the amino terminus of GSK-3 generates an auto-inhibitory peptide. In contrast, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal transduction requires phosphorylation of Ser/Pro rich sequences present in the Wnt co-receptors LRP5/6, and these motifs inhibit GSK-3 activity. We present crystal structures of GSK-3 bound to its phosphorylated N-terminus and to two of the phosphorylated LRP6 motifs. A conserved loop unique to GSK-3 undergoes a dramatic conformational change that clamps the bound pseudo-substrate peptides, and reveals the mechanism of primed substrate recognition. The structures rationalize target sequence preferences and suggest avenues for the design of inhibitors selective for a subset of pathways regulated by GSK-3."

When a cell detects the hormone insulin, for example, another enzymes adds a phosphate group to a site near one end of GSK-3 to switch it off.

GSK-3 has two isoforms in vertebrates, \u03b1 and \u03b2, that share 97% identity in their catalytic cores but have different N- and C-terminal extensions. GSK-3 prefers pre-phosphorylated substrates, termed \u2018primed\u2019 substrates, with a phosphorylated serine or threonine residue at the position 4 residues C-terminal (P+4) to the serine or threonine to be phosphorylated (P+0) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fiol et al., 1987</a>).

Crystal structures of GSK-3 obtained in the absence of nucleotide and/or peptide substrate reveal an ordered activation loop similar in conformation to that found in other kinases when the loop is phosphorylated. GSK-3 also shows no evidence for movements of the C-helix critical for positioning of catalytically important residues (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jura et al., 2011</a>). GSK-3 can be phosphorylated at a tyrosine (Tyr216) on its activation loop, which increases enzymatic activity approximately fivefold, a modest increase compared to the activation of other kinases (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dajani et al., 2003</a>)."

For example, in the absence of Ser9 phosphorylation, GSK-3 phosphorylates glycogen synthase and renders it less active, and inactivates eIF2B. Binding of insulin to its cell surface receptor results in the activation of the kinase AKT/PKB, which phosphorylates the conserved N-terminal peptide, resulting in increased glycogen and protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cross et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Frame and Cohen, 2001</a>). The phosphorylated sequence, designated here as the pS9 peptide, is thought to auto-inhibit GSK-3 by acting as a pseudo-substrate that blocks binding of other substrates (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dajani et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Frame et al., 2001</a>)."

Binding of a Wnt growth factor to its cell surface receptors Frizzled and LRP5/6 results in the stabilization of the transcriptional co-activator \u03b2-catenin and activation of target genes. In the absence of Wnt, \u03b2-catenin is found in a \u2018destruction complex\u2019 that includes GSK-3, casein kinase 1 (CK1), the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli protein, and Axin. Axin has binding sites for \u03b2-catenin, GSK-3 and CK1, and thereby scaffolds efficient phosphorylation of the N-terminus of \u03b2-catenin, which marks \u03b2-catenin for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stamos and Weis, 2013</a>). The association with Axin sequesters a fraction of cytosolic GSK-3 in the destruction complex, which likely prevents interactions with regulatory proteins not involved in Wnt signaling, including kinases that target Ser9. Mutation of GSK-3\u03b2 Ser9 does not affect Wnt signaling, and this residue does not become phosphorylated during Wnt stimulation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ding et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">McManus et al., 2005</a>).

The five repeats, designated a-e, have the consensus sequence P-P-P-S/T-P-X-S/T, where each of the S/T residues becomes phosphorylated in response to Wnt (<a href=\"#bib46\">Niehrs and Shen, 2010</a>). Several kinases, including GSK-3 itself, may be responsible for phosphorylating the first Ser/Thr residue of the motif (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zeng et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cervenka et al., 2011</a>). Phosphorylation of this site forms a primed substrate recognition sequence for CK1, which then phosphorylates the second Ser/Thr residue (<a href=\"#bib15\">Davidson et al., 2005</a>). Current models suggest that the phospho-LRP6 motifs can directly inhibit GSK-3 phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin by engaging the kinase as a pseudo-substrate (<a href=\"#bib48\">Piao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2013a</a>).

However, the inhibition by the LRP5/6 cytoplasmic domain demonstrates that other modes of inhibition can operate. We set out to assess the mechanistic similarities and differences between inhibition by N-terminal phosphorylation and inhibition mediated by the phosphorylated LRP5/6 motifs."

Here we show that the auto-inhibitory pS9 peptide sequence and the inhibitory LRP6 c- and e-motifs all bind to GSK-3 as pseudo-substrates. Unique to GSK-3, binding is associated with a drastic conformational rearrangement of a highly conserved loop that engages the inhibitory peptides in a clamp-like structure. Peptide binding promotes a conformation of a glycine-rich loop that is associated with catalytic activity in other protein kinases. The LRP6 peptide complexes support a model in which phosphorylated receptor acts to inhibit GSK-3 directly and thereby promote \u03b2-catenin stabilization. The interactions between GSK-3 and the different inhibitory peptides help to explain substrate sequence preferences. The remodeling of the enzyme around peptide substrates suggests novel avenues for the development of GSK-3 inhibitors specific to particular pathways."

This lower conformation could not be modeled in the LRP6 c-motif complex, although the refined Fo-Fc electron density suggests that it may be present at very low occupancy. In the pS9 complex, both Ser66 and Phe67 now adopt positions nearly identical to those of Ser53 and Phe54 of PKA bound to the transition state analog ADP+AlF<sub>3</sub> and a peptide (<a href=\"#bib39\">Madhusudan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Phe67 packs against the threonine at the P+2 residue of the pS9 peptide, and although Ser66 and Phe67 are poorly ordered in the LRP6 c- and e-motif complexes, modeling them in the same position as that observed in the pS9 complex shows that Phe67 can pack against the P+2 proline of the LRP6 peptides. Mutation of GSK-3\u03b2 Phe67 to alanine severely impairs catalytic activity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ilouz et al., 2006</a> and MDE, data not shown), suggesting that the packing of this residue against the substrate peptide is important for stabilizing a catalytically active conformation."

The interaction between Phe67 and the P+2 residue of a substrate, and the movement of the \u03b2 strand adjacent to the glycine-rich loop that occurs when the C-loop engages the substrate peptide, may favor the lower conformation of the glycine-rich loop seen here. For example, Phe67 is found in several positions in peptide inhibitor-free GSK-3 structures, and some of them (e.g., PDB 1PYX) would clash with the C-loop in the peptide-bound structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

However, we do not observe the P+0 residue in any of our structures, which leaves open the possibility that the observed binding mode is distinct from that of true substrates. We compared the orientation of the observed residues by superposition of several known Ser/Thr kinase:peptide substrate complex structures in which the P+0 residue is observed. The P+1 residue in these complexes, as well as that of the PKA inhibitor PKI, aligns very well with those of the GSK-3 inhibitory peptides, and is oriented similarly such that the P+0 residue would be correctly positioned to accept a phosphate from ATP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Combined with the effect of the conformation of the glycine-rich loop, it appears that the observed binding mode of the inhibitory peptides corresponds closely to the binding mode of true GSK-3 substrates."

In addition to the main-chain interactions observed between GSK-3 and the inhibitory peptides, GSK-3\u03b2 Phe93 packs against residues at the P+2 and P+5 positions of the inhibitor peptides. Given that the inhibitor peptides appear to bind as pseudo-substrates and stabilize an active conformation of GSK-3, we tested the importance of Phe93 for GSK-3 activity by determining steady-state kinetic parameters for wild-type GSK-3\u03b2 and the F93A and F93G mutants using peIF2b as the substrate (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The mutants show 7\u20139-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>), with significant increases in K<sub>M</sub> that suggest a loss of affinity for the peptide substrate. These data indicate that the interaction with Phe93 contributes strongly to substrate binding, and the reductions in k<sub>cat</sub> are consistent with the notion that peptide binding is required for formation of a catalytically competent enzyme."

The position equivalent to Phe93 of mouse GSK-3\u03b2 is strongly conserved; the only other residue found at this position is tyrosine, which would be able to form the same interactions with the P+2 and P+5 residues of the substrate peptide. A bulkier residue such as tryptophan at this position would clash with the substrate peptide backbone, and the decreased activity of the F93A mutant suggests that smaller residues would not extend far enough to interact with the substrate. In the absence of pseudo-substrate inhibitors, Phe93 does not interact with other parts of the kinase and is present on a solvent exposed, flexible loop. Thus, the conservation of Phe or Tyr residue at this position must be attributed to its role in substrate binding and concomitant formation of an active kinase conformation."

The P+2 position has 43% hydrophobic and 79% uncharged residues, consistent with a relatively hydrophobic environment created by the two phenylalanines. The P+5 position has 63% hydrophobic and 81% uncharged residues, with a strong preference for proline, which makes extensive interactions with Phe93 in the LRP6 peptide complexes. Interestingly, only 5 of the 75 targets in <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> contain charged residues at both the P+2 and P+5 positions. Also, tryptophan is completely excluded at these positions, and phenylalanine and tyrosine only appear four times total out of the 75 sequences listed. We speculate that large aromatic residues might interact too strongly with Phe93 and thereby reduce turnover of the enzyme. Alternatively, at least in the P+2 position, large aromatic residues may sterically clash with Phe93 or the nearby Tyr216 or Phe67 residues."

The presence of the pS9 or LRP6 peptides, however, precludes this positioning for Tyr216. Instead, it points outward, away from the peptide, and adopts an identical conformation to that seen when it is phosphorylated, where it interacts with several basic residues (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bax et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dajani et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In the inhibitory peptide complexes, the ring of Tyr216 packs against the P+1 residue. These observations are consistent with the modest increase in GSK-3 activity when Tyr216 is phosphorylated: in order to accommodate binding of the substrate peptide, Tyr216 must move away from its unphosphorylated position and break its interaction with Val214. Having phosphorylated Tyr216 pre-positioned for substrate binding would not require the extra energy needed for this rearrangement."

However, arginine is found in this position in 19% of the substrates, including the inhibitory pS9 peptide, where its \u03b2 carbon packs against Tyr216. When GSK-3 is phosphorylated at Tyr216, the charged phosphate group on pTyr216 would be located near the distal end of the P+1 residue. Modeling shows that the phosphate group could interact with the positively charged moiety of arginine at P+1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). These observations suggest that GSK-3 substrate specificity may be controlled in part through Tyr216 phosphorylation status, with substrates containing smaller or hydrophobic residues at P+1 preferred when Tyr216 is not phosphorylated and basic residues preferred when phosphorylated. If so, potential tyrosine kinases mediating Tyr216 phosphorylation or factors that promote autophosphorylation of Tyr216 may favor phosphorylation of particular substrates and thereby provide an additional level of regulation of GSK-3 function (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lochhead et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kaidanovich-Beilin and Woodgett, 2011</a>)."

Although the C-loop is often poorly ordered in non-peptide-bound structures, it interacts directly with the inhibitory peptides, and the loss of activity resulting from mutation of Phe93 demonstrates the critical nature of this interaction. The C-loop interactions, coupled with changes in the position of the glycine-rich loop, create an arrangement of catalytic residues comparable to those observed in PKA bound to the transition state mimic ADP-AlF<sub>3</sub> and a peptide substrate (<a href=\"#bib39\">Madhusudan et al., 2002</a>). These observations, as well as comparison to structures of other kinases bound to substrates, indicate that the inhibitory peptides act as true pseudo-substrates that mimic binding to substrate, rather than stabilizing a distinct catalytically inactive conformation of GSK-3."

Several studies have shown that phosphorylated LRP5/6 can directly inhibit GSK-3 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Piao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wu et al., 2009</a>). This suggests a model in which recruitment of the destruction complex to the Wnt-bound receptors occurs when activated Dishevelled binds to Axin through their respective DIX domains. GSK-3 bound to Axin would phosphorylate LRP5/6 and generate its own inhibitor, thereby selectively inhibiting the pool of GSK-3 that phosphorylates \u03b2-catenin without affecting other GSK-3 activities (<a href=\"#bib48\">Piao et al., 2008</a>). The kinetic and structural data presented here demonstrate that the phosphorylated LRP6 repeat motifs act as direct inhibitors of GSK-3 catalytic activity. The 40-fold stronger inhibitory activity relative to that of phosphorylated GSK-3 N-terminus is consistent with the LRP5/6 motifs working in <i>trans</i>, as opposed to the presumed kinetic advantage of having the GSK-3 N-terminal inhibitory substrate part of the same polypeptide chain, although formation of membrane associated \u2018signalosome\u2019 complexes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bilic et al., 2007</a>) likely enhances the probability of encounter between Axin-bound GSK-3 and LRP5/6."

Interestingly, a glutamate residue (Glu12) is present at a similar position on the pS9 auto-inhibitory peptide, which we also do not observe. It is possible that the negative charge present at this position contributes to a relatively non-specific electrostatic interaction in a flexible region. However, previous experiments indicated that there was no increase in inhibitory activity toward GSK-3 of the doubly phosphorylated LRP6 peptide vs a peptide bearing only the first phosphorylated S/T (<a href=\"#bib48\">Piao et al., 2008</a>). The second phosphorylation site may instead provide an additional site of interaction for another protein, as this region of LRP6 is accessible to solvent. One example could be an additional domain of Axin itself, as Axin has been shown to interact directly with the phosphorylated PPSP motif in the absence of GSK-3 (<a href=\"#bib37\">MacDonald and He, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2013b</a>)."

Inhibiting GSK-3 in these pathways while not promoting oncogenesis through aberrant \u03b2-catenin signaling is a challenge. Many kinase inhibitors in use today are based on interactions with the nucleotide-binding region, with elaborations that target unique features of the particular enzyme. Such inhibitors would be non-selective towards the various substrates of GSK-3. Some recently developed compounds target portions of the kinase not directly involved in nucleotide binding, especially activating or inhibiting conformations of the C-helix, for example clinically approved drugs toward the Abl and EGFR tyrosine kinases (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jura et al., 2011</a>). The peptide substrate-bound GSK-3 conformation observed in the crystal structures presented here suggests that it may be possible to target the three-dimensional structure formed by the rearranged C-loop in order to select for specific substrate-bound forms of GSK-3. The projection of the P+3 substrate residue inward toward a pocket formed by the rearranged C-loop (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) may provide a binding surface for small molecules that interact with a particular substrate sequence at this position. Such a compound would stabilize the bound conformation and prevent turnover of a specific substrate, enabling selective targeting of one pathway controlled by GSK-3."

A typical reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and 112.5 \u03bcM \u03b3<sup>32</sup>P-ATP at 0.02 \u03bcCi/\u03bcL (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and 224 nM GSK-3\u03b2. All measurements were performed at 30\u00b0C. The substrate peptide concentration was 20 \u03bcM or 80 \u00b5M for the inhibition assays and was varied for the determination of K<sub>M</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> values. Inhibitor peptide was added at concentrations ranging from 50\u20131000 \u03bcM for the pS9 peptide and 5\u201320 \u03bcM for the LRP6 a-motif. For each measurement, a 20 \u03bcl sample was removed from the reaction and mixed immediately with 20 \u03bcl of 150 mM phosphoric acid. 35 \u03bcl of the resulting solution was then blotted onto a 96-well plate containing P81 cellulose phosphate paper and washed 5 or 10 times with 0.5% phosphoric acid. Scintillation fluid was then added, and the plate was counted in a Wallac MicroBetta 1450 liquid scintillation counter. Control reactions performed in the absence of substrate peptide showed that signal from GSK-3 autophosphorylation was not significant. Rates were calculated from the slope of the linear regression fit of <sup>32</sup>P incorporation vs time."

These structures are noteworthy as they contain phosphorylated inhibitory motifs from the N-terminus of GSK3 itself or derived from the Wnt signaling pathway protein LRP6. These structures reveal that the inhibitory motifs bind as predicted for primed pseudosubstrates to the enzyme in its active conformation. A special feature of the complex is the presence of an extensive interaction between the C-loop and the substrate/inhibitory motif which undergoes a significant conformational change compared to the inhibitor-free structure. These structures may also help us understand how GSK3 substrate recognition occurs and in fact how Tyr216 phosphorylation may modulate substrate specificity. This study gives insight into how Tyr216 phosphorylation can modestly activate the kinase. The conserved nature of GSK3 Phe93, from the C-loop, is now explained and tested here by mutagenesis, showing its importance. A role of a conserved Arg in GSK3 interacting with the phospho-site of the primed substrate is suggested. Some technically impressive aspects of the study include the use of chimeric LRP6-GSK3 to capture the inhibited conformation and the use of kinases to obtain cleanly phosphorylated GSK3 for crystallization, and the use of ALF3- to visualize the \u201ctransition state\u201d. Overall, this is a well-done and significant manuscript that should be of broad interest to <i>eLife</i> readers."

It would be helpful if the authors could compare their rate constants with any other GSK3 rate constants recorded in the literature to see if this has been found in other labs. The background phosphate values (time zero) are quite high at low inhibitor peptide as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and get lower with increasing inhibitor peptide additions. It would be helpful if the authors could comment on why this might be the case and also indicate how they dealt with this in calculating rates.

This likely corresponds to the transition between a burst phase and steady-state kinetic regime. In these experiments, ATP and inhibitor peptides (or control with no inhibitor) were preincubated with enzyme prior to addition of the substrate peptide. The rapid burst in the absence of inhibitor peptide can be attributed to rapid binding of substrate peptide, which reduces the time needed to form the ES complex. In the presence of preincubated inhibitor peptide, however, formation of the ES complex requires dissociation of the inhibitor peptide from the enzyme, so an initial fast turnover does not occur. Although this difference may ultimately give some interesting insights into the actual mechanism of the enzyme, the point of this figure is to compare the relative inhibitory potencies of the S9 and LRP6 a-motif peptides."

We attempted in vitro phosphorylation using AKT for native GSK-3, or CK1 for the LRP6 chimeras, but we obtained only a few percent phosphate incorporation (measured by mass spectrometry). As GSK-3 is not efficiently phosphorylated, the extreme concentration of GSK-3 along with AKT (or CK1 for the LRP6 chimeras) produced by dialysis against high molecular weight PEG enabled sufficient production of the phosphorylated enzyme for crystallization.
