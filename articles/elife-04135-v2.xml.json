A differential centrifugation protocol similar to that described in our previous study (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ge et al., 2013</a>) was performed with lysed cell preparations followed by incubation of membranes under conditions that promote the lipidation of LC3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Consistent with the previous result (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ge et al., 2013</a>), the 25K membrane from untreated cells had the highest activity whereas neither the 3K nor the 100K membrane pellet fractions had comparable activity (\u223c1/7 and 1/3 of the activity of the 25K membrane in the 3K and 100K membrane respectively, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Starvation or PI3K inhibition did not substantially affect the lipidation activity in the 3K or 25K fractions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). However, the 100K membrane from starved cells, mainly containing small vesicles, displayed a \u223c1.5-fold increase of lipidation activity compared to that of membranes from untreated cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Addition of PI3K inhibitors to cells during starvation abolished the increase of lipidation activity in the 100K membrane induced by starvation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Therefore, starvation induces the formation of small membranes competent for LC3 lipidation in a process that requires activation of the PI3K."

Consistent with our previous result, lipidation activity in the 25K membranes was inhibited by PI3K inhibitors 3-MA and wortmannin as well as the PI3P blocker, FYVE domain protein, in a dose dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, PI3K inhibitors did not inhibit lipidation activity of the 100K membranes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Likewise, the FYVE domain protein was less potent in inhibiting LC3 lipidation with membranes in the 100K than the 25K pellet fraction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Nonetheless, membranes in the 100K pellet fraction remained partially sensitive to the FYVE domain protein suggesting that access of PI3P in these membranes remained critical for the recruitment of factors, such as WIPI2 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dooley et al., 2014</a>), necessary for the lipidation event. These data suggest that membranes in the 100K fraction are generated downstream of the PI3K-dependent step."

                        "text": "To determine if the small membranes were generated from a big donor organelle, we employed a cell-free small membrane formation reaction based on our previous work on the cell-free formation of COPII vesicles (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bednarek et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2005</a>). A medium-speed membrane pellet fraction from lysed <i>Atg5</i> KO MEFs was collected and incubated with <i>Atg5</i> KO MEF cytosol together with GTP and an ATP regeneration system to generate small vesicles which were concentrated by a two-step centrifugation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The LC3 lipidation reaction was performed on the slowly-sedimenting vesicles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, COPII vesicles, marked by the reporter protein SEC22B, were generated in the presence of cytosol, membrane and nucleotide (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Starvation signals from the cytosol or inhibition of PI3K activity did not affect the level of budded SEC22B (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Slowly-sedimenting vesicles generated in this reaction supported LC3 lipidation with a \u223c1.5-fold increase in lipidation activity in incubations containing cytosol from starved compared to untreated cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This stimulatory effect was compromised by addition of PI3K inhibitors during the small vesicle formation step (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Occlusion of PI3P by FYVE domain protein also attenuated the generation of small vesicles active in LC3 lipidation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with the requirement for PI3P production on the donor membrane to generate the vesicles active in the lipidation of LC3. Importantly, lipidation activity promoted by the small vesicles was resistant to PI3K inhibition but remained partly sensitive to the PI3P blocker peptide, which was similar to the behavior of the 100K membrane generated from starved cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The data indicate that a donor membrane generates these small vesicles in a starvation-induced and PI3K-dependent manner."

These events lead to the generation of PI3P on the local membrane to initiate autophagosome biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burman and Ktistakis, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mizushima et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rubinsztein et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abada and Elazar, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Feng et al., 2014</a>).

To test if COPII and COPI are involved in the generation of lipidation active vesicles, we used a COPII inhibitor SAR1 (H79G) and a COPI inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Peyroche et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ward et al., 2001</a>) in the cell-free small vesicle formation assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

Inhibition of COPII decreased LC3 lipidation in the 25K fraction but did not affect LC3 lipidation on the 100K fraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). This result is consistent with the view that COPII acts on the ERGIC membrane to generate the lipidation-active membranes, i.e. the small vesicles are downstream products of COPII budding."

Noticeably, small vesicles positive for the autophagic membrane protein ATG9 were also generated in the reaction, but in this case vesicles formed independent of PI3K or COPII (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), suggesting that this potential source of autophagosomal membrane was generated in a process distinct from that of the LC3 lipidation active vesicles.

Under normal circumstances, COPII vesicles originate from ER-exit sites (ERES) and undergo at least partial uncoating before reaching the ERGIC (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zanetti et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013</a>). Our finding of COPII vesicles budding from the ERGIC may be due to the starvation conditions used to induce autophagy. To test if COPII proteins are recruited to the ERGIC in starved cells, we incubated starved <i>Atg5</i> KO MEFs with or without wortmannin. We then isolated ERGIC membrane and immunoblotted fractions with antibodies against COPII proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Without starvation, little COPII (SEC12, SAR1A and SEC23A; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zanetti et al., 2012</a>) was detected on the ERGIC fraction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Starvation increased the distribution of the COPII machinery, SEC12, SAR1A and SEC23A, to the ERGIC whereas inhibition of PI3K reduced this relocalization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). As controls, an ER resident protein, RPN1, and an ERGIC protein, SEC22B, remained at constant levels in the ERGIC fraction isolated from untreated and starved cells. As another control, localization of COPI (\u03b2-COP) on ERGIC membranes was not regulated by starvation or wortmannin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We conclude that the conditions of starvation that induce autophagy result in the partial redistribution of COPII proteins and SEC12, the nucleotide exchange catalyst that activates SAR1 and initiates coat assembly, to the ERGIC membrane and that this change depends on active PI3K."

Starvation resulted in a qualitative and quantitative increase in the overlap between ERGIC and COPII markers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>).

Here, we provide direct evidence demonstrating ERGIC-derived COPII vesicles, induced by the autophagic PI3K, serve as a membrane template for LC3 lipidation, a key step in autophagosome biogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Recent studies indicate the importance of LC3 lipidation in a late step involving the closure of the phagophore membrane to complete the autophagosome (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kishi-Itakura et al., 2014</a>). Nonetheless, LC3 conjugation was also detected on the small phagophore membranes in the absence of VMP1, an early autophagic factor (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kishi-Itakura et al., 2014</a>). Therefore LC3 lipidation occurs in an early stage of phagophore development even though it may function later. We propose that LC3-lipidated COPII vesicles may fuse homotypically or with membrane derived from other organelles such as the ER, plasma membrane, the ATG9 compartment and mitochondria, to facilitate maturation of the phagophare as well as completion of the double-membrane autophagosome (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

The COPII vesicles we have described may contribute membrane to the PAS. ATG14 has been shown to colocalize with LC3 on the phagophore membrane (<a href=\"#bib23\">Itakura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sun et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Matsunaga et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zhong et al., 2009</a>). We showed that ATG14 and DFCP1 (a PI3P effector, <a href=\"#bib3\">Axe et al., 2008</a>) are recruited to the ERGIC in starved cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ge et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, it is possible that ATG14 may remain associated with and direct LC3-lipidated COPII vesicles to the PAS. ERGIC-localized ATG14 may be directly packaged into COPII vesicles active in LC3 lipidation. This association may be reinforced by the high curvature of COPII vesicles (60\u201380 nm; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Stagg et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zeuschner et al., 2006</a>), which are therefore a preferred binding site for the ATG14 protein (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fan et al., 2011</a>). Alternatively, cytosolic ATG14 may be recruited to COPII vesicles after the budding process."

We suggest that starvation induces the movement of a fraction of SEC12, the key membrane protein required to initiate COPII assembly (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zanetti et al., 2012</a>), from the ER to the ERGIC and that this, coupled to the activation of PI3K, permits the formation of specialized COPII vesicles that serve as the template for lipidation of LC3 and may further feed the growth of the phagophore."

In this follow-up study, the authors demonstrate that the 100KP membrane fraction also has an LC3 lipidation activity. They reveal that lipidation-active small vesicles enriched in the 100KP membrane fraction are generated from the 20KP membranes in a PI3K- and COPII-dependent manner. Finally, they show that COPII components are recruited to the ERGIC during starvation, again in a PI3K-dependent manner. These data suggest that PI3K and COPII are directly involved in generation of LC3 lipidation-active membranes from the ERGIC. This study will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of autophagosome formation."

It implies that ATG14 and LC3 do not colocalize with each other. However, many papers have reported that ATG14 colocalizes with LC3 on phagosphores/isolation membranes (Itakura et al.

In addition, it is not clear in <a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 6</a>, why the authors cannot test the presence of other ATGs (peripheral proteins) including ATG14 on the small vesicles.

This result together with our current finding that the generation of LC3 lipidation active vesicles is dependent on PI3K and PI3P suggests a model wherein the recruitment of ATG14 together with the PI3K complex to the ERGIC produces PI3P, which is required for the direction of COPII machineries to the ERGIC for the generation of LC3 lipidation active vesicles."

Starvation induced the dramatic increase of LC3 puncta indicating the stimulation of autophagosome biogenesis. Interestingly, a fraction of small LC3 puncta colocalize with SEC31A, whereas bigger LC3 puncta were separated from SEC31A. The data confirm that COPII vesicles template the lipidation of LC3.

It implies that ATG14 and LC3 do not colocalize with each other. However, many papers have reported that ATG14 colocalizes with LC3 on phagosphores/isolation membranes (Itakura et al. MBC 2008, Matsunaga et al. NCB 2009, Matsunaga et al. JCB 2010, Zhong et al. NCB 2009). It would be helpful for readers if the authors could discuss this apparent discrepancy.

In addition, it is not clear in</i> <a href=\"#fig2s6\"><i>Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 6</i></a><i>, why the authors cannot test the presence of other ATGs (peripheral proteins) including ATG14 on the small vesicles.

Our studies indicate that the ERGIC-localized PI3K functions to generate small vesicles as one template for LC3 lipidation and other researchers reported the colocalization of ATG14 with LC3-decorated phagophore. These data suggest a sequential role of ATG14 in autophagosome formation wherein it promotes the generation of LC3 lipidation-active vesicles from the ERGIC after which it may remain on these vesicles to provide one essential membrane for phagophore growth. COPII vesicles are small (60-80 nm) and highly curved and are thus ideal membrane targets for ATG14, which favors highly curved membrane (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fan et al., 2011</a>). ERGIC-derived ATG14 may be packaged into COPII vesicles and remain associated through the process of lipidation and carried forward to the creation of the PAS by the fusion of vesicles including those that carry ATG9."

Either possibility requires the determination of ATG14 in the 100 KP COPII vesicle fraction. Unfortunately, our current assay could not reliably determine the level of ATG14 in the COPII fraction as cytosolic ATG14 and most of the ATGs tested sedimented in the 100k pellet fraction, which complicated our assessment of the origin of this pool of ATG proteins. This determination requires further effort, which we feel goes beyond the scope of our Advance report. We have included the above information in the revised manuscript as suggested by the reviewers."
