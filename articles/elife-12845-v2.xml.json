                    "text": "How positional information instructs adult tissue maintenance is poorly understood. Planarians undergo whole-body regeneration and tissue turnover, providing a model for adult positional information studies. Genes encoding secreted and transmembrane components of multiple developmental pathways are predominantly expressed in planarian muscle cells. Several of these genes regulate regional identity, consistent with muscle harboring positional information. Here, single-cell RNA-sequencing of 115 muscle cells from distinct anterior-posterior regions identified 44 regionally expressed genes, including multiple <i>Wnt</i> and <i>ndk/FGF receptor-like (ndl/FGFRL</i>) genes. Two distinct FGFRL-Wnt circuits, involving juxtaposed anterior <i>FGFRL</i> and posterior <i>Wnt</i> expression domains, controlled planarian head and trunk patterning. <i>ndl-3</i> and <i>wntP-2</i> inhibition expanded the trunk, forming ectopic mouths and secondary pharynges, which independently extended and ingested food. <i>fz5/8-4</i> inhibition, like that of <i>ndk</i> and <i>wntA</i>, caused posterior brain expansion and ectopic eye formation. Our results suggest that FGFRL-Wnt circuits operate within a body-wide coordinate system to control adult axial positioning."

Planarians undergo whole-body regeneration and tissue turnover, providing a model for adult positional information studies. Genes encoding secreted and transmembrane components of multiple developmental pathways are predominantly expressed in planarian muscle cells. Several of these genes regulate regional identity, consistent with muscle harboring positional information. Here, single-cell RNA-sequencing of 115 muscle cells from distinct anterior-posterior regions identified 44 regionally expressed genes, including multiple <i>Wnt</i> and <i>ndk/FGF receptor-like (ndl/FGFRL</i>) genes. Two distinct FGFRL-Wnt circuits, involving juxtaposed anterior <i>FGFRL</i> and posterior <i>Wnt</i> expression domains, controlled planarian head and trunk patterning. <i>ndl-3</i> and <i>wntP-2</i> inhibition expanded the trunk, forming ectopic mouths and secondary pharynges, which independently extended and ingested food. <i>fz5/8-4</i> inhibition, like that of <i>ndk</i> and <i>wntA</i>, caused posterior brain expansion and ectopic eye formation. Our results suggest that FGFRL-Wnt circuits operate within a body-wide coordinate system to control adult axial positioning."

Accordingly, many genes required for regeneration are required for neoblast biology. However, some phenotypes associated with gene inhibition do not impact the capacity of animals to regenerate, but instead affect the outcome of regeneration, suggestive of a role for such genes in providing\u00a0positional information. For example, inhibition of components of the Wnt signaling pathway causes regeneration of heads in place of tails, generating two-headed animals with heads facing opposing directions (<a href=\"#bib28\">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Gurley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Iglesias et al., 2008</a>). Neoblasts are also constantly utilized for the replacement of differentiated cells during natural tissue turnover. Several striking planarian phenotypes associated with altered regional tissue identity during tissue turnover have also been identified, including hypercephalized (Wnt-signaling inhibition) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Gurley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Iglesias et al., 2008</a>) and ventralized (BMP-signaling inhibition) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Reddien et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Molina et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Orii and Watanabe, 2007</a>) planarians.

Body-wall muscle is distributed peripherally around the entire planarian body, and the known expression domains of candidate patterning molecules in muscle broadly span the AP, DV, and medial-lateral (ML) body axes, raising the possibility that muscle provides a body-wide coordinate system of positional information that controls regional tissue identity in tissue turnover and regeneration (<a href=\"#bib48\">Witchley et al., 2013</a>).

SCDE analyses of three different anterior-versus-posterior region comparisons (Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C\u2013E</a>) identified transcripts of 99 genes as differentially expressed at p&lt;0.005. To further validate the regional expression of these candidate genes, RNA probes were generated for all statistically significant transcripts (88/99 successfully amplified) and whole-mount in situ\u00a0hybridization (ISH) was performed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). 18 genes with regional expression in muscle have been previously identified (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">[Witchley et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Vogg et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Reuter et al., 2015</a>]).

The ectopic mouths and pharynges of <i>ndl-3</i> RNAi animals appeared within the trunk, posterior to the original mouth/pharynx location. This phenotype emerged both during tissue turnover in uninjured animals (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and following regeneration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In the case of regeneration, animals initially regenerated a single mouth/pharynx, but as regenerating animals grew following feeding, ectopic mouths and pharynges emerged. Inhibition of the posterior mRG <i>wntP-2/wnt11-5</i> also caused ectopic mouth and pharynx formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>), in agreement with a recent report (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sureda-G\u00f3mez et al., 2015</a>).

We utilized single-cell sequencing to map axial gene expression within the planarian muscle. Planarian muscle was previously found to express several genes with known roles in adult tissue patterning in planarians, raising the possibility that muscle functions to produce a body-wide coordinate system of positional information (<a href=\"#bib48\">Witchley et al., 2013</a>). Traditional RNA sequencing approaches to identifying candidate adult positional information in planarians is limited by the diversity of gene expression in heterogeneous tissue. The identification of a particular cell type expressing genes associated with regional tissue identity allowed application of regional single-cell sequencing to surmount this challenge. We applied this approach to the AP axis, and identified mRGs that constitute an expression map of muscle cells of the planarian primary axis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Coordinate systems of positional information, such as those proposed to control embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib6\">De Robertis et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Petersen and Reddien, 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Niehrs, 2010</a>), might exist within adult tissues of many animals, including humans (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rinn et al., 2006</a>), however there is little functional data regarding positional information and maintenance of the adult body plan. Here, we described several mRGs that work together to pattern and maintain two distinct body regions, the head and the trunk."

These results suggest that muscle, a tissue found uniformly throughout the animal, marks different AP regions through combinatorial expression of mRGs. This implies that communication exists between muscle cells and the underlying region-specific tissues. Understanding the coordination between muscle cells and tissues within AP regions is necessary for determining how planarians are able to robustly maintain and regenerate their entire body plan. Positional information must be integrated into the decision to generate and pattern new tissue during planarian growth and regeneration. mRGs might therefore influence the regional behavior of neoblasts and/or their division progeny."

In both cases, inhibition by RNAi of <i>FGFRL</i> genes (i.e., reduction or absence of the <i>FGFRL</i> expression domain) and inhibition of <i>Wnt</i> pathway components (i.e., expansion of the <i>FGFRL</i> expression domain) are coincident with the same phenotype of expanded regional identity. Future characterization of the biochemical properties of FGFRLs and elucidation of the mechanisms of interaction between Wnt/Fz pathways and FGFRLs might help in understanding this property. We propose that FGFRL proteins confine the regions where specific tissues in both the head and trunk can normally form and that the <i>Wnt</i> gene of each circuit acts by restricting tissues at the anterior end of its expression domain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Given the similarities of the distinct FGFRL-Wnt circuits for patterning two different body regions, FGFRL-Wnt circuits might be broadly utilized, but presently underappreciated, patterning modules of animal body plans."

To determine the best differential expression analysis method to identify putative mRGs, we tested three statistical methods: SCDE (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kharchenko et al., 2014</a>), bimod (<a href=\"#bib17\">McDavid et al., 2013</a>),\u00a0and t-test (Student's t-test) for their ability to identify known mRGs. For each of the statistical tests, we compared cells from the head tip (region 1) versus those from the tail tip (region 10) and determined the rank and statistical significance of 10 canonical mRGs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). Based on its ability to identify mRGs present only in a subset of cells within a region (e.g., <i>wnt11-1, sFRP-1, notum</i>), we chose SCDE for all further differential expression analysis. Note that SCDE explicitly accounts for drop-out rates due to single-cell sequencing by calculating a probability distribution for each transcript in each cell before calculating differential expression between groups. To identify putative mRGs, we performed three differential expression analyses: anterior (regions 1, 2, 3; n=23 cells) versus posterior (regions 8, 9, 10; n=38 cells); head (region 1; 11 cells) versus post-pharyngeal (regions 7, 8, 9; n=35 cells); pre-pharyngeal (regions 2, 3, 4; n=22 cells) versus tail (region 10; n=12 cells) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

For RNAi enhancement experiments of <i>ndl-3; wntP-2</i> RNAi with \u03b2<i>-catenin-1</i>, animals were fed five times with a combination of <i>ndl-3</i> and <i>wntP-2</i>, and starting in the sixth feeding, \u03b2<i>-catenin-1</i> or control dsRNA was added to the mix of <i>ndl-3</i> and <i>wntP-2</i> for another three, four, or five feedings (being a total of eight, nine or 10 feedings, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). For the \u03b2-<i>catenin-1</i> RNAi experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, animals were fed once, twice, or four times with \u03b2-<i>catenin-1</i> or control dsRNA. Animals were fixed at different days after the first RNAi feeding."

Briefly, total RNA was isolated from fragments from individual intact worms or from individual regenerated fragments, as indicated by cartoons in figures, in 0.75mL Trizol (Life Technologies,\u00a0Carlsbad,\u00a0CA) following manufacturer's instructions. Samples were homogenized for 30s using TissueLyser II (Qiagen). Following RNA purification and resuspension in dH20, concentrations for each sample were measured by Qubit using RNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies). 5 ng of RNA were treated with 1U amplification-grade DNAse I (Life Technologies) for 15\u2009min at room temperature before DNAse heat-inactivation for 10\u2009min at 65\u00b0C in the presence of 2.5\u2009mM EDTA. Multiplex reverse-transcription and 15 cycles of PCR amplification were performed on DNAse-treated RNA using pooled outer primers at 50 nM each and Superscript III/Platinum Taq enzyme mix (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>). Following outer primer digestion with ExoI (15U, New England Biolabs,\u00a0Ipswich,\u00a0MA), samples were diluted to 500pg/ul and checked for presence of <i>g6pd</i> by qRT-PCR (7500 Fast PCR System, Applied Biosystems). Samples and inner primers were loaded onto a 96.96 Dynamic Array Fast IFC chip (Fluidigm BioMark) and analyzed as described (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>, [<a href=\"#bib23\">Owen et al., 2015</a>]). Ct values from two technical replicates were averaged and normalized by the average Ct value of three housekeeping genes (<i>g6pd, clathrin,</i> and <i>ubiquilin,</i> [<a href=\"#bib44\">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>]) to generate \u0394Ct values. Log<sub>2</sub> fold-changes were determined by the \u0394\u0394Ct method by calculating the difference from the average \u0394Ct value of control RNAi replicates. Heatmap of average \u0394\u0394Ct values was generated by pheatmap in R. Bar graphs show mean \u0394\u0394Ct +/- standard deviation with individual \u0394\u0394Ct values. Statistical tests (unpaired Student\u2019s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test) were performed between individual \u0394\u0394Ct values."

In order to describe the heterogeneity of signals transcribed by muscles, and how those signals may change along the axis of the worm, the authors use single cell RNA deep sequencing of 115 muscle cells isolated from different axial levels. This manuscript identifies genes that are expressed regionally along the anterior/posterior axis in planarian body wall muscle, which are thought to provide a coordinate system for axial information. Trying several analysis methods, the authors settle on one and then perform an in situ hybridization screen of 252 transcripts to look for regionally restricted transcripts. The RNA sequencing of single muscle cells identified 44 new regionally-expressed genes, many of which are members of the Wnt, FGFRL, and Hox gene families. Knockdown of these genes resulted in two overall classes of phenotypes: those that affect trunk identity, with formation of ectopic mouths, and those that affect anterior identity, with formation of ectopic photoreceptors. In both cases, the genes required for head or trunk identity consist of one Wnt and one FGFRL, suggesting that these proteins may form a regulatory circuit conveying regional axial information to underlying tissues in the animal."

The additional 9 mRGs verified by in situ hybridization came from 168 genes below the significant p-value in the SCDE analyses. The reason for including these 168 non-significant genes was because of the absence of a few previously known mRGs within the 99 (p-value&lt;0.005) group. mRGs that were expressed in shallow gradients (e.g., <i>sFRP-2</i>) or in very few cells (<i>wnt1, foxD, zic-1</i>) were not present within the 99 significant genes. We therefore sought to examine the possibility that the threshold of p-value&lt;0.005 was too stringent to capture all mRGs in the data. On the other hand, lowering the threshold would increase the false positive rate. We therefore tested additional genes with different significance values to seek additional mRGs. Because only 4 more mRGs (plus 5 previously known mRGs) were found with this approach, we concluded we were near saturation of the data. i.e., further sampling below the significance level threshold set would reveal mainly false positives not validated by ISH (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>, Methods subsection \u201cSingle cell differential analysis\u201d).

In the progression of the \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi phenotype, we found mild changes in distributions of FGFRL expression domains followed by large-scale re-patterning of the body (ectopic head formation) with associated large-scale FGFRL domain changes. Because of the transformation of the body plan (ectopic heads), it is difficult to make strong conclusions about the latter changes.
