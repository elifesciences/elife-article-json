Through RNA sequencing of 70 arthropod species we discovered 112 novel viruses that appear to be ancestral to much of the documented genetic diversity of negative-sense RNA viruses, a number of which are also present as endogenous genomic copies. With this greatly enriched diversity we revealed that arthropods contain viruses that fall basal to major virus groups, including the vertebrate-specific arenaviruses, filoviruses, hantaviruses, influenza viruses, lyssaviruses, and paramyxoviruses. We similarly documented a remarkable diversity of genome structures in arthropod viruses, including a putative circular form, that sheds new light on the evolution of genome organization. Hence, arthropods are a major reservoir of viral genetic diversity and have likely been central to viral evolution."

Through RNA sequencing of 70 arthropod species we discovered 112 novel viruses that appear to be ancestral to much of the documented genetic diversity of negative-sense RNA viruses, a number of which are also present as endogenous genomic copies. With this greatly enriched diversity we revealed that arthropods contain viruses that fall basal to major virus groups, including the vertebrate-specific arenaviruses, filoviruses, hantaviruses, influenza viruses, lyssaviruses, and paramyxoviruses. We similarly documented a remarkable diversity of genome structures in arthropod viruses, including a putative circular form, that sheds new light on the evolution of genome organization. Hence, arthropods are a major reservoir of viral genetic diversity and have likely been central to viral evolution."

The genetic information\u2014or genome\u2014of these viruses is encoded in strands of RNA that must be copied before they can be translated into the proteins needed to build new viruses. It is currently known that there are at least eight different families of these viruses, which have a wide range of shapes and sizes and arrange their RNA in different ways."

Many of these viruses have not previously been studied, and those that have been studied so far are mainly those that cause diseases in humans and other vertebrates. Researchers therefore only know a limited amount about the diversity of the negative-sense RNA viruses that arthropods harbor and how these viruses evolved. Studying how viruses evolve helps scientists to understand what makes some viruses deadly and others harmless and can also help develop treatments or vaccines for the diseases caused by the viruses."

Many of the newly discovered arthropod viruses appear to be the ancestors of disease-causing viruses, including influenza viruses and the filoviruses\u2014the group that includes the Ebola virus. Indeed, it appears that arthropods host many\u2014if not all\u2014of the negative-sense RNA viruses that cause disease in vertebrates and plants."

Some genomes were segmented, which may play an important role in evolution as segments can be easily swapped to create new genetic combinations. Non-segmented and circular genomes were also found. This genetic diversity suggests that arthropods are likely to have played a key role in the evolution of new viruses by acting as a site where many different viruses can interact and exchange genetic information."

Taxonomically, those negative-sense RNA viruses described to date comprise at least eight virus families and four unassigned genera or species (<a href=\"#bib12\">King et al., 2012</a>). Although they share (i) a homologous RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), (ii) inverted complementary genome ends, and (iii) an encapsidated negative-sense RNA genome, these viruses display substantial diversity in terms of virion morphology and genome organization (<a href=\"#bib12\">King et al., 2012</a>). One key aspect of genome organization is the number of distinct segments, which is also central to virus classification. Among negative-sense RNA viruses, the number of segments varies from one (order <i>Mononegavirales</i>; unsegmented) to two (family <i>Arenaviridae</i>), three (<i>Bunyaviridae</i>), three-to-four (<i>Ophioviridae</i>), and six-to-eight (<i>Orthomyxoviridae</i>) and is further complicated by differences in the number, structure, and arrangement of the encoded genes."

However, those arthropod viruses sampled to date are generally those that have a relationship with vertebrates or are known to be agents of disease (<a href=\"#bib9\">Junglen and Drosten, 2013</a>). To determine the extent of viral diversity harbored by arthropods, as well as their evolutionary history, we performed a systematic survey of negative-sense RNA viruses using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on a wide range of arthropods."

From these samples, 16 separate cDNA libraries were constructed and sequenced, resulting in a total of 147.4 Gb of 100-base pair-end reads (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Blastx comparisons against protein sequences of negative-sense RNA virus revealed 108 distinct types of complete or nearly complete large (L) proteins (or polymerase protein 1 (PB1) in the case of orthomyxoviruses) that encode the relatively conserved RdRp (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2\u20134</a>). Four additional types of previously undescribed RdRp sequence (&gt;1000 amino acids) were identified from the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) database. Together, these proteins exhibited an enormous diversity in terms of sequence variation and structure. Most notably, this data set of RdRp sequences is distinct from both previously described sequences and from each other, with the most divergent showing as little as 15.8% amino acid sequence identity to its closest relatives (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2\u20134</a>). Overall, these data provide evidence for at least 16 potentially new families and genera of negative-sense RNA viruses, defined as whose RdRp sequences shared less than 25% amino acid identity with existing taxa."

These data greatly expand the documented diversity of four viral families/orders\u2014the <i>Arenaviridae</i>, <i>Bunyaviridae</i>, <i>Orthomyxoviridae</i>, and <i>Mononegavirales</i>\u2014as well as of three floating genera\u2014<i>Tenuivirus</i>, <i>Emaravirus</i>, and <i>Varicosavirus</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">King et al., 2012</a>). Most of the newly described arthropod viruses fell basal to the known genetic diversity in these taxa: their diversity either engulfed that of previously described viruses, as in the case of phlebovirus, nairovirus, and dimarhabdovirus, or appeared as novel lineages sandwiched between existing genera or families, and hence filling in a number of phylogenetic \u2018gaps\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). One important example was a large monophyletic group of newly discovered viruses that fell between the major groups of segmented and unsegmented viruses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>); we name this putative new virus family the \u2018Chuviridae\u2019 reflecting the geographic location in China where most of this family were identified (\u2018Chu\u2019 is a historical term referring to large area of China encompassing the middle and lower reaches of the Yangzi River). Also of note was that some of the previously defined families no longer appear as monophyletic. For example, although classified as distinct families, the family <i>Arenaviridae</i> fell within the genetic diversity of the family <i>Bunyaviridae</i> and as a sister group to viruses of the genus <i>Nairovirus</i>. Furthermore, the floating genus <i>Tenuivirus</i> was nested within the Phlebovirus-like clade, and another floating genus, <i>Emaravirus</i>, formed a monophyletic group with the <i>Orthobunyavirus</i> and <i>Tospovirus</i> genera (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Hence, there are important inconsistencies between the current virus classification scheme and the underlying evolutionary history of the RdRp revealed here."

Indeed, it is striking that all vertebrate-specific segmented and unsegmented viruses (arenavirus, bornavirus, filovirus, hantavirus, influenza viruses, lyssavirus, and paramyxovirus) fall within the genetic diversity of arthropod-associated viruses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3, 5</a>). Also nested with arthropod-associated diversity were plant viruses (emaravirus, tospovirus, tenuiviruses, nucleorhabdovirus, cytorhabdovirus, and varicosavirus) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3, 5</a>). Surprisingly, our phylogeny similarly placed two non-arthropod invertebrate viruses, found in nematodes (<i>Heterodera glycines</i>) and flatworms (<i>Procotyla fluviatilis</i>), within arthropod-associated diversity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that the role of non-arthropod invertebrates should be explored further. Finally, it was striking that although individual arthropod species can harbor a rich diversity of RNA viruses, many viruses seemed to be associated with different arthropod species that share the same ecological niche (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2\u20134</a>). Interestingly, host species in the same niche had similar viral contents that were generally incongruent with the host phylogeny (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Such a pattern is indicative of frequent cross-species and occasional cross-genus virus transmission in the context of ecological and geographic proximity."

The number of genome segments in negative-sense RNA viruses varies from one to eight. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed no particular trend for this number to increase or decrease through evolutionary time (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Hence, genome segmentation (i.e., genomes with &gt;1 segment) has clearly evolved on multiple occasions within the negative-sense RNA viruses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), such that it is a relatively flexible genetic trait. Although most segmented viruses were distantly related to those with a single segment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), close phylogenetic ties were seen in other cases supporting the relatively recent evolution of multiple segments, with the plant-infecting varicosavirus (two segments) and orchid fleck virus (bipartite) serving as informative examples."

Although monophyletic, the chuviruses display a wide variety of genome organizations including unsegmented, bi-segmented, and a circular form, each of which appeared multiple times in the phylogeny (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4, 7</a>). The circular genomic form, which was confirmed by \u2018around-the-genome\u2019 RT-PCR and by the mapping of sequencing reads to the genome (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), is a unique feature of the Chuviridae and can be distinguished from a pseudo-circular structure seen in some other negative-sense RNA viruses including the family <i>Bunyaviridae</i> and the family <i>Orthomyxoviridae</i>. Furthermore, this circular genomic form was also present in both segments of the segmented chuviruses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In addition, the chuviruses displayed a diverse number and arrangement of predicted open reading frames that were markedly different from the genomic arrangement seen in the order <i>Mononegavirales</i> even though these viruses are relatively closely related (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4, 7</a>). In particular, the chuviruses had unique and variable orders of genes: the linear chuvirus genomes began with the glycoprotein (G) gene, followed by the nucleoprotein (N) gene, and then the polymerase (L) gene, whereas the majority of circular chuviruses were most likely arranged in the order L-(G)-N (i.e., if displayed in a linear form) as the only low coverage point throughout the genome lay between the 5\u2032 end of N gene and the 3\u2032 end of L gene (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In addition, the genome organizations of the chuviruses were far more concise than those of the order <i>Mononegavirales</i>, with ORFs encoding only 2\u20133 major (&gt;20 kDa) proteins (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), and hence showing more similarity to segmented viruses in this respect."

Accordingly, we were able to find the segments encoding matching structural proteins (mainly glycoproteins and nucleoproteins) for many of the viral RdRp sequences (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), although extensive sequence divergence prevented this in some cases. Surprisingly, M segments were apparently absent in a group of tick phleboviruses whose RdRps and nucleoproteins showed relatively high sequence similarity to Uukuniemi virus (genus <i>Phlebovirus</i>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Genomes with missing glycoprotein genes were also found in the chuviruses (Changping Tick Viruses 3 and 5, Wuhan Louse Viruses 6 and 7, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) and the unsegmented dimarhabdovirus (Taishun Tick Virus, Wuhan Tick Virus 1, Tacheng Tick Virus 6, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Although it is possible that the glycoprotein gene may have been replaced with a highly divergent or even non-homologous sequence, we failed to find any candidate G proteins within the no-Blastx-hit set of sequences under the following criteria: (i) structural resemblance to G proteins, (ii) similar level of abundance to the corresponding RdRp and nucleoprotein genes, and (iii) comparable phylogenies or levels of divergence (among related viruses) to those of RdRps and nucleoproteins. The cause and biological significance of these seemingly \u2018incomplete\u2019 virus genomes require further study. Finally, it was also of interest that a virus with four segments was discovered in the horsefly pool. Although the predicted proteins of all four segments showed sequence homology to their counterparts in Tenuivirus (<a href=\"#bib5\">Falk and Tsai, 1998</a>), this virus lacked the ambisense coding strategy of tenuiviruses (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). While the capability of this virus to infect plants is unknown, it is possible that it represents a transitional form between plant-infecting and arthropod-specific viruses."

As expected given their endogenous status, most of these sequences have disrupted reading frames and many are found within transposon elements, suggesting that transposons have been central to their integration. Interestingly, in some cases, such as the putative glycoprotein gene of chuviruses, the homologous EVEs from within a family (Culicidae) or even an order (Hymenoptera) form monophyletic groups (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). However, they are unlikely to be orthologous because they do not share homologous integration sites in the host genome as determined by an analysis of flanking sequences, which in turn limited the applicability of molecular-clock based dating techniques. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of those EVEs shared among different host species revealed extremely complex tree topologies which do not exhibit simple matches to the host phylogeny at both the species and genera levels (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B\u2013C</a>). In sum, these results suggest that EVEs are relative commonplace in arthropod genomes and have been often generated by multiple and independent integration events."

This is further supported by the high abundance of viral RNA in the arthropod transcriptome, as well as by the high frequencies of endogenous copies of these viruses in the arthropod genome, greatly expanding the known biodiversity of these genomic \u2018fossils\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cui and Holmes, 2012</a>). The often basal position of the arthropod viruses in our phylogenetic trees is also compatible with the idea that the negative-sense RNA viruses found in vertebrates and plants ultimately have their ancestry in arthropods, although this will only be confirmed with a far wider sample of virus biodiversity."

Furthermore, arthropods are involved in almost all ecological guilds and actively interact with other eukaryotes, including animals, plants, and fungi, such that it is possible that they serve as both sources and sinks for viruses present in the environment. In addition, not only were diverse viruses present, but they were often highly abundant. For example, in the pool containing 12 individuals (representing two species) from the Gerridae (Water striders) collected at the same site, we identified at least five negative-sense RNA viruses whose TPM values are well above 100, and where the viral RNA collectively made up more than 50% of the host total RNA (rRNA excluded). Determining why arthropods are able to carry such a large viral diversity and at such frequencies clearly merits further investigation."

It is possible that this variation is in part due to the stage or severity of infection in individual viruses and may be significantly influenced by the process of pooling, since most of our libraries contain an uneven mixture of different host species or even genera. In addition, it is possible that some low abundance viruses may in fact be derived from other eukaryotic organisms present in the host sampled, such as undigested food or prey, gut micro flora, and parasites. Nevertheless, since the majority of the low abundance viruses appear in the same groups as the highly abundant ones in our phylogenetic analyses, these viruses are most likely associated with arthropods."

The first category of infections is often associated with major vector-borne diseases (<a href=\"#bib25\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">2012</a>).

The identification of this diverse virus family provides a new perspective on the evolutionary origins of segmented and unsegmented viruses. In particular, the chuviruses occupy a phylogenetic position that is in some sense \u2018intermediate\u2019 between the segmented and unsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses and display genomic features of both. Indeed, our phylogenetic analysis reveals that genome segmentation has evolved multiple times within the diversity of chuviruses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), such that this trait appears to be more flexible than previously anticipated. In addition, the majority of the chuviruses possess circular genomes. To date, the only known circular RNA virus is (hepatitis) deltavirus, although this potentially originated from the human genome (<a href=\"#bib21\">Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 2006</a>) and requires hepatitis B virus for successful replication. As such, the chuviruses may represent the first report of autonomously replicating circular RNA viruses, which opens up an important line of future research."

Within the bunya-arena-like viruses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C, 4</a>), the three-segment structure is the most common, with the viral polymerase, nucleoprotein, and surface glycoproteins present on different segments. Notably, our phylogenetic analysis seemingly revealed independent occurrences of both increasing (Tenuivirus and Emaravirus) and decreasing (Arenavirus) segment numbers from the three-segment form (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Independent changes of genome segmentation numbers are also observed in the mononegavirales-like viruses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and, more frequently, in the chuviruses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Consequently, the number of genome segments appears to be a relatively flexible trait at a broad evolutionary scale, although the functional relevance of these changes remains unclear. While the segmented viruses (bunya-arenaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and ophioviruses) appear to be distinct from the largely unsegmented mononegavirales-like viruses in our phylogenetic analysis, this may be an artifact of under-sampling, especially given that only a tiny fraction of eukaryotes have been sampled to date. With a wider sample of eukaryotic viruses it will be possible to more accurately map changes in segment number onto phylogenetic trees and in so doing come to a more complete understanding of the patterns and determinants of the evolution of genome segmentation."

In addition, RT-PCR and sequencing over the entire genome did not reveal any break-points. As a control, the same protocol failed to connect the genome termini within the Mononegavirales, suggesting the circular genomic form is unique to the chuviruses. To further validate that these genomes are circular, we mapped the high-throughput sequencing reads to these assembled genomes. The coverage and depth were adequate throughout the genome with the exception of one location upstream to the 3\u2032 end of the ORF encoding RdRp (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). This genomic location had only 0\u201320 X coverage depending on the virus, although all RT-PCRs were successful across this location. Interestingly, sequencing of the cloned PCR products revealed extensive sequence variation (i.e., insertions and deletions) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), which is the likely cause of the low sequence coverage in this location.

However, the newly discovered diversity in other virus groups, although novel, is not as comprehensive and all-encompassing as that of the negative-sense RNA viruses described here, and tells a rather different story. In particular, the positive- and double-stranded RNA viruses (which we are still characterizing) tend to fall within the diversity of known families, rather than filling phylogenetic \u2018gaps\u2019 as is the case with the negative-sense RNA viruses. In addition, the role played by arthropods in such families as the <i>Flaviviridae</i> and the <i>Picornavirales</i> is somewhat different (and more complex) to what we present here (for example, see our recent paper on the evolutionary and genomic complexity of the <i>Flaviviridae</i>: Qin et al., PNAS, 111, 6744-6749, 2014). We therefore feel that it is difficult to present a single, coherent picture for all these RNA viruses, and that some families of positive-sense viruses will likely merit individual publications. Hence, because the negative-sense RNA viruses are a distinct phylogenetic group, we feel that it is simplest to present a stand-alone paper on these viruses, rather than greatly complicating it with the inclusion of other viral groups."

Consequently, the number of genome segments appears to be a relatively flexible trait at a broad evolutionary scale, although the functional relevance of these changes remains unclear. While the segmented viruses (bunya-arenaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and ophioviruses) appear to be distinct from the largely unsegmented mononegavirales-like viruses in our phylogenetic analysis, this may be an artifact of under-sampling, especially given that only a tiny fraction of eukaryotes have been sampled to date. With a wider sample of eukaryotic viruses it will be possible to more accurately map changes in segment number onto phylogenetic trees and in so doing come to a more complete understanding of the patterns and determinants of the evolution of genome segmentation.\u201d"

In addition, not only were diverse viruses present, but they were often highly abundant. For example, in the pool containing twelve individuals (representing two species) from the <i>Gerridae</i> (Water striders) collected at the same site, we identified at least five negative-sense RNA viruses whose TPM values are well above 100, and where the viral RNA collectively made up more than 50% of the host total RNA (rRNA excluded). Determining why arthropods are able to carry such a large viral diversity and at such frequencies clearly merits further investigation.\u201d"

We did find a large number of potential EVEs using tBlastx (please see the new <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a> in the paper). Interestingly, most of these EVE sequences have disrupted reading frames and many are found within transposon elements, suggesting that the transposons have been central to their integration. Nevertheless, and critically for the context of molecular clock dating, the EVEs we discovered do not share homologous integration sites in the host genome as revealed by an analysis of flanking sequences (i.e. they are likely not orthologous and orthology greatly aids dating). In addition, many are in short contig/scaffolds such that it is difficult to trace their locations. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of those EVEs shared among different host species revealed extremely complex tree topologies which do not reflect the host phylogeny; these are indicative of independent integration events that again prohibit effective molecular clock dating (please find an example tree in the new <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). In sum, after a careful analysis of the EVE data, we could not find any clear examples that could provide a reliable time-scale of viral evolution. In addition, the general incongruence between the (exogenous) virus and host phylogenies precluded any reliable molecular clock dating analysis. We would therefore prefer not to include any such analysis as it will clearly only add error (i.e. we cannot safely say that these dating estimates will be accurate). These points are now made in the revised version of the paper. In addition, we have added some text outlining the discovery and characterization of the novel endogenous viruses.

The threshold for match was set to 1e-05 for the e-value and 50 amino acids for matched length. The query process was reversed for each potential endogenous virus to determine their corresponding phylogenetic group. Orthologous insertion events were determined by examining flanking gene sequences. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses were carried out as described above.\u201d"

As well as novel exogenous RNA viruses, our metagenomic analysis also revealed a large number of potential EVEs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010</a>) in more than 40 arthropod species: these resembled complete or partial genes of the major proteins\u2014the nucleoprotein, glycoprotein and RdRp\u2014but without fully intact genomes (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). As expected given their endogenous status, most of these sequences have disrupted reading frames and many are found within transposon elements, suggesting that transposons have been central to their integration. Interestingly, in some cases, such as the putative glycoprotein gene of chuviruses, the homologous EVEs from within a family (<i>Culicidae</i>) or even an order (<i>Hymenoptera</i>) form monophyletic groups (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). However, they are unlikely to be orthologous because they do not share homologous integration sites in the host genome as determined by an analysis of flanking sequences, which in turn limited the applicability of molecular-clock based dating techniques. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of those EVEs shared among different host species revealed extremely complex tree topologies which do not exhibit simple matches to the host phylogeny at both the species and genera levels (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B,C</a>). In sum, these results suggest that EVEs are relative commonplace in arthropod genomes and have been often generated by multiple and independent integration events.\u201d"

However, in our case, the replicase (RdRp) domains were well conserved across the negative-sense RNA viruses such that a reliable topology could be inferred (and very similar phylogenies were obtained using both ML and Bayesian methods). In contrast, the other major viral genes (glycoproteins and nucleoprotein) are far more divergent and lack conserved domains across genera (some are not even homologous), and therefore they are not helpful in a phylogenetic analysis aimed at resolving ancient relationships. As the result, the only viable way to infer the deep phylogenetic relationships among negative-sense viruses is with the RdRp which, of course, is why there is a rich literature on the use of this gene but not any others. We therefore strongly believe that our phylogenetic analysis of RdRp is the only scientifically rigorous way to proceed."
