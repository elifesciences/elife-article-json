It has recently been proposed that such heterogeneity exists during normal embryonic development to allow position independent patterning based on \u2018salt and pepper\u2019 differentiation and sorting out. However, the molecular basis of lineage priming and how it leads to reproducible cell type proportioning are poorly understood. To address this, we employed a novel forward genetic approach in the model organism <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. These studies reveal that the Ras-GTPase regulator <i>gefE</i> is required for normal lineage priming and salt and pepper differentiation. This is because Ras-GTPase activity sets the intrinsic response threshold to lineage specific differentiation signals. Importantly, we show that although <i>gefE</i> expression is uniform, transcription of its target, <i>rasD</i>, is both heterogeneous and dynamic, thus providing a novel mechanism for heterogeneity generation and position-independent differentiation."

It has recently been proposed that such heterogeneity exists during normal embryonic development to allow position independent patterning based on \u2018salt and pepper\u2019 differentiation and sorting out. However, the molecular basis of lineage priming and how it leads to reproducible cell type proportioning are poorly understood. To address this, we employed a novel forward genetic approach in the model organism <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. These studies reveal that the Ras-GTPase regulator <i>gefE</i> is required for normal lineage priming and salt and pepper differentiation. This is because Ras-GTPase activity sets the intrinsic response threshold to lineage specific differentiation signals. Importantly, we show that although <i>gefE</i> expression is uniform, transcription of its target, <i>rasD</i>, is both heterogeneous and dynamic, thus providing a novel mechanism for heterogeneity generation and position-independent differentiation."

However, it is also possible for a group of cells to be exposed to the same signal, but for only a few to respond.

Cells within the slug turn into spores or into stalk cells, which lift the spores above the ground so that they can disperse.

Now, Chattwood et al. have shown that this process depends on the activity of two proteins; GefE and its substrate RasD. Surprisingly, both proteins are expressed many hours before cells differentiate, when cells are still well fed and dividing. Although GefE is uniformly expressed in these cells, its substrate\u2014a protein called RasD\u2014is expressed in only a subset of cells, and it is these cells that will later respond to DIF and ultimately become stalk cells."

In many cases, this is dependent on positional information, where the relative position of a cell within the embryo determines the nature or amount of instructive differentiation signals received. However, there are also a growing number of examples of position independent patterning (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kay and Thompson, 2009</a>). In these, different cell types firstly arise scattered in a \u2018salt and pepper\u2019 fashion before sorting out. To understand this mechanism, it will be important to understand why some cells differentiate, whereas neighboring cells within the same environment do not. One possible clue comes from cell culture studies that have revealed that genetically identical populations of cells exhibit heterogeneous behavior (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chambers et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wu et al., 2009</a>). When these cells receive identical doses of defined differentiation inducing signals, only a small fraction of \u2018lineage primed\u2019 cells actually respond. In this scenario, a higher inducer concentration increases the number of responding cells without affecting the magnitude of the response of individual cells. This suggests that cells exhibit different intrinsic response biases or discrete transcriptional activation thresholds to signals."

For example, in one of the earliest lineage choices made during mouse embryogenesis, cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) adopt either primitive endoderm (PrE) or epiblast (EPI) fates. This occurs in a position independent fashion with ICM cells exhibiting seemingly stochastic expression of PrE and EPI markers (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dietrich and Hiiragi, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Plusa et al., 2008</a>). It has been proposed that heterogeneity in responsiveness to differentiation inducing signals, such as the PrE inducer FGF, underlies this salt and pepper differentiation (<a href=\"#bib72\">Yamanaka et al., 2010</a>). Crucially, in this model, it is not necessary for cells to receive different levels of FGF, only that they exhibit heterogeneity in their response thresholds to the signal. Finally, following this period of \u2018symmetry breaking\u2019, coherent tissues can emerge due to a process of sorting out. Sorting is likely caused by differential gene expression resulting in differential cell motility, which can be driven by chemotaxis or differential cell adhesion (with the elimination of misplaced cells also possible)."

However, our knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanism, as to how heterogeneity affects responsiveness to differentiation signals, is still in its infancy. One route to understanding this phenomenon comes from the finding that initial cell fate choice and pattern formation in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, a genetically and biochemically tractable organism with a small number of easily recognizable cell types, is based on this mechanism (<a href=\"#bib65\">Thompson et al., 2004b</a>). Upon starvation, <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells enter a developmental cycle that begins with the aggregation of several thousand cells to make a multicellular mound. Within the mound, cells differentiate intermingled into prestalk or prespore cells. After sorting out, the different cell types are organized into discrete tissues in the migratory slug. Prestalk cells occupy the anterior 25% of the slug, with anterior like cells also found scattered within the prespore zone. Upon culmination, prestalk cells undergo extensive rearrangements to populate distinct parts of the fruiting body, including the stalk and basal disc, as well as ancillary spore head supporting structures known as the upper and lower cup. Prestalk cells can further be subdivided into several major subtypes (pstA, pstO and pstB). Each cell type is defined largely by the pattern of expression of the classical prestalk specific transcripts <i>ecmA</i> and <i>ecmB</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jermyn et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Williams et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jermyn and Williams, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Early et al., 1993</a>), and by their position in the migratory slug and final fruiting body (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Firstly, cells grown without glucose preferentially become stalk cells when mixed in chimeric development with glucose grown cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Leach et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Noce and Takeuchi, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blaschke et al., 1986</a>). Importantly, when cells from different growth conditions are compared, a hierarchy of biases results, where cells can be \u2018stalky\u2019 in one mixture but \u2018sporey\u2019 in another (<a href=\"#bib46\">Leach et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Thompson and Kay, 2000a</a>). Therefore, growth history does not commit a cell to a given fate, but is instead context dependent and relative to the growth history of the entire population. Secondly, biases established during growth have been shown to affect the sensitivity of cells to differentiation signals experienced during development, such as the chlorinated alkyl phenone DIF-1 (hereafter termed DIF), which is primarily required for pstB cell differentiation, with a more minor role in pstO cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib64\">Thompson and Kay, 2000b</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Thompson et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhukovskaya et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Huang et al., 2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Keller and Thompson, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Saito et al., 2008</a>). For example, \u2018stalky\u2019 biased cells are more sensitive to DIF in monolayer culture assays than \u2018sporey\u2019 biased cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Thompson and Kay, 2000a</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kubohara et al., 2007</a>). Finally, immediate-early gene responses to DIF exhibit all-or-none behavior, leading to population level heterogeneity (<a href=\"#bib61\">Stevense et al., 2010</a>). This provides a basis for salt and pepper differentiation in vivo, where it is presumed all cells experience similar DIF concentrations."

To address this, we have used a novel genetic approach to identify genes involved in lineage priming. Here we describe the characterization of one such gene, <i>gefE</i>, and show that its expression during growth is specifically required to determine the number of cells that respond to DIF, both in cell culture and in vivo. Finally, we show that although expression of <i>gefE</i> itself is not heterogeneous during growth, expression of its target, <i>rasD</i>, is both heterogeneous and dynamic. These studies thus establish how salt and pepper differentiation in response to a uniform diffusible signal can be achieved through the stochastic expression of a Ras gene, the activity of which in turn is dependent on a ubiquitously expressed regulatory Gef. These studies therefore provide key insights into the basis of gene regulatory networks that can underpin patterning during a poorly understood but fundamental mode of pattern formation."

Each replicate pool was then grown separately in G\u2212 medium and developed in chimera with G+ wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). After each round of development, chimeric spore heads were transferred into growth medium containing blasticidin, thus killing all wild type cells and only allowing mutant spores to grow. This provides a selective pressure to enrich for mutants that adopt the spore cell fate. The selection was repeated on each pool for seven rounds. The success of the selection was assessed qualitatively by examining the distribution of mutant and wild type cells in chimeric slugs. As expected, in initial rounds, G\u2212 grown mutant cells were enriched in the pstO and pstB populations. However, in later rounds the distribution of mutant cells changed with a clear enrichment within the prespore zone, suggesting that mutants defective in bias imposed by G\u2212 growth were becoming enriched (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>)."

In one pool, <i>gefE</i> mutant cells were enriched by round 2, whereas in the second it was only strongly enriched by round 6. These differences could be due to the effects of random genetic drift caused by harvesting a finite number of spores after each round.

For all subsequent studies, the catalytic domain disruption allele was used, but because both mutants exhibit identical phenotypes, both likely represent null alleles.

Most importantly, when wild type or <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant G\u2212 grown cells were developed in chimera with G+ wild type cells, mutant G\u2212 cells were significantly overrepresented in the spore population of chimeric fruiting bodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, p&lt;0.04), thus providing a simple explanation for the enrichment of this mutant in the genetic selection.

Similar results were seen when cells were grown in the absence of glucose (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

A lineage bias gene is one that is not required for cell fate commitment per se, but required for the <i>relative</i> probability of commitment to one fate over another. If the <i>gefE</i> gene is involved in lineage priming rather than commitment, an effect on development will not be observed if all cells in the population have the same bias (e.g., normal clonal development). We therefore examined cell fate choice and patterning of the <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant during clonal development, with all cells grown under identical conditions. Clonal development was found to be morphologically identical to that of the wild type. Furthermore, the number of prespore cells in <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant slugs was found to be the same as that observed in wild type slugs, and the total number of spores produced in terminal fruiting bodies was the same for the <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant as for the wild type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). There was also no defect in prestalk cell specific gene expression in slugs or fruiting bodies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The only difference between the clonal development of the <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> cells and the wild type was a slight, although reproducible, delay in the initiation of aggregation (data not shown). These results are, therefore, consistent with the <i>gefE</i> gene being involved in lineage priming rather than lineage commitment. Furthermore, if the <i>gefE</i> gene is involved in lineage priming, rather than commitment, then the bias of the <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> cells to avoid a DIF dependent fate, that is observed when they are mixed with wild type cells, should be reversed when they are mixed with cells of a stronger bias. Consistent with this idea, the lineage bias of the <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant cells was found to be dependent on the growth history of the partner genotype. For example, <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant cells were strongly biased <i>towards</i> DIF dependent fates when grown in the G\u2212 medium and then mixed with mutant cells grown in G+ medium (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These experiments provide strong evidence that <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> cells are totipotent and that GefE regulates context dependent/relative DIF dependent lineage bias rather than cell fate choice."

Therefore, we next tested whether <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant cells also exhibit differences in DIF responsiveness when compared to wild type cells. We found that <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant cells make fewer stalk cells than wild type across a 1000-fold range of DIF concentrations in the cAMP removal monolayer assay but exhibit similar sensitivity to changes in DIF concentration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Importantly, growth in the absence of glucose results in a similar increase in DIF sensitivity in both wild type and mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), thus suggesting that GefE is only required to set basal levels of DIF sensitivity. Similar results were seen when the effect of <i>gefE</i> disruption was observed on the expression of primary DIF target genes. In the first experiment, cells were transformed with <i>ecmAO:lacZ</i> or <i>ecmB:lacZ</i> reporter genes. DIF induced gene expression of these reporters was reduced in the <i>gefE</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> mutant compared to wild type at all DIF concentrations, but showed a similar sensitivity to changes in DIF concentration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). A similar result was seen when endogenous <i>ecmA</i> and <i>ecmB</i> transcripts were measured in response to DIF induction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Finally, we determined the effects of <i>gefE</i> disruption on an immediate-early DIF response. GATAc is a transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus minutes after DIF stimulation and is specifically required for DIF dependent pstB cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Keller and Thompson, 2008</a>). In <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant cells basal levels of nuclear GATAc were similar to wild type. Furthermore, when <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant cells were stimulated with DIF, the rate and duration of GATAc-GFP nuclear accumulation were largely unaffected. However, large differences were seen in the number of <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant cells that exhibit nuclear GATAc accumulation compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Together, these results suggest that <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> cells are less sensitive to DIF than wild type cells, consistent with the idea that GefE biases cells towards DIF sensitive fates."

It has recently been shown that DIF induced transcription of the prestalk gene, <i>ecmA</i> only occurs once a cell intrinsic threshold is exceeded; increased DIF dose only results in a small change in target gene expression level in each cell, but a much larger increase in the number of cells that respond (<a href=\"#bib61\">Stevense et al., 2010</a>). We, therefore, hypothesised that the reduced DIF responsiveness of the <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant was due to an increase in the threshold required to trigger a transcriptional response. To test this idea further, we developed a novel FACS based approach that permits <i>ecmA</i> expression levels to be measured in individual wild type or <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant cells in response to DIF. For this we replaced the endogenous copy of the <i>ecmA</i> gene with GFP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), and showed that GFP was expressed from the <i>ecmA</i> promoter in the same localization in slugs and fruiting bodies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) as has been previously described for <i>ecmA</i>-LacZ (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jermyn and Williams, 1991</a>). As expected, in wild type controls, increasing DIF concentrations resulted in greater numbers of GFP expressing cells, with only a small change in GFP expression level per cell (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Most importantly, at all concentrations of DIF, the number of responding <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant cells was lower than wild type (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). However, there was little difference in the level of <i>ecmA</i>:GFP expression between individual wild type or <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant responding cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Taken together, these data provide strong support for the idea that <i>gefE</i> regulates the cell-intrinsic threshold at which cells respond to DIF."

                                "text": "We next sought to understand the molecular mechanism by which GefE affects lineage bias. As <i>gefE</i> is predicted to encode a RasGEF, whose primary function is to activate Ras proteins by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP, it therefore seemed likely that GefE would exert its effects on DIF dependent lineage bias through Ras regulation. Although the <i>Dictyostelium</i> genome encodes 11 Ras proteins, only one, RasD, exhibits strong developmental expression (<a href=\"#bib56\">Reymond et al., 1984</a>). Furthermore, we found that the level of both RasD expression and GTP bound activated RasD are significantly higher in cells grown in the absence of glucose (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Finally, GefE and RasD mutant cells have previously been shown to exhibit identical slug phototaxis defects (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wilkins et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib69\">2005</a>), raising the possibility that RasD could be a target for GefE. To test this idea directly, we firstly compared the relative levels of RasD-GTP in wild type and mutant cells by Western blot, using a pull down assay and a specific antibody (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wilkins et al., 2000</a>). In 12 hr developed cells, the level of activated RasD was significantly lower in <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant cells, although there was no difference in the total level of the RasD protein (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In addition, there was no corresponding decrease in the levels of activated RasG, RasB, RasC or Rap1 (data not shown). These results suggest that GefE is the predominant activator of RasD and is specific for RasD. We therefore next tested whether <i>rasD</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> and <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutants exhibit similar cell fate choice phenotypes. When labelled wild type cells were mixed with <i>rasD</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> mutant cells, the labelled cells accumulated in the pstO and pstB populations and were underrepresented in the prespore population (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, when RasD expression levels were elevated in wild type cells or cells were forced to express constitutively active <i>rasD</i>(G12T), these cells exhibited a strong localization towards the pstB region at the rear of slug and in the lower cup of fruiting bodies when mixed with wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Importantly, unlike wild type cells, this effect was only observed in <i>gefE</i><sup>\u2212</sup> mutant cells which expressed constitutively active <i>rasD</i>(G12T). These findings thus suggest that RasD is normally converted to its GTP bound form upon activation by GefE and support the idea that GefE and RasD coordinate DIF dependent lineage bias."

Firstly, we found that growth of cells in G\u2212 medium (conditions that increase the likelihood of DIF dependent lineage choice) resulted in a significant increase in the number of <i>rasD:RFP</i> expressing cells (73 \u00b1 3% to 89 \u00b1 5%) whereas no change was observed in <i>gefE:RFP</i> expressing cells. Secondly, growing <i>rasD:RFP</i> expressing cells were sorted by FACS based on their fluorescence and developed in chimera with wild type cells. Cells expressing lower levels of RasD were found to be less likely to differentiate as prestalk cells than prespore cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Surprisingly, however, cells expressing high <i>rasD</i> transcript levels can form both prespore and prestalk cells, as evidenced by their random distribution at both slug and culminant stages (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). So, while there is an increased likelihood that high RasD cells will become prestalk cells compared to low RasD cells, they do not sort to pstO and pstB regions as might be expected. One likely explanation for this discrepancy is that the stability of the RFP protein may be different to endogenous RasD. For example, if RasD protein has a shorter half-life than RFP, then cells expressing RFP may no longer express RasD. These cells would thus not exhibit the expected prestalk bias and could differentiate as prespore cells."

This often leads to the establishment of a dynamic equilibrium that allows populations to return to normal after perturbation or respond appropriately to environmental cues (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Eldar and Elowitz, 2010</a>). In order to test whether RasD behaves in this fashion, <i>rasD</i> high or <i>rasD</i> low expressing cells were purified by FACS and then regrown in culture. Each population quickly returned to its pre-sorted equilibrium (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). It is interesting to note, however, that the low RasD expressing population exhibits slightly faster dynamics than the high RasD expressing population, thus supporting the idea that chimeric behavior may be affected by differences in RasD transcription/translation and RFP stability. Together these findings suggest that population heterogeneity is generated by dynamic <i>rasD</i> expression in vegetative cells and that extrinsic factors such as nutritional history affect the position of this dynamic equilibrium."

Initial studies carried out in cell lines expressing constitutively activated Ras(G12T) suggested Ras signaling played a key role in prestalk cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jaffer, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jaffer et al., 2001</a>). When these cells were developed in chimera with wild type cells, they were shown to occupy the collar and back of slugs, consistent with our present findings using RasD(G12T) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). However, disruption of the gene encoding RasD, the major developmentally expressed Ras protein, was reported not to affect cell fate specification during clonal development (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wilkins et al., 2000</a>). This led to the suggestion that observations with constitutively activated Ras could be an artifact or that lack of RasD could be compensated by upregulation of other Ras genes (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wilkins et al., 2000</a>). We found that there was indeed compensatory upregulation of the highly related RasG protein during development in both <i>rasD</i><sup>\u2212</sup> and <i>gefE</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> mutant backgrounds (data not shown) but that this did not affect lineage bias in chimeras with wild type cells. This suggests that GefE-mediated activation of RasD is uniquely important to confer lineage bias in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. Such bias can be viewed as giving some cells either a head start or handicap in a \u2018race\u2019 to adopt fates. Only a limited number of \u2018winning\u2019 cells will differentiate before feedback mechanisms restrict other cells from adopting this fate, a process akin to lateral inhibition. Indeed, an analogous form of cell competition has been observed during <i>Drosophila</i> development when a clone of slow growing mutant cells is surrounded by wild type cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Levayer and Moreno, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Vincent et al., 2013</a>). In this case, slow growing mutant cells are often eliminated by the faster growing wild type cells, which overgrow and compensate for their absence (<a href=\"#bib60\">Simpson and Morata, 1981</a>). Like cell fate bias, cell competition is thus based on measurements of relative fitness between neighboring cells. Consequently, disruption of competition or bias genes only results in subtle defects during when all developing cells are the same genotype, such as a delay in the timing of cell fate determination."

However, we have less knowledge as to the possible importance of Ras regulation by transcriptional or post-translational control. Our studies using a reporter gene in which the <i>rasD</i> promoter drives RFP expression, reveals heterogeneous transcriptional activation of a <i>ras</i> gene within a population of growing <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells. Furthermore, this proportion increases when cells are transferred into medium lacking glucose. This indicates that there is a stochastic component to <i>rasD</i> gene expression that is influenced by external factors. In addition, when high or low <i>rasD</i> expressing cell populations are separated by FACS, they return to the pre-sorting equilibrium after a short period of growth. This suggests that cells freely transition between high and low <i>rasD</i> expressing subpopulations. Similar dynamic transcription has been observed in mammalian cell populations and is thought to represent slowly fluctuating transcriptomes that prime cell fate decisions both in the petri dish and during early embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Silva and Smith, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kalmar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Canham et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abranches et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, growing <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells expressing low levels of <i>rasD</i> transcripts are primed to become prespore cells during development, whilst RasD hyperactivation is sufficient to drive cells towards a prestalk cell fate. Surprisingly, however, we found that cells expressing high <i>rasD:RFP</i> transcript levels only exhibit a relatively weak prestalk preference. One interpretation of this finding is that if RasD protein has a shorter half life than RFP, then not all cells that express RFP would actually express RasD. Consequently, not all RFP expressing cells would exhibit a prestalk bias and may be free to differentiate as prespore cells, thus hindering experimental observation of their behavior. It is interesting to note, however, that similar observations of cell populations behaving more promiscuously in their lineage restriction than might be expected, have also been seen when fluorescent protein reporters are used in studies of the early mouse embryo and in embryonic stem cell cultures (<a href=\"#bib10\">Canham et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Grabarek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Morgani et al., 2013</a>). Most importantly, all these observations highlight the need for faithful real time reporters of gene expression, which will permit future studies of the regulation of RasD promoter activity, the molecular basis of transcriptional heterogeneity and lineage priming in general."

                                "text": "Immediate-early DIF responses have been shown to be digital, with the number of responding cells being strongly affected by changes in DIF concentration, whereas the magnitude of the response in individual cells is largely unaffected (<a href=\"#bib61\">Stevense et al., 2010</a>). This observation implies that (1) a response is only triggered once an internal threshold is exceeded and (2) the position of the threshold varies across a population. Work described in this report provides further support for this idea and gives mechanistic insight into how the DIF response threshold is set and, thus, how cell fate choice is regulated in vivo. Specifically, we find that GefE dependent heterogeneous RasD activation during the growth phase is required to set the normal DIF response threshold. However, several major questions emerge. For example, DIF is a developmental inducer that is present only after cells have been starved; yet the DIF response threshold is set (by RasD levels) before DIF exposure, in the growth phase. Indeed, heterogeneity in <i>rasD</i> expression is independent of DIF, as RasD expression is unaffected by DIF treatment (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jermyn et al., 1987</a> and data not shown). One clue to how this heterogeneity is generated comes from our observation that RasD protein levels are higher in cells grown in medium lacking glucose. This suggests that heterogeneity in metabolic state between cells may play a role in <i>rasD</i> regulation. However, other growth phase heterogeneities, including differences in cell cycle position (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gomer and Firtel, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Araki et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Thompson and Kay, 2000a</a>), intracellular calcium concentration (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baskar et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Azhar et al., 2001</a>) and intracellular pH (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gross et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kubohara et al., 2007</a>) have all also previously been shown to affect cell fate choice. However, the molecular basis underlying these heterogeneities, or whether they affect RasD expression, is currently unknown. It thus remains to be determined whether they are a cause or consequence of the observed differences in RasD levels. Furthermore, it is currently unknown how RasD activation affects the sensitivity of cells to DIF at the molecular level. Because <i>gefE</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> and <i>rasD</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> cells are capable of forming DIF dependent cell types during development and <i>rasD</i> transcription is not induced by DIF (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jermyn et al., 1987</a> and data not shown), these observations strongly suggest that RasD is not a central component of the DIF response pathway and that positive feedback through <i>rasD</i> transcriptional activation does not contribute to the binary switch. It thus appears that RasD only \u2018tunes\u2019 responses to DIF, rather than being integral to the DIF response per se. One clue to the molecular basis of this regulation, however, comes from the finding that the rapid (within 10 min) nuclear translocation of GATAc-GFP in response to DIF is affected in the <i>gefE</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> mutant. Consequently, it seems likely that the tuning effects of RasD act during the immediate-early phase of the DIF response. However, to fully understand how this tuning of DIF sensitivity occurs will require a greater knowledge of the DIF signaling pathway itself, and crucially how each component is regulated (as all components represent potential RasD targets). For example, to date, only a small number of transcription factors and one protein kinase have been shown to be crucial for DIF signal transduction and responses (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fukuzawa et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Thompson et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhukovskaya et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Huang et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Keller and Thompson, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Araki et al., 2012</a>). However, the regulation of their activity is complex, requiring control by posttranslational modifications, as well as subcellular localization (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fukuzawa et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Thompson et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhukovskaya et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Huang et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Araki et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Keller and Thompson, 2008</a>). It is therefore possible that RasD alters the activity of specific protein kinases or transcription factors or hitherto unknown DIF signaling components, making them more likely to be DIF induced. In this way, because the DIF signaling pathway is intact in <i>rasD</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> and <i>gefE</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> mutant cells, they would still respond to DIF (albeit less efficiently than wild type) when given prolonged exposure to the signal. Finally, it is unclear to what extent inputs from different signaling pathways are also integrated to modulate the sensitivity of cells to DIF in response to nutritional bias, or other modulators of cell fate bias. Indeed, it is likely that the effects of nutrition are only partially explained by GefE activity. For example, when <i>gefE</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> mutant cells are grown in the absence of glucose are compared to wild type cells grown in the presence of glucose, they do not produce as many spores in chimeric development. Furthermore, the <i>Dictyostelium</i> retinoblastoma ortholog, RblA, is a cell cycle regulated protein whose expression level during the growth phase is correlated with both DIF sensitivity and cell fate preference during development (<a href=\"#bib49\">MacWilliams et al., 2006</a>). Interestingly, <i>rblA</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> mutant cells display hypersensitivity to DIF and adopt collar and back cell fates when mixed with wild type cells in chimera, perhaps indicating a degree of antagonism between Ras and Retinoblastoma signaling. Similarly, knock out of the Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 homolog, <i>gskA</i>, results in DIF hypersensitivity and the <i>gskA</i><sup>\u2212</sup> strain preferentially forms basal disc cells at the expense of spores when developed clonally (<a href=\"#bib28\">Harwood et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schilde et al., 2004</a>). Such similarities, as well as clear phenotypic differences (data not shown), suggest this level of complexity allows the DIF signal to be integrated into multiple fate choices during development."

However, remarkable similarities are emerging between this evolutionarily ancient organism and the behavior of embryonic stem cell cultures, and indeed lineage specification in the early mouse embryo. (1) Salt and pepper differentiation of prestalk and prespore cells: During mouse embryogenesis, the PrE and EPI lineages arise from the ICM. Each lineage can be clearly defined at later stages through specific gene expression profiles, as well as their position within the blastocyst. However, at the earliest stages cells expressing PrE and EPI lineage markers are intermingled, with active sorting out observed at later stages (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dietrich and Hiiragi, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Plusa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yamanaka et al., 2010</a>). (2) Dynamic expression of lineage priming/specific gene expression: observations in cell culture reveal expression of ICM cell fate markers such as Hex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Canham et al., 2010</a>) and Nanog (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chambers et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kalmar et al., 2009b</a>) is highly heterogeneous. When high or low level expressing cells are separated by FACS, the population structure returns to an equilibrium on time-scale of hours to days. Most importantly, differences in expression levels also correlate well with fate preferences in chimeric development (<a href=\"#bib10\">Canham et al., 2010</a>). (3) Modulation of Ras activation affects lineage choice: although FGF activates multiple pathways, genetic studies indicate that the Grb2 &gt; Sos (RasGEF) &gt; Ras &gt; Erk axis is the most important during differentiation of both ES cells and PrE (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chazaud et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lanner and Rossant, 2010</a>). (4) Heterogeneous responses/thresholds to differentiation signals: FGF signaling is required for normal EPI/PrE differentiation (<a href=\"#bib72\">Yamanaka et al., 2010</a>). However, it has recently been shown that salt and pepper expression pattern of EPI and PrE markers does not require FGF signaling (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kang et al., 2013</a>). Rather, activation of this pathway is associated with exit from pluripotent state and commitment to the PrE fate. Finally when FGF levels are manipulated, the proportion of PrE:EPI cells correlates well with FGF levels, implying existence of cell intrinsic threshold to FGF (<a href=\"#bib72\">Yamanaka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Grabarek et al., 2012</a>)."

Population level variation in sensitivity to a global signal is one way to generate diversity. However, our understanding of the mechanistic basis of lineage priming is still in its infancy. One reason for this is that mutants in lineage priming genes may only show subtle defects during clonal development. Importantly, our study highlights that testing chimeric effects can uncover important regulatory roles for these genes. Due to the relative ease with which chimeric development can be assayed in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, it seems likely that studies in this model system will lead to a better understanding of how lineage biases are acquired and potentially how they might be manipulated to increase the efficiency of stem cell based therapeutics."

The aggregating slime mold system provides an interesting model to explore this mechanism, which has relevance in many other developmental systems. Previous work established that differentiation towards stalk or spore cells could be biased by the past history of the cells \u2013 cell cycle position or growth with or without glucose \u2013 and that this bias was manifest as altered sensitivity to the morphogen DIF. However, there were no clues as to the molecular basis of the bias. Your use of a novel genetic screen to identify GefE (a RasGEF) as a key downstream component in the pathway has opened up new insights into to the role of Ras activation levels in establishing cell heterogeneity and lineage specification.

Although it is impossible to accurately quantify the complexity of a REMI library (e.g., due to hot spots, etc.), we have performed several different experiments to resolve this issue as suggested. Firstly, we had already carried out a parallel selection on the same REMI library. Both selections resulted in an enrichment of mutants that can avoid the pstO and pstB cell bias imposed by glucose. We now include qualitative data showing this. Several mutants were isolated in both selections, however we were only able to confirm the gefE mutant through recapitulation experiments (i.e., the other mutants were caused by secondary mutations in addition to the identified REMI insertion). Most importantly, the <i>gefE</i> mutant was detected in both libraries, but at round 2 and round 6. We believe that these differences are likely due to the effects of random genetic drift caused by harvesting a finite number of spores after each round. Alternatively, it has recently been shown that when multiple clones are hatched and grown on bacteria, small differences in growth rate at the feeding edge can be amplified, leading to overrepresentation of some clones (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buttery et al, 2012</a>). We have modified the text in the Results to include this."

These reconstruction experiments revealed no difference in the rate of growth of <i>gefE</i>- mutant cells in either G+ or G- medium. However, <i>gefE</i><sup>-</sup> mutant spores did hatch at a faster rate than wild type spores, perhaps also helping to explain the unexpectedly strong enrichment for this mutant within the pools.

The observation that cells expressing high <i>rasD</i> transcript levels can form both prespore and prestalk cells, as evidenced by their random distribution at both slug and culminant stages is thus surprising. We believe that these results are still consistent with the idea that there is an increased likelihood that high RasD cells will become prestalk cells compared to low RasD cells. One likely explanation for their failure to solely become prestalk cells is that the stability of the RFP protein may be different to endogenous RasD. For example, if RasD protein has a shorter half life than RFP, then not all cells that express RFP would actually express RasD. Consequently, not all RFP expressing cells would exhibit a prestalk bias and may be free to differentiate as prespore cells, thus hindering experimental observation of their behavior. One observation supporting this idea is that the low RasD expressing population exhibits slightly faster dynamics than the high RasD expressing population, thus supporting the idea that chimeric behavior may be affected by differences in RasD transcription/translation and RFP stability. We have now included expanded description and discussion of these ideas to clarify these issues within the Results and Discussion."

However, several major questions emerge. For example, DIF is a developmental inducer that is present only after cells have been starved; yet the DIF response threshold is set (by RasD levels) before DIF exposure, in the growth phase. Indeed, heterogeneity in <i>rasD</i> expression is independent of DIF, as RasD expression is unaffected by DIF treatment ((<a href=\"#bib33\">Jermyn et al., 1987</a>) and data not shown). One clue to how this heterogeneity is generated comes from our observation that RasD protein levels are higher in cells grown in medium lacking glucose. This suggests that heterogeneity in metabolic state between cells may play a role in <i>rasD</i> regulation. However, other growth phase heterogeneities, including differences in cell cycle position (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gomer and Firtel, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Araki et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Thompson and Kay, 2000a</a>), intracellular calcium concentration (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baskar et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Azhar et al., 2001</a>) and intracellular pH (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gross et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kubohara et al., 2007</a>) have all also previously been shown to affect cell fate choice. In addition, the molecular basis underlying these heterogeneities, or whether they affect RasD expression, is currently unknown.
