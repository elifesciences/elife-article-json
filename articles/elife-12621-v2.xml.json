Reversible inactivating covalent modification of BiP is believed to contribute to the balance between chaperones and unfolded ER proteins, but the nature of this modification has so far been hinted at indirectly. We report that deletion of <i>FICD</i>, a gene encoding an ER-localized AMPylating enzyme, abolished detectable modification of endogenous BiP enhancing ER buffering of unfolded protein stress in mammalian cells, whilst deregulated FICD activity had the opposite effect. In vitro, FICD AMPylated BiP to completion on a single residue, Thr<sup>518</sup>. AMPylation increased, in a strictly <i>FICD</i>-dependent manner, as the flux of proteins entering the ER was attenuated in vivo. In vitro, Thr<sup>518</sup> AMPylation enhanced peptide dissociation from BiP 6-fold and abolished stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by J-domain cofactor. These findings expose the molecular basis for covalent inactivation of BiP."

Reversible inactivating covalent modification of BiP is believed to contribute to the balance between chaperones and unfolded ER proteins, but the nature of this modification has so far been hinted at indirectly. We report that deletion of <i>FICD</i>, a gene encoding an ER-localized AMPylating enzyme, abolished detectable modification of endogenous BiP enhancing ER buffering of unfolded protein stress in mammalian cells, whilst deregulated FICD activity had the opposite effect. In vitro, FICD AMPylated BiP to completion on a single residue, Thr<sup>518</sup>. AMPylation increased, in a strictly <i>FICD</i>-dependent manner, as the flux of proteins entering the ER was attenuated in vivo. In vitro, Thr<sup>518</sup> AMPylation enhanced peptide dissociation from BiP 6-fold and abolished stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by J-domain cofactor. These findings expose the molecular basis for covalent inactivation of BiP."

Further studies showed that AMP attaches to a single amino acid of BiP, number 518, a threonine. Reconstructing the AMPylation of threonine 518 in a test tube caused the modified BiP to lose its ability to engage with unfolded proteins."

Further studies are now needed to determine how AMPylation inactivates BiP and to understand how the FICD enzyme is regulated so that it performs AMPylation at the right time.

On a much shorter time scale BiP\u2019s oligomeric state is observed to change, with fewer oligomers present as levels of unfolded protein increase. The architecture of BiP oligomers is consistent with their role as a rapidly accessible repository of inactive BiP that the cell may draw upon in short notice to cope with rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load (<a href=\"#bib37\">Preissler et al., 2015</a>). BiP is also subject to activity-dependent post-translational modification(s). This is reflected in transfer of metabolic label from intracellular pools of tritiated adenosine and <sup>32</sup>P phosphate onto BiP, covalently modifying the protein (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carlsson and Lazarides, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hendershot et al., 1988</a>) and imparting upon it a lower isoelectric point (pI) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carlsson and Lazarides, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Laitusis et al., 1999</a>). These covalent transformation(s) of BiP correlate inversely with the burden of unfolded proteins in the ER (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chambers et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Laitusis et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Leno and Ledford, 1989</a>) and because the modified form of BiP was under-represented in complex with substrates (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hendershot et al., 1988</a>), were deemed to reflect inactivating modification(s) of the chaperone (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chambers et al., 2012</a>)."

Early work even suggested the presence of an enzymatic activity in cell lysates that could transfer a label from <sup>32</sup>P NAD<sup>+</sup> onto BiP in vitro (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carlsson and Lazarides, 1983</a>); but molecular characterization of this enzymatic activity proved elusive. A consensus emerged in regards to\u00a0the region of BiP that bears the modification, as both <sup>32</sup>P orthophosphate and <sup>3</sup>H adenosine labeling mapped consistently to a cyanogen bromide (CnBr) cleavage fragment in the C-terminal substrate binding domain of BiP (Thr<sup>434</sup> to Met<sup>541</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chambers et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gaut, 1997</a>). Mutations in two arginine residues on that fragment (Arg<sup>470</sup> and Arg<sup>492</sup>) markedly attenuated radiolabeling in vivo of FLAG-tagged BiP expressed in cells, suggesting that they might be the modification sites (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chambers et al., 2012</a>), but peptides with a mass consistent with ADP-ribosylated BiP were never uncovered and the assignments thus remained tentative."

This modification of BiP is effected by a broadly conserved, ER-localized enzyme, FICD (also known as HYPE) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ham et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sanyal et al., 2015</a>). There is lack of unanimity in regards to the circumstances and consequences of BiP AMPylation: the Orth lab provides evidence that AMPylation is an inactivation modification, induced when client protein burden is low (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ham et al., 2014</a>), whereas the Mattoo lab suggests that it is an activating modification induced by ER stress (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sanyal et al., 2015</a>). AMPylation can explain both the metabolic labeling profile of BiP (from adenosine and phosphate pools) as well as the acidity of the modified form and possibly even the sensitivity to novobiocin (an ATP mimetic). However, the assignment of AMPylation to Ser<sup>365</sup> or Thr<sup>366</sup> in the nucleotide binding domain of BiP (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ham et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sanyal et al., 2015</a>) is at odds with the cyanogen bromide cleavage pattern of metabolically labeled BiP, suggesting a complex scenario of multiple modifications with alternative outcomes."

BiP consists of an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD, pink) and a C-terminal substrate binding domain (SBD, blue) connected by a hydrophobic interdomain linker peptide (green). The SBD is composed of a two-layered \u03b2-sandwich subdomain (SBD\u03b2) containing the substrate binding crevice and a helical lid structure (SBD\u03b1). In the ATP-bound conformation the NBD and SBD form extensive contacts, which involves the linker region, and the SBD is in the open conformation (SBD\u03b1 extended) allowing for interactions with substrates (dark blue) at high association and dissociation rates. Upon ATP hydrolysis to ADP the inter-subunit contacts are lost leading to exposure of the linker, packing of SBD\u03b1 against SBD\u03b2, and strong reduction of substrate interaction kinetics. Cleavage of BiP by the linker-specific protease SubA (scissors) is favored in the ADP-bound state. (<b>B</b>) Immunoblot of endogenous BiP resolved by native gel electrophoresis. Where indicated the CHO-K1 cells were exposed to cycloheximide (CHX; 100 \u00b5g/mL) or thapsigargin (Tg; 0.5 \u00b5M) for the indicated time. The major species visible on the native gel are numbered by order of descending mobility (I-III) and the monomeric \u2018B\u2019 form induced by CHX treatment and the \u2018A\u2019 form detectable in untreated cells are marked. Immunoblots of the same samples resolved by SDS-PAGE report on total BiP and total eIF2\u03b1 (which also serves as a loading control) and phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 to reveal the impact of thapsigargin action.

The difference between the predicted mass of a molecule of AMP bound via an ester linkage (329.12 Da) and the observed mass difference between the modified and unmodified BiP (335 Da) is reflective of the broad peaks associated with these measurements. These observations indicate a single quantitative modification of BiP by AMPylation and also fit the simple pattern of modified BiP migration on the IEF-PAGE\u00a0gel. An analogous mass spectrometry experiment with endogenous BiP immunopurified from cycloheximide-treated wildtype CHO-K1 cells also revealed only two molecular masses (70,538.3 Da and 70,866.1 Da) with a mass difference of 327.8 Da, consistent with modification of BiP by a single AMP moiety in vivo.

The V461F mutation may enhance access of FICD to BiP simply by reducing competing oligomerization interactions amongst BiP proteins.

Strong feedback control operative in the UPR specifies that such attenuation, were it to occur, would be transient and so more likely to be detected by monitoring early events in the UPR, such as PERK and IRE1\u03b1 autophosphorylation, than later events, such as reporter gene activity.

Attempts to pinpoint these hypothesized modifications directly were unsuccessful. The discovery of FICD-mediated BiP AMPylation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ham et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sanyal et al., 2015</a>) was thus an important breakthrough whose significance is enhanced further by our finding that elimination of FICD abolishes all evidence for endogenous BiP modification in vivo as detected by IEF- and native-PAGE, and changes in mass of the endogenous protein. These findings unify and clarify the pre-existing observations regarding BiP modification and indicate that FICD-mediated AMPylation on Thr<sup>518</sup> is the major, if not the only covalent change in this chaperone detectable by the existing methods. Furthermore, FICD-mediated AMPylation on Thr<sup>518</sup> is sufficient to account for the previously observed key features of modified BiP, namely its acidity and inertness."

Provided ATP as a co-substrate, FICD modifies BiP in vitro at a single site with a mass expected of AMPylation. AMPylation maps solely to peptides encompassing Thr<sup>518</sup> and these are modified to high stoichiometry in vitro. Furthermore, an unbiased chemical proteomic approach to profiling proteins that are modified by FICD in a cell lysate in vitro led to the identification of BiP Thr<sup>518</sup> as an AMPylation site, whereas no modification at Ser<sup>365</sup> or Thr<sup>366</sup> was reported (<a href=\"#bib4\">Broncel et al., 2015</a>). It is thus tempting to speculate that AMPylation\u00a0on\u00a0Thr<sup>518</sup> is the only quantitatively significant modification of BiP carried out by FICD in vivo too. However, the discovery that an FIC-domain containing bacterial enzyme AMPylates eukaryotic targets (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kinch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yarbrough et al., 2009</a>) was closely followed by the realization that the domain may also participate in transfer of part of other pyrophosphate-containing metabolites, leading to UMPylation, mono-phosphorylation and conjugation of phosphocholine (reviewed in\u00a0<a href=\"#bib15\">Garcia-Pino et al., 2014</a>). Thus, one must keep an open mind in regards to the possibility of parallel FICD-mediated modification of BiP (and possibly other ER proteins) by metabolites (other than ATP) found in the ER."

However, both interactions are disrupted in the substrate binding domain of human BiP in the ATP state (PDB 5E84).

Therefore, mobilization of the side chain by allosteric signals attendant upon ATP binding is suggested to enhance exposure of Thr<sup>518</sup> to solvent explaining the selective FICD-mediated modification of ATP-bound BiP and the absence of modification of mutant variants of BiP that are defective in domain coupling (BiP<sup>ADDA</sup>, BiP<sup>G226D</sup> and to a lesser extent BiP<sup>T37G</sup>). These recent observations on human BiP (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 2015</a>) also showcase the long range allostery common to all Hsp70 proteins (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mayer, 2013</a>): the identity of the nucleotide bound in the nucleotide binding domain affects stability of L<sub>7,8</sub> on the opposite side of the protein.

The current findings indicate that our earlier conclusions were in error and suggest that the important structural role of R470 [in all Hsp70s (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fernandez-Saiz et al., 2006</a>)] and R492 [specifically in BiP (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 2015</a>)] may have given rise to defective allosteric transitions by the R470 and R492 BiP mutants.

Our observations suggest that this new state would resemble the ATP-bound state in terms of high substrate \u201coff\u201d rates, but would differ from it in terms of (un)responsiveness to J protein-driven ATP hydrolysis. It is notable in this regard that the ATP-like conformation can be uncoupled from responsiveness to J protein, as a mutation of BiP\u2019s substrate binding domain (G461P/G468P) that locks the protein in an ATP-like conformation is also refractory to J protein-mediated stimulation of ATP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 2015</a>)."

All this suggests a simple mechanism whereby substrate-free, ATP-associated BiP partitions between two mutually exclusive fates: entering the substrate binding cycle or AMPylation. The former is driven by the concentration of unfolded client proteins and catalyzed by J proteins, whereas the latter imposes on BiP an inactive conformation that disfavors the J protein-mediated ATP hydrolysis required for high affinity client binding (<a href=\"#bib10\">De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Misselwitz et al., 1998</a>). High client \u201coff\u201d rates ensure that AMPylated BiP would neither interfere with protein folding by interacting excessively with substrates, nor would it unduly repress the UPR transducers. And futile cycles of ATP hydrolysis would be obviated by refractoriness to stimulation by J protein.

Like other type II or III FIC domain-containing proteins, FICD is intrinsically repressed by the insertion of a conserved glutamate into the ATP binding pocket, delocalizing the co-substrate ATP (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bunney et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Engel et al., 2012</a>). Relief of such repression, imposed experimentally by the E234G mutation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Engel et al., 2012</a>) or by a nanobody (<a href=\"#bib44\">Truttmann et al., 2015</a>), is likely attained physiologically through allosteric mechanisms. Evidence that FICD binds unfolded proteins directly (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sanyal et al., 2015</a>) hint at the possibility that such allostery might be responsive to the burden of unfolded proteins in the ER or might be regulated by FICD\u2019s oligomeric state or co-factor binding (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bunney et al., 2014</a>). Coupling of FICD\u2019s intrinsic activity to protein folding homeostasis in the ER could conserve energy by limiting the futile cycles of AMPylation and de-AMPylation prescribed by regulation based solely on kinetic competition with substrates for BiP in the ATP-bound state. Furthermore, regulation of FICD enzymatic activity would explain the dissociation between transcriptional induction of the <i>FICD</i> gene during the UPR and the emergence of modified BiP, which, as shown here, is delayed until after resolution of the stress."

The architecture of the oligomers, whereby one BiP molecule engages the interdomain linker of another as a conventional substrate peptide (<a href=\"#bib37\">Preissler et al., 2015</a>), implies that BiP protomers are locked in the ADP-bound state and unlikely to serve as a substrate for AMPylation. This conjecture fits the observation that depletion of ER calcium, which promotes BiP oligomerization at the expense of substrate binding, is associated with gradual depletion of the FICD-dependent modified \u2018B\u2019 form of BiP (<a href=\"#bib37\">Preissler et al., 2015</a>)."

But the emergence of active mechanisms to downregulate BiP activity suggest that an excess of functional BiP might have a cost too. This cost is less obvious than that associated with UPR defects, as FICD inactivation results in no conspicuous growth defect in cultured cells. Nonetheless, our findings indicate that in circumstances of limited client protein load, the absence of FICD shifts the equilibrium in the ER in favor\u00a0of chaperones over their clients (at least as reflected in attenuated UPR signaling). BiP overexpression works in the same direction and is known to impose a measure of inefficiency in the secretion of certain proteins (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dorner et al., 1992</a>), it will thus be interesting to learn if FICD inactivation also promotes inefficiency in secretion and if so, under what circumstances."

BiP was known to undergo a modification in the ER, which was believed to be ADP-ribosylation based upon incorporation of phosphate and adenosine. Previously, the Ron lab indirectly mapped the sites of ADP-ribosylation to two arginines in the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of BiP. Two recent papers established that the modification is AMPylation, not ADP-ribosylation, and identified an ER localized enzyme (FICD/HYPE) that is likely responsible for the modification. However, contradictory conclusions were reached concerning the location of the AMPylated residue (ATPase domain or SBD) and the impact of AMPylation on BiP activity and UPR signaling. In the current manuscript, Preissler et al. use a combination of in vitro AMPylation experiments and cell culture experiments to convincingly demonstrate the following: (a) FICD modifies a single site in the substrate binding domain of BiP both in vitro and in cells, (b) the primary modification site is T518, (c) AMPylation of BiP reduces BiPs ATPase rate and renders it less-responsive to J domain containing proteins, (d) excessive AMPylation of BiP is toxic to cells due to constitutive activation of the UPR and (e) a block in AMPylation of BiP blunts the early response of cells to ER stress. One weakness of the paper is that the effects of constitutive AMPylation or inhibited AMPylation on UPR signaling are relatively small. It thus remains unclear whether the modification has an important physiological role. The subtle change in the kinetics of UPR activation that was observed in the FIDC null cells is probably not sufficient to warrant the title of the manuscript. This is a solid and interesting paper that should be appropriate for publication in <i>eLife</i> after modifications to address the major points listed below."

Its dependence on the ability of BiP to engage substrate in its SDB indicates that the interactions reflect the ability of the J protein to stimulate ATP hydrolysis driving BiP hyper affinity for substrates whilst serve as an unfolded substrate at the same time (see Figure Supplement 6 in Petrova et al. 2008; PMID: 18923430).
