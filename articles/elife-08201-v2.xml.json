While the Hippo signaling pathway plays a major role in organ growth control, how it senses and responds to increased cell density is still unclear. In this study, we use the zebrafish lateral line primordium (LLP), a group of migrating epithelial cells that form sensory organs, to understand how tissue growth is controlled during organ formation. Loss of the cell junction-associated Motin protein Amotl2a leads to overproliferation and bigger LLP, affecting the final pattern of sensory organs. Amotl2a function in the LLP is mediated together by the Hippo pathway effector Yap1 and the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin effector Lef1. Our results implicate for the first time the Hippo pathway in size regulation in the LL system. We further provide evidence that the Hippo/Motin interaction is essential to limit tissue size during development."

While the Hippo signaling pathway plays a major role in organ growth control, how it senses and responds to increased cell density is still unclear. In this study, we use the zebrafish lateral line primordium (LLP), a group of migrating epithelial cells that form sensory organs, to understand how tissue growth is controlled during organ formation. Loss of the cell junction-associated Motin protein Amotl2a leads to overproliferation and bigger LLP, affecting the final pattern of sensory organs. Amotl2a function in the LLP is mediated together by the Hippo pathway effector Yap1 and the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin effector Lef1. Our results implicate for the first time the Hippo pathway in size regulation in the LL system. We further provide evidence that the Hippo/Motin interaction is essential to limit tissue size during development."

At regular intervals, the cluster deposits small bunches of cells from its trailing end. The resulting loss of cells from the cluster is balanced by cell division at the front of the cluster, which is triggered by another signaling pathway called Wnt signaling. A protein of the \u2018Motin\u2019 family called Amotl2a is present in this migrating cluster. Motin proteins form junctions between cells and inhibit the activity of Yap1, but it is not known whether they are involved in regulating the size of organs."

The experiments show that when Amotl2a is absent, the migrating cell cluster becomes larger, with the highest levels of cell division occurring at its trailing end. Yap1 and a protein involved in Wnt signaling called Lef1 are also present in the cluster and are required for it to be normal in size. In zebrafish that lack Amotl2a, the additional loss of Yap1 prevents this cluster from becoming too large. From these and other results, it appears that Amotl2a regulates the size of the lateral line cell cluster by restricting the ability of Yap1 and Lef1 to promote cell division."

First identified in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Pan, 2007</a>), the Hippo signaling pathway is highly conserved in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib32\">Halder and Johnson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Pan, 2010</a>). When Hippo signaling is active, the Hippo pathway effectors YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1) and TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with a PDZ domain), the vertebrate homologs of the <i>Drosophila</i> Yorkie, are phosphorylated by a cascade of kinases leading to their sequestration in the cytoplasm and/or their degradation. In contrast, when the Hippo signaling pathway is inactive, YAP/TAZ can translocate into the nucleus and mediate transcription of genes that promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib89\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Barry and Camargo, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Yu and Guan, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bossuyt et al., 2014</a>)."

AMOT, AMOTL1, and AMOTL2 are scaffold proteins associated with tight-junctions, required for tight junction integrity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bratt et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Sugihara-Mizuno et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Zheng et al., 2009</a>) and endothelial cell migration (<a href=\"#bib74\">Troyanovsky et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bratt et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aase et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Hultin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Moleirinho et al., 2014</a>). Recently, Motin proteins have further been shown to interact with YAP and TAZ via their PPxY motifs and the WW motifs of YAP and TAZ (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hirate et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hong, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lucci et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Yi et al., 2013</a>). In most cases, this physical interaction leads to the inhibition of YAP/TAZ via cytoplasmic retention, similar to, but independent of the canonical Hippo pathway. Interestingly, there is a competition between YAP/TAZ and F-actin to bind to Motin proteins (<a href=\"#bib53\">Mana-Capelli et al., 2014</a>). Motin proteins have thus been proposed to mediate the response of YAP/TAZ to changes in the actin cytoskeleton downstream of mechanical signals. Yet, whether Motin proteins play such a central role in regulating organ growth in vivo in developing organisms is still largely unknown."

The pLL is a sensory system comprised of mechanosensory organs, the neuromasts, scattered on the surface of the body. The pLL primordium (pLLP) consists of about 100 progenitors that delaminate from a cranial placode and migrate posteriorly towards the tip of the tail (<a href=\"#bib56\">Metcalfe et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudiere, 2004</a>). As the pLLP migrates, small groups of cells within its trailing region undergo cell shape changes to assemble into rosette-like structures, called proneuromasts. This assembly requires Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling and the downstream effectors Shroom3 and Rock2a to activate non-muscle myosin and apical-constriction (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lecaudey et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ernst et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Harding and Nechiporuk, 2012</a>). Once assembled, proneuromasts are deposited behind the migrating pLLP and differentiate into functional neuromasts."

We focus on the role of the Motin protein Angiomotin-like 2a (Amotl2a) that has been reported to be expressed in the migrating pLLP, to be a target of FGF signaling (<a href=\"#bib40\">Huang et al., 2007</a>), to inhibit Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling during early zebrafish development (<a href=\"#bib50\">Li et al., 2012</a>), and is a potential candidate to interact with the Hippo signaling pathway. Loss of Amotl2a function results in a significant increase in pLLP size due to overproliferation. In a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen, we identified the zebrafish Hippo pathway effectors Yap1 and Taz as strong interacting partners of Amotl2a. We show that Yap1 is required for the pLLP to reach its correct size and that reducing the level of Yap1 suppresses the overproliferation in <i>amotl2a</i> mutant pLLP. Finally we show that, in addition to Yap1, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway effector Lef1 also mediates the hyperplasia phenotype of <i>amotl2a</i> mutants. This leads us to propose that Amotl2a, possibly by forming a ternary complex with Yap1 and \u03b2-catenin, limits proliferation in the trailing part of the pLLP. Here, we report the first mechanism that limits proliferation in the pLLP. In addition, we implicate the Hippo effector Yap1 in size control in the pLLP for the first time. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that Motin proteins play a major role in limiting organ growth during development by negatively regulating Yap/Taz and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activities in vivo."

To determine whether this was due to an increase in cell number, we developed an algorithm to automatically count cells in the pLLP based on the membrane labeling in <i>cldnb:gfp</i> embryos (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Cell counts were done in pLLP that had reached the middle of the yolk extension in both controls and <i>amotl2a</i> morphants (thereafter referred to as \u2018mid-migration\u2019, red arrowhead in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, see also \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Cell counts indicated that the number of cells in <i>amotl2a</i> morphant pLLP was increased by 35\u201338% as compared to either uninjected or p53Mo-injected embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, p = 1.58E-40 and p = 9.53E-31, respectively). To confirm the specificity of the morphant phenotype, we co-injected Amotl2aMo with <i>amotl2a</i><sup><i>m</i></sup>, an RNA that was insensitive to the morpholino. Co-injection of Amotl2aMo with <i>amotl2a</i><sup><i>m</i></sup> RNA partially rescued the morphant phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>). While overexpression of <i>amotl2a</i> at the concentration used for the rescue experiment did not significantly reduce the number of cells in the pLLP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), injection at a higher concentration induced a moderate, but significant decrease in cell number (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, \u221215%, p = 5.20E-07).

There was a significant increase in the EdU index of about 15% in the pLLP of <i>amotl2a</i> morphants as compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>, p &lt; 0.05). Since <i>amotl2a</i> was not expressed in the most leading part of the pLLP, we determined the proliferation rates separately in the leading vs trailing region of the primordium. While there was no difference in the proliferation index in the leading region between morphants and controls, there was a 34% increase in the trailing region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>, p &lt; 0.0001). Altogether, these results indicated that Amotl2a is required to restrict the number of cells in the pLLP by limiting proliferation in the region where rosettes assemble."

Furthermore, mutations of the WW motifs of Yap1 and Taz abolished the corresponding interaction with Amotl2a (pink in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

                                "text": "To test whether an upregulation of Yap1/Taz activity could account for the increased cell number in the pLLP upon loss of Amotl2a function, we first assessed the expression of zebrafish <i>yap1</i> and <i>taz</i>. Both genes were broadly expressed during development including in the pLLP (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). We then asked whether Yap1 or Taz was implicated in controlling pLLP cell number using morpholino-based knockdown. Injection of a previously published translation-blocking Mo against Taz (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hong et al., 2005</a>) did not cause obvious differences in pLLP size (data not shown). In contrast, embryos injected with a previously published, splice-blocking Yap1 morpholino (Yap1Mo) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Skouloudaki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fukui et al., 2014</a>) were morphologically normal but had smaller pLLP than controls and often a rounder shape (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Cell counts indicated that the pLLP of <i>yap1</i> morphant embryos had about 15% less cells than uninjected controls (p = 2.65E-12) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Yet, they completed migration and deposited neuromasts. In order to confirm this essential role of Yap1 in controlling cell number in the pLLP, we generated <i>yap1</i> mutants using TALEN-mediated mutagenesis. Like for <i>amotl2a</i>, we further analyzed two <i>yap1</i> alleles with a frame shift leading to a premature STOP codon in the second exon (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). The putative resulting truncated proteins would lack most of their functional domains including the Transcriptional Enhancer Activator Domain (TEAD) binding domain, the 2 WW motifs and the PDZ-binding domains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Both alleles had identical phenotypes. <i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> homozygous mutants embryos were morphologically normal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>) with smaller and at times rounder pLLP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J,K</a>), a phenotype identical to that of the <i>yap1</i> morphants. Cell counts confirmed that <i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> pLLP also showed a decrease in cell number of 19% (p = 1.25E-05) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Interestingly, these embryos again developed into normal looking and fertile adult fish. MZ<i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants also developed normally and were morphologically indistinguishable from controls. To determine at which stage Yap1 activity was required in the pLLP, we performed cell counts in MZ<i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants when the pLLP starts to migrate (24 hpf), when it reaches the middle of the yolk extension (30 hpf) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L,M</a>), and at the end of the yolk extension (36 hpf). At 24 hpf, the pLLP of MZ<i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants was already 15% smaller than related controls (p = 4.12E-08). This difference continued to increase with time to reach 21% at 30 hpf (p = 2.15E-10) and 27% at 36 hpf (p = 2.41E-14) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5N\u2013P</a>). These results showed that Yap1 is required both before and during migration to establish the correct number of cells in the pLLP."

Given the reduced number of cells in the pLLP of <i>yap1</i> morphants and mutants, we expected a similar result. Intriguingly, neither our morphants (not shown) nor our MZ<i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants showed a decreased number of neuromasts (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Furthermore, these neuromasts did not contain fewer cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). These results strongly suggested that compensatory mechanisms kick-in in the pLLP of <i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants to allow them to migrate to the tip of the tail while depositing a normal number of neuromasts consisting of a normal number of cells despite their smaller size. It was also reported that neuromasts of <i>yap1</i> morphants contain fewer hair cells due to loss of <i>prox1</i> expression in these embryos (<a href=\"#bib50\">Li et al., 2012</a>). Intriguingly, neither the number of hair cells per neuromast (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013H</a>) nor the expression of <i>prox1</i> in the pLLP (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1I\u2013L\u2032</a>) was affected in our MZ<i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants. These discrepancies are discussed below. Altogether, our results indicated that Yap1 activity is required for the pLLP to reach its normal cell number and size. This further supported the idea that the increase in proliferation upon loss of Amotl2a activity could be due to an increase of Yap1 activity."

Automated cell counts revealed that the number of cells in the pLLP of <i>amotl2a;yap1</i> double morphants was significantly reduced as compared to <i>amotl2a</i> morphants (34% reduction, p = 1.53E-16) and was not significantly different from controls (p = 0.098) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

These mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from related controls.

This suggested that an increase in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin/Lef1 activity in the trailing region of the pLLP could also partially mediate the increase in cell number<i>.</i> We thus tested if suppressing Lef1 activity in <i>amotl2a</i> mutants would suppress this phenotype. For this purpose, we injected MZ<i>amotl2a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutant embryos with a previously published <i>lef1</i> morpholino (Lef1Mo) and performed cell counts at mid-migration (<a href=\"#bib76\">Valdivia et al., 2011</a>). While MZ<i>amotl2a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants showed bigger primordia as expected (36%, p = 2.89E-09) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>, see \u2018a\u2019 in N), <i>lef1</i> morphants at this stage did not show a significant reduction in pLLP cell counts (p = 0.1) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,J</a> and \u2018b\u2019 in N). In contrast, cell counts in Lef1Mo-injected MZ<i>amotl2a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants were significantly reduced as compared to MZ<i>amotl2a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants (\u221223%, p = 5.32E-08, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7N</a> \u2018c\u2019) and equivalent to controls (p = 0.28, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7N</a> \u2018d\u2019). Yet, they were still slightly higher than <i>lef1</i> morphants (15%, p = 0.01) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,K</a> and \u2018e\u2019 in N). These results suggested that the increased cell number in <i>amotl2a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants was Lef1-dependent. To confirm this, we tested if the difference in cell number in MZ<i>amotl2a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>;</i>MZ<i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> and MZ<i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>(see above) was due to Lef1 activity. Indeed when we injected MZ<i>amotl2a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>;</i>MZ<i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> with Lef1Mo, the number of cells in the pLLP was significantly lower than in MZ<i>amotl2a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>;</i>MZ<i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> double mutants (\u221219%, p = 0.001, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7N</a> \u2018f\u2019) and was not significantly different from that of MZ<i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants (\u2018g\u2019 in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7N</a>, p = 0.07). Altogether, these results strongly suggested that Amotl2a limits the number of cells and thus the size of the pLLP by repressing both Yap1 and Lef1 proliferation-promoting activities (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), possibly by physically interacting with Yap1 (our data) and \u03b2-catenin, as previously shown in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib50\">Li et al., 2012</a>)."

We further show that hyperplastic pLLP do not generate bigger neuromasts but more neuromasts. Our results indicate that Amotl2a exerts its function by negatively regulating both the Hippo pathway effector Yap1 and the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin effector Lef1. Our data point to a new mechanism by which Motin proteins limit tissue size by repressing the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. In addition, while Motin proteins are known to physically interact with, and inhibit YAP/TAZ, this is to our knowledge the first in vivo report showing that Motins control tissue size by interacting with the Hippo pathway effector Yap1 in a living organism."

Yet, proliferation must remain under tight spatiotemporal control to ensure that a sufficient number of cells is produced, but not exceeded. In the pLLP, Wnt/\u03b2catenin signaling is required to maintain proliferating progenitors in the leading region to compensate for the loss of cells resulting from neuromast deposition (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gamba et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aman et al., 2011</a>). This is essential for the pLLP to deposit a complete set of LL organs (<a href=\"#bib55\">McGraw et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Valdivia et al., 2011</a>). However, no mechanism has been proposed that restricts proliferation and growth in the pLLP. We show here that Amotl2a is essential to limit proliferation of the cells that assemble into proneuromasts in the trailing region of the pLLP. This leads us to propose that the size of the pLLP is controlled throughout migration by a balance between Wnt/\u03b2catenin-dependent mitogenic signals from the leading region and Amotl2a-dependent proliferation-restricting signals from the trailing region (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

This suggests that FGF has a mitogenic function in the pLLP in addition to promoting <i>amotl2a</i> expression, and thus, limiting proliferation. This is not surprising given that FGF signaling promotes proliferation in several contexts during vertebrate development (<a href=\"#bib73\">Thisse and Thisse, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Aman et al., 2011</a>). We propose that in FGF-deficient embryos, an increase in Yap1 and Lef1 activity resulting from decreased <i>amotl2a</i> expression might partially compensate for the absence of FGF-dependent proliferation."

Intriguingly, our results suggest that this number does not depend on the size of the pLLP itself. This is in agreement with the fact that smaller primordia, for example in <i>lef1</i> mutants, also deposit fewer, but apparently not smaller, neuromasts (<a href=\"#bib55\">McGraw et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Valdivia et al., 2011</a>)."

Second, we show that <i>lef1</i> expression is expanded upon loss of Amotl2a function. Interestingly, upon loss of Lef1 activity, rosettes assemble closer to the pLLP tip (<a href=\"#bib55\">McGraw et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Matsuda et al., 2013</a>). This has been attributed to the loss of the FGF pathway inhibitor Dusp6 downstream of Lef1 leading to a premature incorporation of leading cells into epithelial rosettes (<a href=\"#bib55\">McGraw et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Matsuda et al., 2013</a>). The expansion of <i>lef1</i> expression into the trailing region upon loss of Amotl2a function could conversely explain the delay in rosette assembly. That this delay does not result in an increased distance between deposited neuromasts could be explained by the fact that one additional neuromast form in this context due to the increase in cell number."

In <i>amotl2a</i> mutants, Yap1 activity would fail to be repressed and would remain higher for a longer period of time leading to overproliferation.

Intriguingly, both our <i>yap1</i> morphants and mutants showed significantly different phenotypes with a reduction of the size of the pLLP but not of the number of neuromasts deposited. In addition, neither <i>prox1</i> expression nor the numbers of hair cells were affected in <i>yap1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants. One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that our <i>yap1</i> mutation does not affect all <i>yap1</i> transcripts. This is, however, unlikely since it lies in the TEAD-binding domain, which is probably essential to Yap1 function. On the other hand, the authors also reported increased apoptosis and activation of the p53 pathway, two processes that have been shown to lead to a reduction in the number of neuromasts (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aman et al., 2011</a>).

Our results raise the question whether Yap1 responds to such changes in the pLLP, and to which extent the response depends on Amotl2a function. We show that the repressive function of Amotl2a on Yap1 coincides with the assembly of cells into rosettes. Interestingly, these cells undergo a number of changes including epithelialization, acquisition of a columnar shape, and apical constriction via acto-myosin contraction (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lecaudey et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ernst et al., 2012</a>). In principle, Yap1 could respond to any of these changes and Amotl2a could act as a mediator. First, tight junction-associated Amotl2a in newly formed rosettes could recruit and inhibit Yap1. In addition, Motins, including Amotl2a (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hultin et al., 2014</a>), can bind actin and this interaction has been shown to compete with the binding of Motin to YAP (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ernkvist et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dai et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gaspar and Tapon, 2014</a>).

In contrast at high density, cells are compact and tall and this is associated with cytoplasmic localization of YAP. In the pLLP, cells in the leading region are rather flat while cells in the trailing region, which assemble into rosettes, are more columnar (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lecaudey et al., 2008</a>). Thus, in the primordium, more than the cell density, the assembly of cells into rosettes and the associated changes in cell shape could regulate the cytoplasmic localization of Yap1 in an Amotl2a-dependent manner. Such a mechanism would allow to couple proliferation rate to organogenesis. Upon loss of Amotl2a, in contrast, this coupling would be lost so that proneuromasts assemble but proliferation is not restricted, leading to hyperplastic LLP and additional sensory organs."

The Loh et al. study also undertook a microarray study with their morphants, and reported changes in Wnt signalling pathway genes, whereas the current manuscript states that Wnt signalling is unaffected in their <i>amotl2a</i> morphants, but do not show the data (second paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). In order to address these discrepancies, and given the known importance of Wnt signalling in lateral line proliferation, the authors should show an analysis of Wnt signalling in both the <i>amotl2a</i> and <i>yap1</i> mutants, and should cite and discuss the Loh et al. study."

Although most of the loss-of-function analyses were carried out by using morpholinos, they confirmed the phenotype by the TALEN induced mutants of <i>amotl2a</i> and YAP. They first showed that <i>amotl2a</i> expression is dependent on FGF signaling. They next showed that Amotl2a limits the pLLP size by restricting YAP mediated cell proliferation. Finally, based on the rescue experiment they concluded that restricting cell proliferation is mediated by the physical interaction of Amotl2a and YAP. Whereas the over-proliferation of pPPL in the <i>amotl2a</i> mutant is interesting, the mechanisms presented in the manuscript are mostly reported previously, e.g. FGF dependent expression of <i>amotl2a</i> and physical interaction of Amotl2a and YAP. Some of the conclusions are overstated. Indeed, there are alternative interpretations for the result of the rescue experiment as detailed below. Furthermore, more in depth analysis taking advantage of the zebrafish in vivo system would be necessary to publish this manuscript in this journal."

My concern is that the negative result (failure of rescue) even together with the evidence of the physical interaction does not fully support such a strong statement. The failure of rescue could be due to the instability of the mutant Amotl2a without YAP binding sites. The authors have to check the stability of the mutant Amotl2a protein. If the mutant Amotl2a is not less stable, overexpression of this protein could interfere with the interaction of endogenous Amotl2a and YAP and it might induce the dominant-negative phenotype."

Although the role of Prox1a in hair cell specification was not examined in this paper, the mutant does not show the lymphatic phenotype previously described using Morpholino-mediated knock-down.
