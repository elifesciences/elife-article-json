Although a few male-harming mtDNA mutations have been identified, consistent with this \u2018Mother\u2019s Curse\u2019, their effect on females has been largely unexplored. Here, we identify COII<sup>G177S</sup>, a mtDNA hypomorph of cytochrome oxidase II, which specifically impairs male fertility due to defects in sperm development and function without impairing other male or female functions. COII<sup>G177S</sup> represents one of the clearest examples of a \u2018male-harming\u2019 mtDNA mutation in animals and suggest that the hypomorphic mtDNA mutations like COII<sup>G177S</sup> might specifically impair male gametogenesis. Intriguingly, some <i>D. melanogaster</i> nuclear genetic backgrounds can fully rescue COII<sup>G177S</sup> -associated sterility, consistent with previously proposed models that nuclear genomes can regulate the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutations."

Although a few male-harming mtDNA mutations have been identified, consistent with this \u2018Mother\u2019s Curse\u2019, their effect on females has been largely unexplored. Here, we identify COII<sup>G177S</sup>, a mtDNA hypomorph of cytochrome oxidase II, which specifically impairs male fertility due to defects in sperm development and function without impairing other male or female functions. COII<sup>G177S</sup> represents one of the clearest examples of a \u2018male-harming\u2019 mtDNA mutation in animals and suggest that the hypomorphic mtDNA mutations like COII<sup>G177S</sup> might specifically impair male gametogenesis. Intriguingly, some <i>D. melanogaster</i> nuclear genetic backgrounds can fully rescue COII<sup>G177S</sup> -associated sterility, consistent with previously proposed models that nuclear genomes can regulate the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutations."

The mutation is said to be \u201chypomorphic\u201d because it lowers the activity of the gene. The fertility of male flies with this mutation rapidly declined as they aged. However, the mutation did not appear to lower the fertility of female flies. In fact, apart from the lower male fertility, the mitochondrial mutation did not seem to affect any other traits in males or females."

This supports previous findings that the effect of mitochondrial mutations in animals and plants may be complex and can be strongly influenced by the genes in their nucleus."

This symbiosis gave the eukaryotic cell the ability to perform oxidative phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib69\">Williams et al., 2013</a>). In modern eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation is carried out by the electron transport chain, which comprises subunits encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA). Oxidative phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in many eukaryotes and is responsible for meeting most cellular energy demands. In humans, dysfunction of oxidative phosphorylation is associated with many diseases including cancer, diabetes, infertility, and neurodegenerative disorders (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wallace, 2001</a>)."

This conflict arises from the differences in transmission between the two genomes. Whereas the nuclear genome is transmitted in a Mendelian fashion through both sexes, mtDNA is exclusively maternally inherited in most metazoans. Indeed, there are elaborate mechanisms to prevent the inheritance of sperm mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib5\">Birky, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Al Rawi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sato and Sato, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">DeLuca and O'Farrell, 2012</a>). Due to this uniparental inheritance, natural selection for mtDNA fitness can operate in females but not in males. As a result of this relaxed selection, 'male-harming' mtDNA mutations are expected to accumulate as long as they are beneficial, neutral or nearly neutral in females, a scenario referred to as the \u2018Mother\u2019s Curse\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Frank and Hurst, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gemmell et al., 2004</a>). However, since decreased male fitness is detrimental for the evolutionary success of the nuclear genome, outbred populations subject to accumulation of male-harming mtDNA mutations can rapidly evolve nuclear genome-encoded suppressors to restore male fitness (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rand et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Dowling et al., 2008</a>). Thus, evolutionary theory predicts a conflict-driven molecular arms race between mtDNA and the nuclear genome."

One of the best-understood examples of such \u2018male-harming\u2019 mtDNA mutations are <i>cytoplasmic male sterility (cms)</i> mutants described in many plant species (<a href=\"#bib6\">Budar et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chase, 2007</a>). Such <i>cms</i> mtDNA can induce male sterility in hermaphroditic plants that can be cross-pollinated. By reallocating resources for pollen production instead for production of seeds, <i>cms</i> mtDNA increase female fitness \u2013 and consequently increase their own fitness (<a href=\"#bib6\">Budar et al., 2003</a>). Molecular characterization of <i>cms</i> mutants shows that their \u2018male-harming\u2019 (and female-beneficial) properties are caused by novel chimeric genes that are created via recombination between mtDNA molecules. Nuclear-encoded suppressors of <i>cms</i> belong to the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family and use RNA editing to effectively neutralize these male-harming chimeric genes in mtDNA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Budar et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chase, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Castandet and Araya, 2012</a>)."

Despite these limitations, there is evidence that mutations in animal mtDNA genes might be male-harming. For example, mtDNA haplogroup T in humans is associated with reduced sperm motility (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ruiz-Pesini et al., 2000</a>). Polymorphisms in mtDNA that cause this phenotype are hypothesized to be significant contributors to untreatable male subfertility, known to affect 7\u201310% of men (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker, 1994</a>). Recent findings implicate mtDNA variation as a significant contributor to shorter male lifespans in many taxa (<a href=\"#bib19\">Clancy, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Camus et al., 2012</a>). Although the phenotypic consequences of these mtDNA mutations are severe in males, it remains unclear whether they are benign in females, <i>i.e.,</i> whether they are specifically \u2018male-harming\u2019 mtDNA mutations as predicted by the Mother\u2019s Curse hypothesis."

First, in natural populations, there can be significant indirect selection on mtDNA to maintain male fitness when the fitness of females is dependent on related males (those with the same mtDNA) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wade and Brandvain, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hedrick, 2012</a>).

Effects of detrimental mtDNA variants could thus only be evident if they were separated from their nuclear-encoded suppressors. With this goal, many researchers have created combinations of nuclear and mtDNA genomes in <i>D. melanogaster</i>, either from different strains or species (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rand et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Maklakov et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rand et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">Dowling et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Montooth et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Correa et al., 2012</a>). Such combinations have revealed instances of dramatic incompatibility, even within species, which results in male but not female lifespan defects (<a href=\"#bib9\">Camus et al., 2012</a>). Variation in mtDNA also affects sperm competitiveness in <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib74\">Yee et al., 2013</a>). While these elegant experiments have revealed mtDNA-dependent affects on male lifespan and fertility, they did not comprehensively assess affects on female life-history traits; it is thus unclear whether these mutations are specifically male-harming. One further limitation of such mtDNA \u2018swaps\u2019 is that introduced mtDNA often have several co-inherited mutations. This linkage of different mutations makes it nearly impossible to implicate single mutations as being causal for the incompatibility or to understand their biological mechanism. An exception is a single point mutation in <i>D. melanogaster</i> mtDNA that has been causally linked to male sterility (<a href=\"#bib18\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>). However, recent demonstration of this mtDNA haplotype\u2019s negative pleiotropic effects on fertility and aging, both within and between sexes suggests it is not a specifically male-harming mutation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Camus et al., 2015</a>). Thus, we currently lack clear examples of specifically male-harming mtDNA mutations in animals. This has also left unanswered the larger question of molecular mechanisms by which mtDNA mutations can manifest their \u2018male-harming\u2019 phenotypes."

Cellular characterization reveals decreased sperm production and function in the mutant males.

In our strategy, <i>D. melanogaster</i> females are prevented from mating with their male siblings. Instead, virgin females are mated to na\u00efve males from an external stock every generation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This strategy is predicted to eliminate indirect selection against male-harming mtDNA mutations because the fitness of the population is not dependent on the males carrying the mtDNA mutations; mtDNA are effectively absolved from supporting male fitness (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wade and Brandvain, 2009</a>). Moreover, continuous replacement of a large fraction of the nuclear genome every generation via crosses to external males practically eliminates the likelihood of evolution of nuclear suppressors during the course of the experiment. In contrast, selection of mtDNA function for female fitness is stringently maintained over the entire course of the experiment. Thus, we anticipated this experimental evolution strategy might provide a permissive environment for accumulation and phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutations that are beneficial, neutral, or nearly neutral (only slightly deleterious) in females but cause defects in males."

Under this strategy, mtDNA is sequenced at very high depth of coverage, labeling individual DNA molecules and sequencing each one multiple times in order to distinguish true mutations from sequencing errors. This strategy allows for sensitive evaluation of heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations. We found no evidence for wildtype mtDNA sequence in a pool of flies that we had re-isolated to enrich for the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant mtDNA (0 duplex consensus reads out of &gt;7000). In contrast, we found no evidence for the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant mtDNA in flies (0 reads out of &gt;7000) that we had re-isolated from the same original w1118 stock to enrich for wildtype mtDNA. We were cognizant that although the pooled COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant flies showed no evidence of wild-type sequence, some heteroplasmy may nevertheless persist in individual flies. We therefore also sequenced 7 individual flies from the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant mtDNA pool to high depth of coverage. For six flies, we found no reads (out of &gt;8,000) corresponding to wildtype mtDNA, whereas in one fly we uncovered seven out of &gt;11,000 reads corresponding to wildtype mtDNA (&lt;0.1%). We therefore conclude that the re-isolated strains are almost completely homoplasmic for either COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant mtDNA or wildtype mtDNA.

We therefore investigated the effect of higher temperature on the fertility defect in COII<sup>G177S</sup> males. We found that COII<sup>G177S</sup> males are almost completely sterile when raised at 29\u00b0C instead of at 25\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Furthermore, we found that this defect manifests in both old and young males (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

                                "text": "Next, we investigated the molecular consequences of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation. COII is a subunit of cytochrome C oxidase (COX), which oxidizes the reduced form of cytochrome c. The glycine residue at position 177 is found in a loop of COII\u2019s structure where it comes in very close proximity to subunit I of the enzymatic complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Based on the fact that G177 is highly conserved across metazoans (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), we hypothesized that the G177S mutation affects either an intrinsic function of COII or its interaction with other proteins in complex IV of the electron transport chain. To understand the biochemical consequences of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation, we measured COX activity from whole fly lysates of flies grown at 25\u00b0C. Although the COX activity in COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant flies was slightly lower than flies with wild-type mtDNA, this defect was not statistically significant, even in old flies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We therefore measured COX activity from flies raised at 29\u00b0C where male fertility is most significantly impaired. Our analyses revealed an approximately 20% decrease in COX enzymatic activity in COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutants grown at 29\u00b0C in both male and female flies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Given that the activity of the electron transport chain is coupled to ATP synthesis, we also measured ATP levels at 29\u00b0C. In contrast to COX activity, we did not observe a decrease in ATP levels in the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). However, we did observe a mild but significant decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus, impaired COX activity and reduced ROS levels, but not ATP production, appear to correlate with loss of male fertility."

We find that mating wildtype females with COII<sup>G177S</sup> males induces egg-laying just as robustly as in females mated with males carrying wildtype mtDNA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). However, almost all of the eggs laid by females mated with COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant males were unfertilized and failed to hatch (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

We therefore carried out similar experiments in aged males at 25\u00b0C, which also had displayed a reduction in fertility. Just like young COII<sup>G177S</sup> males at 29\u00b0C, we found that aged COII<sup>G177S</sup> males at 25\u00b0C also had reduced seminal vesicle size compared to aged males with wildtype mtDNA (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Hence, the restoration of fertility that we observe could simply reflect greater tolerance to high temperature independent of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA. To address this possibility, we measured total fertility of males until 21 days of age at 25\u00b0C. We found that the Oregon R nuclear background suppresses not only the young male sterility at 29\u00b0C but also male fertility at 25\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, we conclude that the Oregon R nuclear background encodes a <i>bona fide</i> suppressor of COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA-mediated male infertility. We currently don\u2019t know the identity of the suppressor loci or whether these are specific only to the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation. For instance, these suppressors might employ a general mechanism that allows for rescue of male fitness defects caused by other mtDNA mutations. Under either scenario, we hypothesized that COII<sup>G177S</sup> suppressor loci may be more abundant across <i>D. melanogaster</i> strains."

We also evaluated the biochemical consequence of such nuclear suppression of COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA\u2019s male sterility to distinguish between two possible mechanisms of suppression. Under the first alternative, restoration of fertility in COII<sup>G177S</sup> males might be due to higher baseline COX activity in the suppressor background, which can compensate for the hypomorphic COII<sup>G177S</sup> and therefore be sufficient for sperm development and motility. Under this scenario, there would still be a difference in COX activity between wildtype and COII<sup>G177S</sup> flies. A second alternative is that there is no difference in COX activity in flies carrying wildtype or COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA. When we measured COX activity in the suppressed nuclear background, we found the second scenario to be true <i>i.e.,</i> COX activity is the same in wildtype and COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA-bearing males (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10F</a>).

Thus, the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA is decoupled from its transmission in males.

It is possible that the experimental evolution scheme might have created the permissive conditions that allowed this mtDNA mutation to rise to fixation in one strain. However, the fact that it did not rise to fixation in the other experimental populations means that we cannot conclude that the experimental strategy itself was causally important for the fixation of this male-harming mtDNA mutant. Future work on fine-tuning the strategy can address its effectiveness. For example, the scheme can be improved by increasing mtDNA mutation rates to improve sampling of <i>de novo</i> mutations, perhaps by employing a mutator mtDNA polymerase before initiating the experimental evolution scheme (<a href=\"#bib64\">Trifunovic et al., 2004</a>). Alternatively, random chemical mutagenesis might also be readily applied here in our scheme. Although such chemical mutagenesis will affect both mtDNA and nuclear genomes initially, backcrossing to \u2018original stock\u2019 males in our scheme will rapidly replace most mutated nuclear genes with wildtype versions, while enabling the transmission of mtDNA mutations that do not affect female fitness. Finally, combining the crossing scheme we propose with the targeted restriction endonuclease strategy to generate mtDNA mutations (<a href=\"#bib73\">Xu et al., 2008</a>) might be a facile means to discriminate specifically \u2018male-harming\u2019 mtDNA mutations from those that grossly impair mtDNA function."

These data are consistent with the \u2018selective sieve\u2019 model, which predicts that even mutations that are neutral or nearly neutral in females but deleterious in males might be common because they cannot be effectively removed by natural selection (<a href=\"#bib37\">Innocenti et al., 2011</a>).

The COX activity decline specifically impaired sperm production and function. This establishes COII<sup>G177S</sup> as one of the first <i>bona fide</i> male-harming mtDNA mutations in animals. We considered the possibility that the phenotypic effects we have observed on male fertility are attributable to linked but unassayed changes in the 4-kb long AT-rich D loop control region of mtDNA. Indeed, the D-loop is one of the most rapidly evolving segments of mtDNA in <i>D. melanogaster</i>, but its highly repetitive nature challenges sequence characterization. However, our analyses allow us to directly implicate the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation as being causally linked to the phenotypes we have observed.

Two separate mutations in mtDNA are known to cause male sterility in <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib73\">Xu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>).

According to this hypothesis, although all tissues suffer from the relative reduction in COX activity, testis function is specifically impacted because it has a lower threshold of tolerance for a relative reduction in COX activity. In particular, COX activity might be required to facilitate the dramatic morphological changes that mitochondria undergo during sperm development in <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Fuller, 1998</a>). If this hypothesis is correct, mildly hypomorphic mutations like COII<sup>G177S</sup> might generally impair male fertility and thus represent a common mechanism of male-harming mtDNA mutations.

For instance, there is already evidence that mtDNA might harbor mutations that affect aging and lifespan, which is highly dimorphic between the sexes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Camus et al., 2012</a>). At the molecular level, COX activity was shown to be differentially affected in male versus female flies based on their mtDNA haplotype (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sackton et al., 2003</a>). Furthermore, almost 90% of the transcriptome in <i>D. melanogaster</i> is differentially expressed between the sexes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ayroles et al., 2009</a>). Amongst those differentially expressed genes, male-biased transcripts are enriched for mitochondrial energy metabolism, thus providing ample opportunities for sex-specific effects of mtDNA (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ayroles et al., 2009</a>). Consistent with the nuclear background exerting an effect on the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutants, we found that the COII<sup>G177S\u00a0</sup>-mediated sterility was suppressed in many of the <i>D. melanogaster</i> nuclear backgrounds tested. Thus, our study not only shows the existence and biological basis of a male-harming mutation, but also demonstrates importance of the intimate relationship between nuclear and mtDNA genomes for the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutations."

However, evidence of negative selection would show the some difficult-to-detect deficiency in the flies with the allele, and a positive selection signal would set up an interesting scenario of the allele being beneficial to the population, but detrimental to male fertility when fixed."

The reported results can be divided into three areas. In the first, the manuscript describes a strategy described as \"a novel experimental evolution scheme in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to recover male-harming mutations\". In the second, the phenotype of the temperature-enhanced sterility of the one mutation recovered is characterized. In the third, modification of the sterility affects by nuclear background is described. As discussed below, I found that the first part to harbor significant potential interest, but felt that the paper did not support the efficacy of the practice that it advocated. Nonetheless, they retrieved a male harming mutant, and second part of the manuscript describes its characterization. While this is an interesting mutant that fits the bill of a male harming mutant, I was somewhat uncertain about the value of the details of the phenotypic characterization. It seemed to me the details of the phenotype are likely to depend on the use of a high temperature to increase the expressivity of the defect. The analysis of enhancers in the third part of the paper is of great interest, but it was not advanced to level that gives us any insight into the nature of the interactions. In this regard, I was again concerned about the use of high temperature to enhance the phenotype. No attempt was made to disambiguate the influence of genetic background effects on the temperature range of fertility from a specific effect on the mutation, leaving a nagging suspicion that the effect of the nuclear background might not be very specific."

In this regard, it would be interesting to compare the frequency of male harming mtDNA mutations in well-mixed wild populations, to the frequency in the confined breeding populations of laboratory flies. According to the rationale, one might expect a substantial frequency of male harming mutants in wild populations that then fail when established as more inbred laboratory stocks."

The only recovered mutation was in the starting population at a very high level. The paper suggests in its wording that this was a fleeting thing caught by the breeding strategy: e.g. It is suggested that \"the mutant allele likely arose de novo in the original stock and transiently existed in a state of heteroplasmy before approaching homoplasmy in EL7\", and \"we devised an experimental evolution scheme to absolve mtDNA of supporting male function while both maintaining selection on female mtDNA function as well as reducing the possibility of nuclear suppression or male-harming mtDNA. Our scheme uncovered a COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation[\u2026]\". The idea of fleeting mutation present in the original stock that was captured by the \"experimental evolution scheme\" might support the idea that it was effective. However, it seems very unlikely that the mutation was fleeting and there is no evidence that the scheme was needed to capture it. Even rare changes can go to fixation in small populations and one out six assayed flies in the starting population was homoplasmic for the mutation. Over 35 generations (plus an unspecified number of generations of additional crosses in which the flies were allowed to self) drift will lead to dramatic fluctuations in the abundance of the homoplasmic line and to random fixation. Fixation of an already abundant mutation in one of 18 lines is no surprise and there is no foundation for a conclusion that this possibility was enhanced by the \"experimental evolution scheme\"."

Since the mutant persisted in the population as homoplasmic flies there is no indication that its presence was transient. Additionally, based on Solignac's (1984) detailed description of the gradual and statistical segregation of mtDNA genotypes one can make inferences about the behavior of a mutation in a stock \u2013 whether it is drifting randomly or is affected by selection. The only data shown regarding the distribution of heteroplasmy was an analysis of six flies of the original population. This is woefully inadequate for any detailed consideration of levels of heteroplasmy. A more thorough analysis might have revealed whether there was any constraint limiting the propagation of the mutant allele in the original stock, since such constraints, by selecting for different progeny classes, will alter the unbiased statistical changes in the distribution of heteroplasmy levels. Demonstration that a constraint existed would provide some foundation for the proposal that the \"experimental evolutionary scheme\" would have consequence-relief of this constraint. The crosses presented in this manuscript could have simply provided opportunity for random drift to fix an abundant pre-existing mutation. To make the claims regarding the \"experimental evolutionary scheme\", the manuscript would have to dismiss this null hypothesis and demonstrate the efficacy of the approach. At present, the appearance of one line out 12 with a mutant in the experimental sample and none in the 6 control lines is far from enough to argue that the outcrossing was essential to the recovery of the mutation."

It appears that the heteroplasmic male flies are fertile (not tested, but failure to see fertility depression in lines with high levels of mutant genomes suggest that mutant genomes can be carried without a phenotype) and hence that no such counter selection would operate early after the appearance of the mutant allele (when it is rare and heteroplasmic). The persistence of mutant flies (perhaps heteroplasmic, but untested) in three of the six coevolving/control lines suggests the absence of a significant counter selection preventing their maintenance. Consequently, male sterility could only come into play, if at all, very late after the mutation rose to be a dominant allele with frequent production of homoplasmic derivatives, and since the male sterility phenotype is weak at the temperatures used for propagation, it would not be surprising that secondary selection due to male fertility could prevent fixation of the mutant. Furthermore, since the scheme did not use unrelated males for outcrosses but used males from the starting population, which apparently harbored the mutant for many generations (many generations are essential to produce homoplasmic flies), these males might already have carried suppressors of the phenotype. Thus, I do not think that manuscript offers support for claim that an effective scheme for recovery of male-harming mutations is described. I would like to see direct evidence that it is effective and efficient."

One obfuscating issue is the use of high temperature to enhance the phenotype of an otherwise weak expressivity of the mitochondrial mutation. The highest temperature at which flies can be cultivated is generally limited by male sterility (e.g. David JR et al., 2005). For laboratory stocks, this highest temperature is usually taken as 29\u00b0C but populations tend to show differences in the temperature range across which they will grow-perhaps not surprisingly as environmental variables and adaptation would select for different ranges. At the temperature limit, defects in sperm development are usually seen as responsible for sterility (e.g. Rohmer C, et al., 2004). Interactions between nucleus, mitochondria and temperature have been described as affecting male sterility (Hoekstra et al., 2013). The manuscript shows an interaction of temperature and the mitochondrial mutation, but the study of the phenotype leaves an uncertainty whether the phenotype described is primarily that of the mutant or that produced at high temperature. That is, one might imagine that the mutation might sensitize the flies so that the high temperature defect shows up at 29\u00b0C, or one can imagine that 29\u00b0C increases the expressivity of the mutant phenotype, or something in between. In this regard, it would be nice to know if the sterile phenotype of <i>w1118</i> wild type flies when raised at temperatures beyond 29\u00b0C, resembles or is distinct from the phenotype as seen in the mutant at 29\u00b0C."

The loci responsible are not mapped or otherwise identified. Sequenced strains are analyzed but no mention is made of any finding emanating from this. I worry that modification might be the result of modification of temperature sensitivity. The things underlying this concern are that the maximal temperature of male fertility commonly vary between strains, genetic backgrounds that modified the reported phenotype are remarkably common, and the data shown for 29\u00b0C in the supplement of <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> shows that <i>w1118</i> is unusually weak even at the temperature selected as widely permissive. If the temperature is raised to say 31\u00b0C, the wild type <i>w1118</i> stock is likely to be male sterile: I would like to know whether temperature tolerance is increased (i.e. this male sterility expected for the wild-type <i>w1118</i> strain is suppressed) by out crossing of the wild type to the same strains that suppressed the mutant. This control might reveal that the recorded affects are due to expected widespread differences in thermo-tolerance. This concern that the modification may be due to a more generic affect is partly alleviated by the reported increase in Cox activity in suppressed mutant backgrounds."

Of two previous criticisms, the bigger one is that the data are not sufficient to document homoplasmy. While this could be serious flaw, it is very likely that the line is close to homogeneous and if it were not and the authors sampled flies that were heteroplastic in their tests of fertility they would have seen phenotypic variation. If the authors answer in this way, and put more guarded statements in their discussion, we would be satisfied on this account. The are other issues, on the phenotypic analysis which are more about making things more clear, particularly aspects that are buried in the supplementary data. Eliminating some unfounded discussion will bring more sharpness, but this is something that the authors are best placed to address. These are detailed below."

The change in the presentation has resolved one of the central concerns about the previous version of the manuscript that presented a crossing scheme as an effective selection for male harming mutations. The critiques, certainly mine, argued that this was not supported by the data and that the mitochondrial mutation preexisted and was uncovered by chance. The present draft still argues that this scheme should be effective, which I severely doubt based on pragmatics of mutation frequency and infrequent segregation of homoplasmic lines. I think that the unsubstantiated sentence in the current version saying that \"we reasoned that multiple mutations per mtDNA would be sampled in 35 generations across 18 lines\" should be eliminated or justified.This is completely untenable as shown by the mathematical analysis of the number of generations required for lines to progress to homoplasmy (See Solignac).

The authors do report a maternally inherited partial male sterility trait that is linked with an SNP mt:CoII. The recognized SNP may well be the cause of the phenotype, but the possibility of linked changes in the unsequenced 4kb regulatory region was not eliminated (note that this is the region that changes the most rapidly and spontaneous variants of this region have been shown to arise in laboratory stocks \u2013 see Rand). Furthermore, identification of a mitochondrial DNA mutation altering an electron transport component that causes male sterility is not entirely novel (see Xu). The manuscript does report a fairly detailed effort to characterize the defect and shows suppression of this defect in crosses that introduce different nuclear backgrounds. In this regard, it goes beyond other reports that argued for nuclear modification of phenotypes caused by mitochondrial mutations. In our opinion these findings are of interest and could constitute a significant advance. We are however, left with some hesitancy because the merit ought to lie in the rigor in of the documentation of the principles, and we see some shortcomings."

However, we agree with the reviewer concerns and have now performed additional experiments to address these points. We also showed in the original submission that the fertility phenotype is also present at 25\u00b0C but it manifests in older males. We now show that the cellular phenotype of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation is similar in older males at 25\u00b0C to the phenotype in young males at 29\u00b0C. We further show that sterility of young males at 29\u00b0C is suppressed by a nuclear background (OregonR) in a manner similar to the suppression of old males at 25\u00b0C. Thus, we feel that we have completely addressed with our new experiments the reviewer concerns that our sterility phenotype and its suppression are confounded by a requirement of high temperature. It bears reiterating that we performed many life-history trait measurements at both 25\u00b0C and 29\u00b0C; male fertility was the only phenotype affected suggesting that the sterility defect associated with COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA is highly specific."

Second, we would love to know the genetic identity of the suppressor. But the reviewer is doubtless aware that this is a significant endeavor involving at least a few years of work. The best demonstration of this suppressor mapping was a recent paper (Meikeljohn et al. PLOS Genetics 2013), which found a nuclear-encoded tRNA synthetase that epistatically interacts with and suppresses a mitochondrial tRNA mutation. This work appeared three years after the original observation of the incompatibility (Montooth et al. Evolution 2010). Furthermore, the identity of this suppressor mutation was suggested by the very nature of the mtDNA mutation in a tRNA gene. Our preliminary experiments and the fact that we see both partial and completely restoration of fertility suggest that the suppression involves multiple genetic loci, whose identification will require 2-3 years of additional work. We intend to aggressively pursue this, but we feel that lack of this identification does not affect the novelty or importance of our findings in the current study."

The closest that any studies have come to characterization of \u2018male-harming\u2019 mtDNA variants are the elegant series of experiments performed by the group of Damian Dowling, who showed that mtDNA haplotypes from different <i>D. melanogaster</i> strains affect aging in males but not females (Camus et al. 2012 Current Biology), and competitive male fertility (Yee et al. 2013 Current Biology). These studies did not comprehensively test the role of all mtDNA haplotypes on female fitness. Just to highlight the novelty of our finding, while our paper was under review at <i>eLife</i>, one mtDNA haplotype that was previously shown to deleteriously affect competitive male fertility was also shown to decrease female lifespan (Camus et al., 2015 Current Biology); such a mutation could not be considered specifically \u2018male-harming\u2019. In contrast, our work examined the impact of COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation on both males and females in the context of fertility, lifespan, neurological function, and stress resistance, each at normal and elevated temperatures, and in young and old individuals. Hence, we can conclude with significantly greater confidence than any other study published so far that a single mtDNA variant in metazoans can be specifically detrimental to males but neutral in females. We believe that this comprehensive characterization of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation is the most novel and impactful finding of our manuscript.

The idea of fleeting mutation present in the original stock that was captured by the \"experimental evolution scheme\" might support the idea that it was effective.

Even rare changes can go to fixation in small populations and one out six assayed flies in the starting population was homoplasmic for the mutation. Over 35 generations (plus an unspecified number of generations of additional crosses in which the flies were allowed to self) drift will lead to dramatic fluctuations in the abundance of the homoplasmic line and to random fixation. Fixation of an already abundant mutation in one of 18 lines is no surprise and there is no foundation for a conclusion that this possibility was enhanced by the \"experimental evolution scheme\".</i> "

Since the mutant persisted in the population as homoplasmic flies there is no indication that its presence was transient.

This is woefully inadequate for any detailed consideration of levels of heteroplasmy. A more thorough analysis might have revealed whether there was any constraint limiting the propagation of the mutant allele in the original stock, since such constraints, by selecting for different progeny classes, will alter the unbiased statistical changes in the distribution of heteroplasmy levels.

It appears that the heteroplasmic male flies are fertile (not tested, but failure to see fertility depression in lines with high levels of mutant genomes suggest that mutant genomes can be carried without a phenotype) and hence that no such counter selection would operate early after the appearance of the mutant allele (when it is rare and heteroplasmic). The persistence of mutant flies (perhaps heteroplasmic, but untested) in three of the six coevolving/control lines suggests the absence of a significant counter selection preventing their maintenance. Consequently, male sterility could only come into play, if at all, very late after the mutation rose to be a dominant allele with frequent production of homoplasmic derivatives, and since the male sterility phenotype is weak at the temperatures used for propagation, it would not be surprising that secondary selection due to male fertility could prevent fixation of the mutant. Furthermore, since the scheme did not use unrelated males for outcrosses but used males from the starting population, which apparently harbored the mutant for many generations (many generations are essential to produce homoplasmic flies), these males might already have carried suppressors of the phenotype. Thus, I do not think that manuscript offers support for claim that an effective scheme for recovery of male-harming mutations is described. I would like to see direct evidence that it is effective and efficient.</i>"

One obfuscating issue is the use of high temperature to enhance the phenotype of an otherwise weak expressivity of the mitochondrial mutation. The highest temperature at which flies can be cultivated is generally limited by male sterility (e.g. David JR et al., 2005). For laboratory stocks, this highest temperature is usually taken as 29\u00b0C but populations tend to show differences in the temperature range across which they will grow-perhaps not surprisingly as environmental variables and adaptation would select for different ranges. At the temperature limit, defects in sperm development are usually seen as responsible for sterility (e.g. Rohmer C, et al., 2004). Interactions between nucleus, mitochondria and temperature have been described as affecting male sterility (Hoekstra et al., 2013). The manuscript shows an interaction of temperature and the mitochondrial mutation, but the study of the phenotype leaves an uncertainty whether the phenotype described is primarily that of the mutant or that produced at high temperature. That is, one might imagine that the mutation might sensitize the flies so that the high temperature defect shows up at 29\u00b0C, or one can imagine that 29\u00b0C increases the expressivity of the mutant phenotype, or something in between. In this regard, it would be nice to know if the sterile phenotype of w1118 wild type flies when raised at temperatures beyond 29\u00b0C, resembles or is distinct from the phenotype as seen in the mutant at 29\u00b0C.</i>"

We now show that the age-dependent infertility (performed at 25\u00b0C) is exactly what we would predict using additional cytological analysis of seminal vesicles, which we have shown is an accurate surrogate for male fertility. We find that the seminal vesicle size of COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant males is reduced compared to those with wildtype mtDNA, similar to what we found with young males raised at 29\u00b0C. Moreover, while <i>w1118</i> males with wildtype mtDNA also show impairment at 29\u00b0C, their seminal vesicle sizes are not significantly reduced. Our additional experiments show that the infertility defect cannot be solely explained as a confounding factor with temperature, and that the temperature-dependent reduction of fertility in wildtype <i>w1118</i> males is distinct from COII<sup>G177S</sup>-dependent defect at 29\u00b0C. We hope that our additional experiments should satisfy the reviewer\u2019s concerns regarding this criticism. Moreover, we must emphasize again that this is, to the best of our knowledge, the most detailed characterization of the phenotypic consequences of multiple life-history traits (aging, fertility, neural function) in young and old males and females, at two different temperatures."

The loci responsible are not mapped or otherwise identified. Sequenced strains are analyzed but no mention is made of any finding emanating from this. I worry that modification might be the result of modification of temperature sensitivity. The things underlying this concern are that the maximal temperature of male fertility commonly vary between strains, genetic backgrounds that modified the reported phenotype are remarkably common, and the data shown for 29\u00b0C in the supplement of <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> shows that w1118 is unusually weak even at the temperature selected as widely permissive. If the temperature is raised to say 31\u00b0C, the wild type w1118 stock is likely to be male sterile: I would like to know whether temperature tolerance is increased (i.e. this male sterility expected for the wild-type w1118 strain is suppressed) by out crossing of the wild type to the same strains that suppressed the mutant. This control might reveal that the recorded affects are due to expected widespread differences in thermo-tolerance. This concern that the modification may be due to a more generic affect is partly alleviated by the reported increase in Cox activity in suppressed mutant backgrounds.</i> "

Once again, using aged males, we show that the heterozygous OregonR nuclear background completely rescues (old) male fertility defects at 25\u00b0C that are caused by the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation and that this fertility rescue is associated with suppression of the decrease in seminal vesicle size. Together with our earlier presented data, our findings strongly suggest that the OregonR nuclear genome harbors a \u2018true\u2019 suppressor of the COII<sup>G177s</sup>-dependent male fertility defect and its mechanism of suppression is likely the same at 25\u00b0C and 29\u00b0C. We hope that our revised manuscript emphasizing our detailed characterization of how a hypomorphic mtDNA mutation can cause male-specific impairment will be viewed favorably by the reviewer. While we share the reviewer\u2019s excitement about the potential mapping of these nuclear suppressors, we point out that this is not a trivial undertaking.

While this could be serious flaw, it is very likely that the line is close to homogeneous and if it were not and the authors sampled flies that were heteroplastic in their tests of fertility they would have seen phenotypic variation. If the authors answer in this way, and put more guarded statements in their discussion, we would be satisfied on this account.

The change in the presentation has resolved one of the central concerns about the previous version of the manuscript that presented a crossing scheme as an effective selection for male harming mutations. The critiques, certainly mine, argued that this was not supported by the data and that the mitochondrial mutation preexisted and was uncovered by chance. The present draft still argues that this scheme should be effective, which I severely doubt based on pragmatics of mutation frequency and infrequent segregation of homoplasmic lines. I think that the unsubstantiated sentence in the current version saying that \"we reasoned that multiple mutations per mtDNA would be sampled in 35 generations across 18 lines\" should be eliminated or justified.This is completely untenable as shown by the mathematical analysis of the number of generations required for lines to progress to homoplasmy (See Solignac).

In addition, while mtDNA segregation can take many generations to reach homoplasmy, dramatic instances of rapid shifts in heteroplasmy have also been observed in humans, cows, and flies (Brown et al., 2001; Hauswirth & Laipis, 1982; Olivo et al., 1983; Matsuura et al., 1990; Matsuura et al., 1991; Koehler et al., 1991; Jenuth et al., 1996; Matsuura et al., 1997; Sato et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2012; Freyer et al., 2012; Sharpley et al., 2012; Ma, Xu & O\u2019Farrell, 2014; Ma & O\u2019Farrell, 2015; Ma & O\u2019Farrell, 2016).

Furthermore, identification of a mitochondrial DNA mutation altering an electron transport component that causes male sterility is not entirely novel (see Xu). The manuscript does report a fairly detailed effort to characterize the defect and shows suppression of this defect in crosses that introduce different nuclear backgrounds. In this regard, it goes beyond other reports that argued for nuclear modification of phenotypes caused by mitochondrial mutations. In our opinion these findings are of interest and could constitute a significant advance. We are however, left with some hesitancy because the merit ought to lie in the rigor in of the documentation of the principles, and we see some shortcomings.</i>"

We have observed a biochemical defect in cytochrome C oxidase activity that correlates perfectly with the male infertility phenotype. This COX activity is rescued in the suppressor background \u2013 these data strongly suggest that the G177S mutation causes the COX defect, which in turn causes the fertility defect. This is as strong a statement that can be made with a causal connection with a single mtDNA mutation, the exception being the Xu et al. paper that used a restriction enzyme strategy to introduce mtDNA mutations. In all other cases that have mapped a phenotype to a single mutation in mtDNA they did not assay or sequence the A+T region (Camus et al. 2015, Meiklejohn et al. 2013, Clancy et al., 2011, Xu et al. 2008, and Clancy 2008)."

Even though both mutants had a male sterility defect (<i>mt:CoI<sup>R301L</sup></i>was completely male sterile), the authors observed no defects in cytochrome oxidase activity and spermatogenesis. Instead, the infertility was reported due to a defect in sperm storage. Thus, we have a unique manifestation of a male-harming mtDNA mutant.
