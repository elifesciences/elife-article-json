It has not been possible to study actin in vivo and so its physiological roles have remained obscure, leading to models distinct from conventional actin behaviour. Here a modified version of the commercially available actin-chromobody was tested as a novel tool for visualising F-actin dynamics in <i>Toxoplasma gondii.</i> Cb labels filamentous actin structures within the parasite cytosol and labels an extensive F-actin network that connects parasites within the parasitophorous vacuole and allows vesicles to be exchanged between parasites. In the absence of actin, parasites lack a residual body and inter-parasite connections and grow in an asynchronous and disorganized manner. Collectively, these data identify new roles for actin in the intracellular phase of the parasites lytic cycle and provide a robust new tool for imaging parasitic F-actin dynamics."

It has not been possible to study actin in vivo and so its physiological roles have remained obscure, leading to models distinct from conventional actin behaviour. Here a modified version of the commercially available actin-chromobody was tested as a novel tool for visualising F-actin dynamics in <i>Toxoplasma gondii.</i> Cb labels filamentous actin structures within the parasite cytosol and labels an extensive F-actin network that connects parasites within the parasitophorous vacuole and allows vesicles to be exchanged between parasites. In the absence of actin, parasites lack a residual body and inter-parasite connections and grow in an asynchronous and disorganized manner. Collectively, these data identify new roles for actin in the intracellular phase of the parasites lytic cycle and provide a robust new tool for imaging parasitic F-actin dynamics."

The parasite then spreads and infects more host cells. The replication is synchronised, meaning all parasites in a host cell replicate at the same time. It was unclear how the parasites coordinated this process, but some researchers suggested that the parasites remained connected to each other to communicate by exchanging material and information. A good candidate to form such connections is the protein actin, which in many organisms forms filaments that guide the transport of cargo molecules in the cell. However, previous research indicated that actin in <i>T. gondii</i> is incapable of forming these stable filaments."

The pathological manifestation is caused in a large part by repeated rounds of the parasite\u2019s lytic cycle, beginning with active invasion of the host cell by the parasite, replication within a specialized vacuole termed the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), followed by egress and lysis of the host cell. Replication occurs via a unique process of endodyogeny, where two daughter parasites are constructed within the mother, before elongating and budding, leading to the breakdown of the maternal parasite (<a href=\"#bib18\">Francia and Striepen, 2014</a>). Remnants of the mother cell remain at the posterior end of the daughter parasites in a structure known as the residual body (RB), which has a role in organizing the parasites into their characteristic rosette pattern within the PV (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mu\u00f1iz-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hu et al., 2002</a>). Membrane connections persist between the RB and the parasites until host cell lysis and parasite egress, presumably to allow inter-parasite communication (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mu\u00f1iz-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2011</a>). To date little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes. Previous studies focused on the role of microtubules during parasite replication, since treatment with microtubule inhibitors leads to structural collapse of the parasite, while actin-modulating drugs are thought to cause only slight defects in replication (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shaw et al., 2000</a>). In contrast, research on parasite actin focused on its crucial role during host cell invasion and egress (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dobrowolski and Sibley, 1996</a>). However, recent studies have also implicated actin and myosins in intracellular processes including apicoplast division (<a href=\"#bib16\">Egarter et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andenmatten et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jacot et al., 2013</a>), secretory organelle (dense granule) transport (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heaslip et al., 2016</a>) and parasite replication (<a href=\"#bib19\">Haase et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "Actin is a highly conserved protein, which forms dynamic filaments in eukaryotic cells. Through an association with actin-binding proteins, these filaments are themselves organized into higher order structures that play important roles in a wide variety of cellular functions including muscle contraction, vesicle transport and cytokinesis. <i>T. gondii</i> actin is encoded by a single gene, <i>act1</i> and has only\u00a0~80% sequence identity with mammalian actin isoforms but shares 93% similarity with <i>Plasmodium</i> ACT1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dobrowolski et al., 1997</a>). Apicomplexan ACT1 is clearly essential, and compared to its counterparts in higher eukaryotes is believed to be intrinsically unstable, resulting in the formation of only short filaments (<a href=\"#bib48\">Skillman et al., 2011</a>). Biochemical assays indicate that 97% of the parasites actin is present in the globular form <a href=\"#bib13\">(Dobrowolski et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Skillman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wetzel et al., 2003</a>). It has been proposed that apicomplexan actin is unique amongst actins as it polymerizes in a highly unusual, isodesmic manner (<a href=\"#bib49\">Skillman et al., 2013</a>). According to the isodesmic polymerisation model, monomer addition is governed by a single equilibrium constant, meaning that no (unfavourable) activation step is required to initiate the formation of the first dimer leading to polymerisation. In this instance, nucleation and elongation are equally favourable. This contrasts to cooperative polymerisation, where the activation step is the formation of the first dimer/trimer, which has a higher equilibrium constant than polymer elongation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Smulders et al., 2010</a>). Therefore polymer formation can only occur above a critical concentration (Cc) of monomers (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pantaloni et al., 1985</a>). It is this activation step that is regulated by actin nucleators, such as the Arp2/3 complex or formins (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carlier et al., 2015</a>). Puzzlingly, formins and other actin nucleating proteins have been shown to have essential roles in <i>Toxoplasma</i> and <i>Plasmodium,</i> begging the question of their function if they are not required to initiate actin polymerisation or accelerate filament elongation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baum et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jacot et al., 2013</a>). A recent study suggested that the polymerization process of apicomplexan actin needs to be reinvestigated, as heterologously expressed apicomplexan actin, the basis for many of the previous studies, is incorrectly folded (<a href=\"#bib37\">Olshina et al., 2016</a>). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that conditional deletion of <i>act1</i> in <i>T. gondii</i> results in complete abrogation of known actin functions, long before G-actin levels are fully depleted, suggesting that in vivo the formation of F-actin depends on a critical monomer concentration (<a href=\"#bib54\">Whitelaw et al., 2017</a>). This raises concerns about previous studies of actin polymerization kinetics based on mis-folded actin. Furthermore, imaging studies on different life cycle stages of the apicomplexan parasite, <i>Plasmodium falciparum,</i> demonstrated the formation of an extensive F-actin cytoskeleton in both gametocytes and ookinetes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hliscs et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Siden-Kiamos et al., 2012</a>). Using 3D-SIM it was demonstrated in gametocytes that these filaments appear to be organized in the cytoplasm, below the Inner Membrane Complex (IMC; a specialised structure found in apicomplexans that consists of membranous vesicles and structural components located just beneath the plasma membrane) of the parasite rather than between the IMC and the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hliscs et al., 2015</a>), where it is thought to power parasite gliding motility (<a href=\"#bib34\">Meissner et al., 2013</a>)."

We demonstrate that <i>act1</i> cKO parasites lack a residual body and grow in an asynchronous and disorganized manner within the PV. Further investigation of actin functions required imaging the filamentous actin cytoskeleton. Previous attempts to visualise F-actin within the parasites have largely been unsuccessful, since conventional actin labelling techniques such as Life-Act, Phalloidin and SiR-Act do not allow detection of F-actin within the parasites. GFP-actin shows a high signal to noise ratio in parasites causing the inability to differentiate actin filaments from the monomeric form <a href=\"#bib3\">Angrisano et al. (2012a)</a>. Thus we sought a new approach to image F-actin in intracellular parasites by expressing actin-chromobody, a single chain anti-actin camel antibody that has been successfully employed in diverse eukaryotes, including plants (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rocchetti et al., 2014</a>) and animal cells (<a href=\"#bib41\">Plessner et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Panza et al., 2015</a>). Chromobodies (Cb) were found to have several advantages compared to other actin probes, such as lower toxicity, less influence on F-actin dynamics and a high signal to noise ratio (<a href=\"#bib40\">Panza et al., 2015</a>). Using this probe, we were able to visualise filamentous actin in live parasites. While some filamentous structures were seen within the parasite cytosol as expected, we were surprised to observe extensive F-actin networks in the RB and F-actin-containing membranous tubules linking parasites within a vacuole. These tubules appear to be involved in the transport of material between parasites and recycling of the mother IMC at the end of the replication cycle. Collectively, these data identify new roles for actin in the intracellular phase of the parasites lytic cycle and provide a robust new tool for imaging parasitic F-actin dynamics."

Additionally, a recent study demonstrated a role for actin in parasite replication (<a href=\"#bib19\">Haase et al., 2015</a>) and thus we used the <i>act1 cKO</i> to further examine the role of actin in parasite growth. Although initially intracellular <i>act1 cKO</i> parasites replicate at comparable rate to wild-type parasites (<a href=\"#bib16\">Egarter et al., 2014</a>), they grew asynchronously and appeared disorganised, without the characteristic rosette organization of parasites in the parasitophorous vacuole (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>). While parasites replicate normally up to the 4 cell stage, later divisions are not tightly synchronised (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), meaning that within the same PV parasites can be identified that are at different stages of endodyogeny (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, arrow). In addition, the intravacuolar network, as visualised using Gra2 antibodies (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mercier et al., 1993</a>), appeared disorganised and malformed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of intracellular parasites, we observed that in wild-type (RH) <i>T. gondii</i> a membranous network connects parasites at their posterior pole whereas no obvious connections between individual parasites were observed in the <i>act1</i> cKO (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In addition, imaging of extracellular parasites by SEM and immunofluorescence showed aberrant morphology at the posterior pole in the <i>act1</i> cKO parasites, which appears generally flattened (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, arrow). Together, these data suggest a role of actin in the formation of the RB, the organization of parasites within the PV and the intravacuolar network. Furthermore, asynchronous replication of parasites within the PV may indicate a loss of signalling between individual parasites."

To investigate this hypothesis and the role of actin in this process, we infected host cells with wt or <i>act1</i> cKO parasites expressing GFP and bleached individual parasites within the PV before measuring the time of fluorescence recovery (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). While the fluorescence signal recovered rapidly in wt parasites (~30 s), no fluorescence recovery could be observed in parasites depleted of actin, indicating a defect in material transfer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

However, F-actin has not previously been visualised in live parasites, complicating a functional characterisation of F-actin and F-actin dynamics in apicomplexan parasites. In order to visualize F-actin in <i>T. gondii,</i> we modified a commercially available actin-chromobody (Cb) that has been established as a novel tool to study F-actin dynamics in living cells. This single chain camel antibody specifically recognizes F-actin and has been successfully employed to study actin dynamics in diverse eukaryotes. We generated two expression vectors for Cb, where Cb is fused to either Emerald GFP (Cb-EmGFP; [<a href=\"#bib45\">Shaner et al., 2007</a>]) or Halo (Cb-Halo; [<a href=\"#bib30\">Los et al., 2008</a>]). Upon transient expression of these proteins, we obtained identical staining of filamentous structures within the parasites. Cb was also localised somewhat diffusely in the parasite cytosol, probably corresponding to unbound Cb in the cytosol as the protein was expressed at a high level (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Strikingly, individual parasites within the PV remain connected by a filamentous actin network which stretches throughout the RB and parasitophorous vacuole and can be seen to enter the posterior pole of individual parasites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, arrow). With increasing size of the parasitophorous vacuole, an impressive intravacuolar network consisting of F-actin became apparent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) that appeared to not only connect individual parasites, but also reached from the centre to the edge of the PV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, Figure 7)."

To ensure minimal influence of Cb expression on actin dynamics in our stable line, we also analysed gliding motility, an important process depending on F-actin dynamics (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dobrowolski and Sibley, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Drewry and Sibley, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jacot et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Opitz and Soldati, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Skillman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wetzel et al., 2003</a>). We found that the rate of overall motility is slightly increased (p&lt;0.05) upon expression of Cb (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), indicating an influence of Cb expression on actin dynamics. Intriguingly, average trajectory lengths are identical in wt and Cb expressing parasites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), while average gliding speed is reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). We also analysed average invasion speeds and confirmed that parasites penetrate the host cell within 30 s irrespective of Cb expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Furthermore, time lapse imaging of Cb-Emerald demonstrated a highly dynamic behaviour of F-actin within the cytosol (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Together these data demonstrate that, similar to the situation in other eukaryotes, the expression of this actin binding protein has no or modest effects on established actin-dependent processes in <i>T. gondii</i>. Moreover, as we identified little phenotypic consequence due to stable Cb expression in actin function, this reagent will be a useful tool for detecting parasite F-actin in live cells, and characterizing actin dynamics and organization."

Since apicomplexan actin cannot be functionally heterologously expressed (<a href=\"#bib37\">Olshina et al., 2016</a>), we used skeletal chicken actin to estimate the binding characteristics of Cb to F-actin. Recombinant Cb with a C-terminal 6-His tag (rCb) was expressed and purified from bacteria (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). rCb bound to chicken skeletal actin with <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of 5 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To confirm that Cb-Halo binds specifically to <i>Toxoplasma</i> F-actin when expressed in the parasite, we co-immunoprecipitated actin from extracellular parasites using an anti-Halo antibody (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). As expected, only a small proportion of actin was precipitated, which corresponds well with published data suggesting that only ~2% of total parasite actin can be found in its filamentous form in extracellular parasites (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dobrowolski and Sibley, 1997</a>). Importantly, mass-spectrometric analysis of the immunoprecipitation confirmed that Cb-Halo specifically precipitated parasite actin. Although additional, potential F-actin binding proteins were detected, no host cell actin, actin related or actin-like proteins could be identified (not shown). To assess if expression of Cb stabilises F-actin in parasites, we compared the amount of pelletable actin in parasites expressing Cb and wt parasites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). We confirmed that in both cases F-actin is barely detectable in extracellular parasites, indicating that it is primarily found in globular form. Treatment of parasites with Jas allowed detection of significant amount of F-actin in the pellet. Of note, no significant difference could be observed between control parasites and parasites expressing Cb. Together, these data confirm that expression of Cb in parasites allows detection of F-actin and that Cb expression has only minor effects on F-actin dynamics, as previously shown in other eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Panza et al., 2015</a>)."

Using actin-modulating drugs, the actin cytoskeleton was either depolymerized with Cytochalasin D (Cyt-D) or stabilized with Jasplakinolide (Jas). Treatment of intracellular parasites with Cyt-D led to the disintegration of the inter-parasite connections with only punctate spots remaining, which were also identified with anti-actin antibody (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In contrast, treatment with Jas led to the stabilisation of F-actin and intra-parasite connections were easily detectable with either Cb or an anti-actin antibody (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Using default settings of the Ridge Detector plugin (<a href=\"#bib51\">Steger, 1998</a>) we determined the apparent number, maximum length and average filament size of PVs treated with Jas, Cyt-D or untreated PVs (control) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> right panel). In Jas-treated PVs, and in contrast to Cyt-D treated PVs, there is an increase in average and maximum filament size, together with a decrease in total number of short filaments supporting the stabilisation and depolymerisation of Cb-Halo detected filaments in the presence of Jas and Cyt-D respectively. An intermediate situation occurs in untreated PVs with long filaments and high number of short filaments supporting a dynamic regulation in actin polymerisation in control samples. Overall, these results support that filaments detected with Cb-Halo behave as typical actin filaments in the presence of actin regulatory drugs. This supports the evidence that Cb-Halo is specifically labelling F-actin filaments and that Cb binding to actin does not prevent depolymerisation caused by Cyt-D."

Using these parasites, we found that as early as 24 hr after excision of the <i>act1</i> gene, the filamentous network collapsed, leaving punctate actin spots visible only in the RBs (similar to vacuoles treated with Cyt-D). By 48 hr onwards, no F-actin structures could be observed and Cb-Halo was completely cytosolic, as expected due to cytosolic expression of this reagent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The loss of filaments within the <i>act1</i> cKO over-time follows the down-regulation of ACT1 in <i>act1</i> cKO, indicating a polymerisation mechanism similar to eukaryotic actins (<a href=\"#bib54\">Whitelaw et al., 2017</a>). To exclude a role of host cell actin in the formation of the inter-parasite connections, we treated infected host cells with the actin-disrupting drug latrunculin A, which specifically inhibits polymerization of host cell, but not parasite, actin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hegge et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Whitelaw et al., 2017</a>). We found that latrunculin A treatment for 3 hr led to complete disruption of host cell F-actin (visualised using Phalloidin<sub>488</sub>), while the parasite F-actin network remained unaffected. This confirms that Cb-positive filamentous structures were not derived from host cell actin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Next we wished to compare F-actin dynamics in a conditional mutant for the actin depolymerisation factor (ADF; [<a href=\"#bib32\">Mehta and Sibley, 2011</a>]). Previous studies demonstrated that the knockdown of ADF leads to stabilisation of actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mehta and Sibley, 2011</a>) and apicoplast loss (<a href=\"#bib19\">Haase et al., 2015</a>). When we expressed Cb-Emerald in <i>adf</i> cKD to compare actin dynamics, we found that in absence of anhydrotetracycline (ATc) - when ADF is expressed - parasite F-actin shows a highly dynamic behaviour similar to wt parasites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, compare <a href=\"#media6\">Videos 6</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">7</a>). In stark contrast, incubation of parasites with ATc for 96 hr leads to depletion of ADF and consequently F-actin dynamics is significantly diminished. Under these conditions F-actin filaments accumulate at the posterior and to a lesser extent at the apical pole of the parasites. However, no dynamic behaviour can be detected and no filaments can be detected within the cytosol of the parasites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> (red arrows), <a href=\"#media6\">Videos 6</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">7</a>)."

Using time-lapse analysis, we found that in non-replicating parasites F-actin forms an extended, continuous filamentous network through the RB, connecting the parasites. During parasite replication, this network collapses and F-actin retreats to the RB (asterisks) before the network reform again, extending throughout the PV (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). Note that these filaments appear relatively static in resting parasites and do not show much reorientation/movement within 8 hr.

When we triggered a calcium signalling cascade using Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Ionophore (<a href=\"#bib8\">Black et al., 2000</a>), the F-actin network collapsed rapidly, between 10 and 60 s after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Ionophore addition (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). Collapse of the network preceded the initiation of motility and egress from the host cell (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, arrow head; <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>).

The network within a vacuole was imaged using 3D structural illumination super-resolution microscopy (3D-SIM) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Thin sections of the same network were then imaged with transmission electron microscopy (squares). This demonstrated that extracellular F-actin filaments reside within membranous tubules of 50\u201360 nm in diameter. Within these tubules, several\u00a0~5 nm thick filaments (arrows) extending over 100 nm in length were observed (highlighted in magenta). Taken together these results confirm the presence of bundles of actin filaments bound within a membranous network, which connects individual parasites within the PV. This situation appears very similar to the formation of tunnelling nanotubes, long filopodia like structures, which consists of thin F-actin-based membranous structures with a small diameter (20\u2013500 nm) that facilitate long range communications between cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abounit and Zurzolo, 2012</a>)."

Since then, polymerization kinetics of heterologously expressed apicomplexan actin showed that it polymerized in an unusual isodesmic process, in contrast to conventional eukaryotic actin (<a href=\"#bib49\">Skillman et al., 2013</a>). These findings have been recently questioned, as heterologously expressed apicomplexan actin was shown to be misfolded (<a href=\"#bib37\">Olshina et al., 2016</a>). In parallel, a number of recent genetic studies have demonstrated important functions of parasite actin during intracellular development, including maintenance of the apicoplast (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andenmatten et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Egarter et al., 2014</a>), daughter cell replication (<a href=\"#bib19\">Haase et al., 2015</a>) and motility of secretory organelles (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heaslip et al., 2016</a>). These findings cannot be easily reconciled with the current view of parasite actin being incapable of efficient polymerization, and would instead predict the presence of F-actin filaments within the parasite cytosol. Furthermore, there are 11 putative myosin motors within the parasite (<a href=\"#bib17\">Foth et al., 2006</a>), driving diverse cellular processes from cell division to motility, which require actin filaments to function."

                        "text": "A major impediment to resolving this controversy has been the lack of appropriate reagents for specifically labelling F-actin. Parasite actin does not bind phalloidin, the gold standard reagent in other eukaryotic systems (<a href=\"#bib48\">Skillman et al., 2011</a>) and, attempts to use genetically encoded actin sensors, such a LifeAct (<a href=\"#bib42\">Riedl et al., 2008</a>) or Utrophin-CH (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burkel et al., 2007</a>) have failed thus far (our and others unpublished data). Using a novel tool based on camelid nanobodies, Chromobody, we have visualized F-actin in <i>T. gondii</i> for the first time in live parasites and demonstrated it has important and previously unforeseen roles during the intracellular development of the parasite. While individual actin filament kinetics could not be easily defined, due to\u00a0their highly dynamic nature within the parasite cytosol (<a href=\"#media5\">Videos 5</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media7\">7</a>), a relatively stable F-actin network was clearly visible that linked individual parasites within the vacuole. Chromobodies have been used successfully in diverse eukaryotes to analyse actin dynamics (<a href=\"#bib40\">Panza et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Plessner et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rocchetti et al., 2014</a>) and appear to have less toxicity than other F-actin sensors. However, we were concerned that Cb expression in <i>T. gondii</i> would perturb actin polymerisation, especially given the proposed dynamic and unstable nature of <i>T. gondii</i> actin. Indeed, high levels of transiently expressed Cb inhibited dense granule motility, likely by stabilizing F-actin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). However, upon stable expression of Cb-Halo or Cb-Emerald, no effect on the actin-dependent processes of invasion, replication and egress were observed, while only small alterations in dense granule movement and parasite motility were detectable (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The reason for these discrepancies is currently unknown, but may be related to differing sensitivities of actin dynamics for these processes. Additionally, we demonstrated that the total amount of F-actin in the parasite does not change upon expression of Cb (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), indicating that while actin dynamics may be modulated, the overall polymerization state of actin does not change. We show that parasite actin remains susceptible to depolymerising and stabilizing agents Cyt-D and Jas. Moreover, the localization of Cb to filamentous structures in the residual body and inter-parasite network critically depends on the presence of actin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). These data confirm that genetically encoded Cb-Halo and Cb-Emerald does not significantly alter actin dynamics within the parasite and so is an appropriate and robust tool for examining F-actin in this system."

When actin filaments were stabilised by the presence of Jas (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) this stain becomes more prominent and this was not dependent on the expression of Cb. This suggests that F-actin is less accessible to exogenously added antibodies after fixation, perhaps due to epitope alterations during fixation or the association of actin binding proteins to filaments. Interestingly, while actin has never been previously associated with this membranous network in <i>T. gondii</i>, it appears very similar to structures recently described for the related parasite <i>Theileria annulata</i>, which was shown to contain F-actin in a similar configuration (<a href=\"#bib29\">K\u00fchni-Boghenbor et al., 2012</a>)."

Defining the organization of cytosolic filaments will be critical to further elucidating the role of F-actin both during intracellular processes such as vesicle transport and extracellular processes such as motility and invasion, where the role of the parasites acto-myosin system is currently readdressed, since parasites devoid of detectable actin remain invasive (<a href=\"#bib54\">Whitelaw et al., 2017</a>). Interestingly, it appears that host cell membrane dynamics, driven by host cell actin, appears to be modulated by the parasite, enabling invasion in the absence of a functional parasite acto-myosin system (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bichet et al., 2016</a>)."

The authors use an actin probe based on camelid antibodies (chromobody, Cb) to trace endogenous actin during intracellular life cycle. This approach has already proved successful in monitoring actin dynamics in various systems ranging from mammalian cell lines to the whole zebrafish. This approach is highly relevant in the context of <i>Toxoplasma</i> and related parasites, since the understanding of actin dynamics (i.e. assembly/disassembly/2D and 3D organization) remains quite elusive in this organism and the processes of formation and turnover of polymerized actin pool are subject of controversy. Use of a chromobody helps to avoid the drawbacks of direct tagging or overexpression. This study clearly brings novelty to the field but also challenges the existing data in particular concerning the amount of F-actin, localization and network architecture in <i>Toxoplasma</i>. While the authors do not yet provide mechanistic explanations on how a particular F-actin bundle-like network that spreads in the vacuolar space, could nucleate, maintain the polarity of the progeny within the vacuole and possibly assist daughter cell individualisation, the first identification of this actin-based population provides a new angle for future dissection of the features of actin dynamics during <i>Toxoplasma</i> replication and possibly for uncovering additional F-actin sub-populations of distinct dynamics."
