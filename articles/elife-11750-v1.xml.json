Here we elucidate the basic rules of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> thermotaxis and test the function of candidate thermoreceptors in this important behavior. We show that host-seeking mosquitoes are maximally attracted to thermal stimuli approximating host body temperatures, seeking relative warmth while avoiding both relative cool and stimuli exceeding host body temperature. We found that the cation channel <i>TRPA1,</i> in addition to playing a conserved role in thermoregulation and chemosensation, is required for this specialized host-selective thermotaxis in mosquitoes. During host-seeking, <i>AaegTRPA1<sup>-/-</sup> </i>mutants failed to avoid stimuli exceeding host temperature, and were unable to discriminate between host-temperature and high-temperature stimuli. <i>TRPA1</i>-dependent tuning of thermotaxis is likely critical for mosquitoes host-seeking in a complex thermal environment in which humans are warmer than ambient air, but cooler than surrounding sun-warmed surfaces."

This type of sensory navigation allows animals to avoid environments of noxious cold and heat, with the goal of remaining in physiologically suitable ambient temperatures. For ectotherms, such as most insects, thermotaxis behavior is the primary method of thermoregulation. Terrestrial invertebrates are vulnerable to temperature extremes, facing the risk of desiccation at elevated temperatures, and rapid hypothermia at low temperatures. Therefore, mechanisms to detect environmental temperatures and trigger appropriate approach or avoidance behaviors are extremely important for their survival. For instance, adult <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> worms migrate preferentially toward a specific thermal environment determined by the temperature of their cultivation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hedgecock and Russell, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mori and Ohshima, 1995</a>).

Mosquitoes use a variety of physical and chemical senses to locate hosts in their environment (<a href=\"#bib5\">Card\u00e9, 2015</a>). When host-seeking, these animals become strongly attracted to inanimate warm objects, eagerly probing at them as if they were hosts (<a href=\"#bib18\">Howlett, 1910</a>)."

Thermotaxis is typically initiated by thermosensitive neurons that sample environmental temperature to inform navigational decision-making. Such neurons must be equipped with molecular thermosensors capable of detecting and transducing thermal stimuli. Diverse molecular thermoreceptors have been identified in the animal kingdom, many of which are members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of ion channels (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barbagallo and Garrity, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Palkar et al., 2015</a>). Different thermosensitive TRPs show distinct tuning spanning the thermal spectrum from noxious cold to noxious heat. Among these is TRPA1, which is a heat sensor in multiple insects, including the vinegar fly <i>D. melanogaster</i> and the malaria mosquito <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hamada et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). Neurons in thermosensitive sensilla (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gingl et al., 2005</a>) of <i>An. gambiae</i> female antennae express <i>TRPA1</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). In <i>D. melanogaster, TRPA1</i> is expressed in internal thermosensors located in the brain, and <i>DmelTRPA1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutants fail to avoid high air temperature in a thermal gradient (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hamada et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, some snakes and vampire bats express thermosensitive TRP channels in organs used to sense infrared radiation from warm-blooded prey (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gracheva et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">2011</a>). This raises the possibility that <i>AaegTRPA1</i> may be used by mosquitoes to find hosts. Recently, a structurally distinct insect thermosensor, <i>Gr28b,</i> was identified in <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ni et al., 2013</a>). <i>Gr28b</i>, a gustatory receptor paralog, is expressed in heat-sensitive neurons of <i>D. melanogaster</i> aristae and is an important component of thermotaxis during rapid avoidance of heat (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ni et al., 2013</a>). It is also highly conserved among <i>Drosophila</i> species (<a href=\"#bib30\">McBride et al., 2007</a>), and has a clear ortholog in <i>Ae. aegypti, AaegGr19</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ni et al., 2013</a>). A functional role for these thermosensors has never been investigated in the mosquito."

Our results show that by seeking relative warmth and avoiding both relative cool and high temperatures, female mosquitoes selectively localized to thermal stimuli that approximate warm-blooded hosts. Using genome editing, we generated mutations in the candidate thermoreceptors, <i>AaegTRPA1</i> and <i>AaegGr19</i>. We found that <i>TRPA1</i> is required for tuning mosquito thermotaxis during host-seeking. <i>AaegTRPA1<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>mutants lacked normal avoidance of thermal stimuli exceeding host body temperatures, resulting in a loss of preference for biologically\u00a0relevant thermal stimuli that resemble hosts. This work is important because it identifies a key mechanism by which mosquitoes tune their thermosensory systems toward human body temperatures."

This assay has the advantages that it is simple in design, produces robust behaviors, and enables the collection of data from large numbers of animals in a short experimental timeframe. Using this system, we can examine mosquito responses to diverse thermal stimuli and measure thermotaxis in different ambient temperature environments. We first needed to determine whether heat-seeking behavior habituates over multiple thermal stimulations. In our heat-seeking assay, <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes reliably responded to 12 serial presentations of a 3-minute long 40\u00b0C stimulus over the course of more than 2.5\u2009hr, with no evidence of habituation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We found that mosquitoes were highly sensitive to thermal contrast and were attracted to stimuli 2.5\u00b0C above ambient (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). Furthermore, mosquito occupancy on the Peltier increased monotonically\u00a0with stimulus temperatures up to 40\u00b0C. However, for higher\u00a0temperature stimuli, we observed a dramatic reduction in Peltier occupancy. A 50\u00b0C stimulus resulted in approximately half as many animals on the Peltier compared to a 40\u00b0C stimulus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>).

Using a quantitative thermotaxis assay, we modelled <i>Ae. aegypti</i> heat-seeking behavior in the laboratory. We found that mosquitoes can search for hosts in a wide range of ambient temperatures by seeking relative warmth and avoiding relative cool. Remarkably, these animals can detect a stimulus with thermal contrast as small as 2.5\u00b0C. In an outdoor environment, however, hosts are often warmer than the surrounding air but cooler than sun-warmed soil, rocks, trees, and human-made objects (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). For this reason, diurnal mosquitoes such as <i>Ae. aegypti</i> are poorly served by merely thermotaxing to the hottest object available. A more optimal strategy is to search specifically for biologically relevant stimuli, and to avoid thermal stimuli exceeding host temperature, as we have observed in our laboratory models of heat-seeking. Acquiring a blood meal is an essential component of reproduction for a female <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquito. To maximize her chances of success, a female mosquito should reject \u2018distracting\u2019 stimuli that exceed host temperatures. Our results demonstrate that <i>AaegTRPA1</i> is critical for this selective thermotaxis."

Until now, mechanistic studies of thermosensation have been largely restricted to traditional laboratory model organisms, such as domestic mice and <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> flies, whose thermotaxis consists mainly of moving away from suboptimal thermal environments. Mosquitoes too, must undergo such behavioral thermoregulation, as we have found in our thermal gradient assay. However, their repertoire of thermotactic behaviors is expanded by the evolution of a specialized and highly tuned mode of thermotaxis to locate warm-blooded hosts. It may also be that these two thermotactic drives\u2014host-seeking and thermoregulation\u2014interact in mosquitoes. For instance, the avoidance of high-temperature stimuli during heat-seeking may be influenced by a nociceptive or thermoregulatory response independent of host-seeking behavior. It will be interesting to investigate the neural mechanisms that regulate divergent behavioral choices of thermoregulation and heat-seeking, and whether these systems are in behavioral conflict during mosquito host-seeking."

                        "text": "Our work identifies <i>TRPA1</i> as a gene regulating mosquito avoidance of high-temperature stimuli, which we have shown to be a major behavioral component of heat-seeking. However, because both <i>AaegTRPA1<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>AaegGr19<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>mutants retain normal attraction to warmth, this aspect of heat-seeking must rely on other thermoreceptors, still to be identified. Our study shows that this attraction must be mediated either by a single thermosensor that adapts to background temperature, or multiple thermosensors each tuned to a distinct absolute threshold. During interactions with a warm-blooded host or a 50\u00b0C Peltier, mosquitoes are likely experiencing a wide range of thermal fluctuations. For instance, there can be a 10\u00b0C thermal gradient in the air within 5 mm of a 37\u00b0C stimulus or human arm (<a href=\"#bib40\">van Breugel et al., 2015</a>). This suggests that for a mosquito standing on a warmed Peltier, the antennae, brain, thorax, forelegs, and proboscis may all be experiencing different temperatures. The temperature of mosquito tissues will also be greatly influenced by their material and geometric properties, as well as thermal conduction due to contact with the Peltier. Furthermore, convective plumes forming in the air near a vertical heated plate can be highly dynamic and turbulent in their structure, with thermal air gradients differing considerably at the bottom and top of the plate (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bejan, 2013</a>). These features of thermal stimuli may explain why mosquitoes in our assay often appear to be differentially attracted to the bottom and top of the Peltier. Future studies characterizing this complex thermal microenvironment, and identifying the relevant thermosensory neurons and receptors will be required to define the thermal fluctuations experienced by mosquitoes during heat-seeking. Understanding the behavioral and molecular basis of thermotaxis in mosquitoes and other disease vectors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Flores and Lazzari, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Schmitz et al., 2000</a>) is of great biomedical importance. <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes are potent vectors of yellow fever, chikungunya, and dengue arboviruses, resulting annually in hundreds of millions of infections (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhatt et al., 2013</a>). Further study of mosquito heat-seeking behavior may aid in the design of next-generation traps, repellents, and control strategies."

For each trial, 45\u201350 mosquitoes were introduced into a custom-made Plexiglas box (38.5 \u00d7 28 \u00d7 12.5 cm) with two Peltier elements (4.6 \u00d7 6.5 cm surface area, ATP-O40-12, Custom Thermoelectric, Bishopville, MD) each covered with a taut piece of standard white letter size printer paper (extra bright, Navigator) cut to 9 \u00d7 11\u00a0cm. The Peltier elements were mounted on a single wall, 3.5 cm above the floor, 8.5 cm from either edge of the enclosure, and adjacent to one another separated by 6.5 cm. Mosquitoes were allowed to acclimate for 10 min, at which point the Peltier elements were both warmed to 40\u00b0C. After fully warming the Peltier elements for 60 s, a CO<sub>2</sub> pulse (20 s) was added to the airstream and the Peltier elements were kept at 40\u00b0C for a 4-min stimulus period at which point they were returned to ambient temperature (26\u00b0C). After a 12-min interstimulus period, the stimulus was repeated, this time with the left Peltier element warmed to 50\u00b0C while the right Peltier element was warmed to 40\u00b0C. A camera (Point Grey Research, Richmond, BC, Canada) was used to measure mosquito landings, and only mosquitoes directly on either Peltier area during seconds 60\u2013240 of stimulus periods were scored. Preference was calculated by subtracting the proportion of total mosquitoes on the left Peltier (40 or 50\u00b0C) from the proportion of total mosquitoes on the right Peltier (40\u00b0C). Heat maps are smoothed 2D histograms of mean mosquito occupancy during seconds 60\u2013240 of stimulus periods, sampled at 1\u2009Hz and binned into 15 \u00d7 52 image sectors."

Capillaries spaced ~0.5 cm apart traversed the cotton plug (#49\u2013101, Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA) of the vial and protruded into the vial &lt; 1 mm to provide a flush surface for mosquitoes to access the liquid while resting on the plug surface. The control capillary contained only green sucrose solution, and the experimental capillary contained green sucrose solution supplemented with 0, 1, or 10 mM of denatonium benzoate (Sigma-Aldrich) or 0, 10, 50, or 100 mM of N-methylmaleimide (Sigma-Aldrich). The experimental capillary with 0 mM chemical was identical to the control capillary, and served as a zero-choice to test for side-bias in the assay. Because a small amount of liquid evaporated during preparation of the capillaries, all choice conditions and genotypes were prepared in a time-staggered format so that any measurement error due to evaporation was spread across the conditions. The levels of remaining liquid in both capillaries were measured after 18\u201320\u2009hr and were compared to the known initial liquid level. Experiments started at ZT 8\u201310 and ended at ZT 4\u20136 the following day. Consumption values were compared to control capillaries in vials without mosquitoes to account for evaporation. We note that in cases where mosquitoes did not feed from a capillary and all liquid loss was due to evaporation, consumption values could be calculated to be negative due to very small variation in evaporation rates between experimental and control capillaries. Any negative consumption values were rounded to zero. Sucrose preference was calculated by dividing the amount consumed from the control capillary (not containing denatonium benzoate or N-methylmaleimide) by the total amount consumed from both capillaries. In experiments with 0 mM denatonium benzoate or 0 mM N-methylmaleimide, one capillary was arbitrarily designated \u2018sucrose only\u2019."

A custom-built enclosure (6 mm tall) was affixed to an aluminum thermal gradient bar (50 \u00d7 30.5 cm, TGB-5030, ThermoElectric Cooling America Corp., Chicago, IL) driven by two Peltier elements (AHP-1200CPV, ThermoElectric Cooling America Corp., Chicago, IL). The enclosure was separated lengthwise into 4 lanes (each 50 \u00d7 6 cm) that were visually isolated from one another. Three lanes were for testing mosquito thermal preference, while the fourth lane was dedicated to measuring air temperature via an array of eight digital temperature sensors (DS18B20, Maxim, San Jose, CA; connected to an Arduino Uno, <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/\">https://www.arduino.cc/</a>) mounted to the top of the enclosure and distributed evenly across the length of the lane and centered in each analysis sector. An overhead camera (C910, Logitech, Lausanne, Switzerland) monitored mosquito position through the transparent lid of the enclosure. Images were acquired once per minute and analyzed using custom MATLAB scripts to count mosquitoes across eight analysis sectors of the lane. The MATLAB script\u00a0is available for download\u00a0as\u00a0<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Source code 3</a>. The assay was conducted in a room maintained at 80\u201390% relative humidity and 14\u00b0C to achieve low air temperatures within the gradient enclosure. At the beginning of each 3-hr trial, the air temperature throughout the enclosure was stabilized at ~26\u00b0C, and 25\u201330 mosquitoes were introduced into each lane of the assay. After 90 min, a thermal gradient was established (air temperatures: ~19\u00b0C to ~36\u00b0C) by heating the right Peltier element and cooling the left Peltier element. Mosquitoes were monitored for an additional 90 min while exposed to this thermal gradient. Mosquito distributions during minutes 60\u201390 were monitored in both the \u2018no thermal gradient\u2019 and \u2018thermal gradient\u2019 conditions. Dead mosquitoes were visually identified at the conclusion of each trial. All genotypes were tested in parallel, and their lane positions were randomized across trials."

The authors established a behavioral assay to test thermal preference and determined the range of temperatures that female mosquitoes find attractive. They then generated targeted mutations in TRPA1 and Gr19, previously shown to participate in <i>Drosophila</i> thermosensation, and examined their role in thermal preference. This is an important study because thermotaxis behaviors in mosquitoes have not yet been studied in depth (and quantitatively), and because the authors link a particular thermoreceptor to heat avoidance using genetic knockouts. The behavioral assays are quite nice and the analysis of mutant mosquitos impressive."

If the temp of the Peltier plate is uneven, then measuring the temp gradient across the plate could help the authors to better define the temp preference range for the mosquitoes. Alternatively, it might be possible to determine occupancy only in the central region of the Peltier, where the temperature is uniform."

These plots indicate that in all cases (even at higher temperatures &gt;45C) mosquitoes first land on the warm object and then leave it if it is too hot, or persist if it is around 40C. This implies that the \"seeking\" part of the behavior might only depend on detecting warm objects, and that the 90-180 second time window used for all quantifications in the paper comprises a combination of temperature seeking + heat avoidance behaviors. The <i>TrpA1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mosquitoes seem to be defective in the heat avoidance behavior not the seeking behavior. These results/interpretations should be discussed in the text."

We absolutely agree that it would be valuable to know more about the temperature that mosquitoes experience in this assay. This is a very difficult measurement to obtain and interpret, because thermal stimuli by their nature produce extremely complex and non-uniform thermal microenvironments. Moreover, to our knowledge there is no way to determine the instantaneous temperature that thermosensitive neurons in the mosquito sensory structures are experiencing. We could restrict our analysis to only report occupancy in the center of the Peltier, as was suggested, but we would still be unable to claim that these animals are experiencing uniform temperatures. We erred on the side of showing all the data because the behavior of the mosquitoes is likely driven by heat produced from the full surface area of the Peltier. To bring these ideas into the manuscript, we have added the following text to the Discussion:"
