Some hemagglutinin-specific antibodies recognize many strains of influenza, but individuals do not produce enough of these antibodies to prevent infections with new strains. A basic understanding of what drives the production of different types of antibodies is important to devise vaccines that produce broadly effective antibodies for flu and for other viruses and pathogens that have proven to be difficult vaccine targets."

Despite this, Altman et al. found that the antibody response of mice and lampreys to flu is remarkably similar. Of several potential viral targets, antibodies from both mice and lampreys were predominantly directed against the hemagglutinin. Of numerous potential locations on the hemagglutinin, mouse and lamprey antibodies predominantly recognized the same region."

Originally defined as a functional principle (e.g., ability to protect animals against injection with a toxin), the responsible substance was termed an antibody (Ab), which we now know to consist of immunoglobulins (Igs) in jawed vertebrates. After more than a century of steady progress, a basic molecular understanding of Ig function is at hand (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ramaraj et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Georgiou et al., 2014</a>); surprisingly little is known, however, regarding the basic rules of immunogenicity. In responding to viruses, why are some proteins more immunogenic than others? Why do Ig responses focus on certain regions of proteins? To what extent is this due to the specific features of Ig structure and combining site chemistry or repertoire limitations imposed by self-tolerance?"

IAV is composed of four major structural proteins: two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), embedded in a lipid envelope, lined by the matrix protein (M1), which encases the nucleoprotein (NP) coated viral genome. Due to its importance as the target of protective Igs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Couch and Kasel, 1983</a>), HA is probably the most intensively characterized immunogen/antigen. Most HA-specific Igs with virus neutralizing activity bind to or bridge 5 antigenic regions in the globular domain (termed Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2, and Cb), which surround the sialic acid receptor site that attaches HA to host cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gerhard et al., 1981</a>). Variation in these sites as IAV evolves in the human population (\u2018antigenic drift\u2019) prevents effective IAV vaccination, necessitating frequent changes in vaccine formulation. The recent discovery that humans can generate protective Igs to conserved structures in the membrane-proximal HA stem have raised hopes of more effective vaccination if stem responses can be augmented using appropriately designed vaccines (<a href=\"#bib17\">Laursen and Wilson, 2013</a>). Better understanding the rules of immunogenicity could inform these critical efforts."

Cyclostomes branched evolutionarily from jawed vertebrates approximately 550 million years ago (Mya) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Pioneering studies from the Good laboratory established that lampreys generate Ab responses to protein and carbohydrate immunogens (<a href=\"#bib9\">Finstad and Good, 1964</a>). More than 40 years later, Cooper and colleagues discovered that lamprey Abs, VLRBs, bear no relationship to Igs, but rather are structurally similar to Toll-like receptors (<a href=\"#bib24\">Pancer et al., 2004</a>). In place of RAG-mediated V(D)J recombination, VLRB diversity is generated using a gene assembly mechanism reminiscent of the activation-induced cytidine deamine-catalyzed gene conversion mechanism used to diversify <i>Ig</i> genes in birds and some mammals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Genetically isolating HA from NA using the J1 (H3N1, PR8 internal proteins) and P50 (H1N2, HK internal proteins) reassortants shows that upwards of 80% of ELISA-detected Abs are specific for HA in lamprey and mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Low binding to X31 and HK soluble proteins, which contain significant amounts of M1 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicate that M1 is negligibly immunogenic (note that internal viral proteins from H3 and H1 viruses are antigenically highly conserved).

To compare Ig and VLRB footprints, we competed lamprey plasma against mouse monoclonal Abs (mAbs) specific for defined HA antigenic sites for binding to PR8-coated ELISA wells. Although IAV immunization elicited VLRB responses in all lampreys tested, we selected lampreys with the highest titers for the competition experiments because these experiments require larger amounts of VLRB. Comparing the relative titers of inhibitory activity provides an approximate measure of binding proximity. Such competition assays are complicated by steric hindrance between Abs binding physically adjacent epitopes as well as more subtle positive and negative conformational effects that occur upon Ig binding to HA (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lubeck and Gerhard, 1982</a>)."

Also, while both L7 and L9 have a similar ELISA titer to whole virus, L9 plasma competes with mAbs specific for each of the five sites, but L7 fails to compete with Sa and Sb mAbs. This demonstrates that VLRB binding to the HA head does not uniformly block binding of all head-specific Igs and, importantly, indicates that fine antigen specificity varies among individual lampreys. We also infer this from the different titers observed against the various mAbs, an effect that is unlikely to be based on mAb affinity, since VLRBs are allowed to bind to HA prior to mAb addition."

Although steric issues limit interpretation of the competition experiments, the common effect of amino acid substitution on VLRB and Ig binding argues strongly for convergent recognition of highly overlapping epitopes. Equally surprising is the similarity of the overall immunodominance profile of IAV immunogens in mammals and lamprey responding to inactivated intact virus: the HA globular domain is favored over the stem; HA is favored over NA; and internal proteins, despite their relative abundance in the virion, are weakly (NP) or undetectably (M1) immunogenic."

Total Ig can also increase in jawed fish after immunization (<a href=\"#bib3\">Castro et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Xu et al., 2013</a>). This differs from mammals, where high levels are maintained constitutively. The ability of lampreys to respond to purified IAV without additional adjuvant indicates that lampreys recognize viral RNA or other viral innate immune activating molecules. We also show in competition assays that individual lampreys mount VLRB responses against different antigenic sites. Whether this is due to genetic, environmental, or stochastic factors is a question for further study. It is well worth noting that there is little information regarding how individuals among outbred groups vary in their Ig response to viruses or other complex antigens."

When only the antigen <i>contacting</i> residue frequency is quantified, the amino acids are biased towards Tyr, Trp, Asn, and Asp residues (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

For neutralization, we cultured MDCK cells (350k) in 24-well plates overnight. The next day we added PR8 at a MOI of 0.07 in the presence of either H17-L2 (anti HA mAb) or control 1.2F4 against influenza B, or lamprey plasma, animal L9 vs na\u00efve plasma diluted in 0.1% BSS/BSA. After 1 hr incubation, we removed the supernatant and replaced with complete media. After 7 more hours, we trypsinized cells, fixed and permeabilized cells with FoxP3 Buffer and stained with anti-HA and anti-NP mAbs, then analyzed cells with a LSR II flow cytometer. Single cells positive for either HA or NP by flow cytometry were considered infected. Data were fitted to a variable dose-response curve and the best-fit infectious dose 50 (ID50) calculated using PRISM software."

Are there lamprey VLRBs against the vRNPs and no IgG against vRNPs in the mouse serum? This could be tested using cells transfected with polymerase expression plasmids. Alternatively, NP-specific antibody or VLRB responses may depend more on antigen processing and presentation of NP in the virion than HA and NA specific responses. How similar are these processes in lamprey and mice? This possibility could be mentioned in the Discussion."

Although phrased \u201cligand-contacting\u201d in by Velikovsky et al., the analysis was based on total variable-position residues rather than predicting residues that actually contact antigen based on crystal structure data. The distinction is subtle yet significant, because only roughly one-half (VLRB.2D, 11 of 20; VLR4, 11 of 20) to one-third (RBC36, 11 of 28; aGPA.23, 9 of 28) of the residues in the variable positions actually contact antigen in the available structures. For instance, Asp is the most frequent \u201cligand-contacting\u201d residue in VLRB.2D, occupying 5 of 20 total positions, yet only two Asp residues actually contact HEL making it fourth most frequent in our analysis (Velikovsky et al., <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, red circles above entropy bars)."

The Methods section has been modified to include the aquaculture conditions and temperature information. Since the VLR responses are comparable at the two aquaculture temperatures we have tested, we do not believe that this will add to the Discussion."

However, both mouse serum and lamprey larvae bound to virions cores in Elisa. This virion core is composed of NP and likely the vRNPs. Are there lamprey VLRBs against the vRNPs and no IgG against vRNPs in the mouse serum? This could be tested using cells transfected with polymerase expression plasmids. Alternatively, NP-specific antibody or VLRB responses may depend more on antigen processing and presentation of NP in the virion than HA and NA specific responses. How similar are these processes in lamprey and mice? This possibility could be mentioned in the Discussion</i>."

To directly address this discrepancy and address the reviewers concerns, we obtained NP generously provided by Yizhe Jane Tao\u2019s lab at Rice University that was sufficiently pure for use in x-ray crystallography studies. In contrast to the flow assay, both immune mouse sera and lamprey plasma bound purified NP by ELISA, clearly demonstrating that lamprey, like mice, respond to NP. These anti-NP VLRBs are likely to account for most of the binding to flu core antigens. As predicted by the reviewers, the lack of VLRB binding to NP expressing cells in the flow assay most likely has a technical explanation."
