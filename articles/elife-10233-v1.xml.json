First, they either eliminated the expression of all gamma-protocadherins, or allowed the expression of only a single working isoform. In the absence of all gamma-protocadherins, individual SACs began to form synapses with themselves, and formed fewer synapses with neighboring SACs than those in wild type retinas. Furthermore, Kostandinov and Sanes discovered that while many of the synapses that form between SACs are actually eliminated during the normal development of the retina, this loss is reduced if gamma-protocadherins are missing. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the retinal circuitry failed to work properly because of the anatomical changes caused by the elimination of the gamma-protocadherins."

However, in this case, individual cells still exhibited self-avoidance and formed branched nerve endings. However, self/nonself discrimination was perturbed, which adversely affected the connections with neighboring SACs. As such, the loss of all gamma-protocadherins had a slightly different effect compared to the loss of all but one gamma-protocadherin. This likely reflects the fact that SACs with a single gamma-protocadherin look more like wild type cells than cells with none."

Therefore, the differences in direction selectivity reflect problems within the SAC network itself. Thus, these findings offer a clear and comprehensive characterization of the consequences of losing self-avoidance and self/nonself discrimination, in terms of both how the SACs connect with other cells, and how this affects the way in which they operate."

First, how many cell types use gamma-protocadherins in this way? It has been suggested that cerebellar Purkinje cells might do so too (<a href=\"#bib3\">Lefebvre et al., 2012</a>), but both SACs and Purkinje cells are rather specialized cells and may not represent a typical neuron. Furthermore, several other proteins can act as cues to promote self-avoidance and control the shaping of neural circuits (<a href=\"#bib1\">Fuerst et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Matsuoka et al., 2012</a>); could these molecules also be involved and could the same molecules have different roles in specific cell types? Finally, how do \u2018adhesion molecules\u2019 recognize each other in a way that, depending on the context, sometimes results in avoidance and not adhesion (<a href=\"#bib7\">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Schreiner and Weiner, 2010</a>)? These and other questions have now become all the more important for understanding how the formation of neural circuits is optimized."
