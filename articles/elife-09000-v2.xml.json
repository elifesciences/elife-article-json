Classic studies propose that templates are encoded in sustained activity of sensory neurons. However, stimulus encoding is itself dynamic, tracing a complex trajectory through activity space. Which part of this trajectory is pre-activated to reflect the template? Here we recorded magneto- and electroencephalography during a visual target-detection task, and used pattern analyses to decode template, stimulus, and decision-variable representation. Our findings ran counter to the dominant model of sustained pre-activation. Instead, template information emerged transiently around stimulus onset and quickly subsided. Cross-generalization between stimulus and template coding, indicating a shared neural representation, occurred only briefly. Our results are compatible with the proposal that template representation relies on a matched filter, transforming input into task-appropriate output. This proposal was consistent with a signed difference response at the perceptual decision stage, which can be explained by a simple neural model."

Classic studies propose that templates are encoded in sustained activity of sensory neurons. However, stimulus encoding is itself dynamic, tracing a complex trajectory through activity space. Which part of this trajectory is pre-activated to reflect the template? Here we recorded magneto- and electroencephalography during a visual target-detection task, and used pattern analyses to decode template, stimulus, and decision-variable representation. Our findings ran counter to the dominant model of sustained pre-activation. Instead, template information emerged transiently around stimulus onset and quickly subsided. Cross-generalization between stimulus and template coding, indicating a shared neural representation, occurred only briefly. Our results are compatible with the proposal that template representation relies on a matched filter, transforming input into task-appropriate output. This proposal was consistent with a signed difference response at the perceptual decision stage, which can be explained by a simple neural model."

How the brain represents an internal template of the target of your search (the keys, in this example) has been a much-debated topic in neuroscience for the past 30 years. Previous research has indicated that neurons specialized for detecting the sought-after object when it is in view are also pre-activated when we are seeking it. This would mean that these \u2018template\u2019 neurons are active the entire time that we are searching."

When decisions are based on perceptual analysis, task goals influence behaviour by creating an internal template: incoming sensory information is then matched against it. The representation of templates therefore plays a fundamental role in guiding perception and decision-making. Biased competition (<a href=\"#bib21\">Desimone and Duncan, 1995</a>) provides a broad framework for how the brain interprets new sensory information in light of the current search template. A central tenet is that attention tonically pre-activates visual cortical neurons with receptive fields for relevant, template-matching stimuli (<a href=\"#bib66\">Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chelazzi et al., 2011</a>). Single-cell neurophysiology (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chelazzi et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Luck et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chelazzi et al., 1998</a>) and human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chawla et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kastner and Ungerleider, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Silver et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kastner et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Reddy et al., 2009</a>) have demonstrated that template representation and stimulus processing can occur in overlapping neural populations in the\u00a0visual cortex. Moreover, stimulus and template activity patterns cross-generalize (when measured with fMRI, <a href=\"#bib76\">Stokes et al., 2009</a>), implying that the two share a common neural code. In the simplest case, increasing baseline activity of a stimulus-specific representation could boost target processing (<a href=\"#bib82\">Sylvester et al., 2009</a>). This boost could facilitate target selection and reduce distractor competition for downstream processing resources (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bundesen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Maunsell and Treue, 2006</a>)."

Population-level analyses of time-resolved neural recordings show that stimulus decoding is highly time-specific (<a href=\"#bib37\">King and Dehaene, 2014</a>), with discriminative activity patterns changing at the millisecond scale. Such dynamic coding has been observed at the level of population spiking patterns within individual brain areas (<a href=\"#bib52\">Meyers et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Crowe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Stokes et al., 2013</a>), and at the level of distributed activation patterns across the cortex (<a href=\"#bib38\">King et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cichy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Wolff et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that this temporal dimension is an inherent aspect of neural coding (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buonomano and Maass, 2009</a>). Importantly, neural populations in visual (<a href=\"#bib52\">Meyers et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Sreenivasan et al., 2014</a>) and prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hussar and Pasternak, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Stokes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Astrand et al., 2015</a>) appear to represent a memorized stimulus with an independent pattern from that used during initial encoding. As a consequence, it is necessary to distinguish between a neural <i>pattern</i> (which may vary from moment to moment), and the <i>representational content</i> that is encoded in that pattern (which may be stable even when the pattern changes over time, see <a href=\"#bib31\">Haxby et al., 2014</a>)."

These tasks typically require judgments to be made at varying levels of perceptual difficulty (<a href=\"#bib86\">Vogels and Orban, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ghose et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Purushothaman and Bradley, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Summerfield and Koechlin, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Scolari and Serences, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Wyart et al, 2012</a>). The majority of perceptual decision-making studies have kept the decision boundary (or template) constant over the entire experiment, impeding a clear evaluation of the representation of templates as distinct from stimulus representation and from the sensory-to-template comparison. In the present study, we varied template and stimulus values independently, enabling us to examine the extent to which their coding and their temporal profiles overlap. We used pattern analysis of simultaneously recorded magneto- (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) to track visual template matching with high temporal resolution as human observers performed a parametric match-to-template orientation task (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

This approach transforms sensor-level responses into responses of virtual stimulus orientation channels: if a stimulus orientation is reflected in the MEG/EEG signal, virtual channel responses should peak at the corresponding orientation. In order to calculate the transformation of sensor data to tuning curves, the data were split into training and test sets. The training data were used to calculate each sensor\u2019s sensitivity to each stimulus orientation, yielding a weight matrix. This weight matrix was then multiplied with the data in the independent test set and averaged over sensors.

The basic decoding analysis already implies that dynamic neural patterns contain stable information: the same basis set is used for decoding throughout the epoch. Therefore, significant decoding along the time-specific diagonal axis in the cross-temporal analysis suggests that stimulus orientation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), or angular difference (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), is represented throughout significant changes in the underlying neural patterns. However, a more formal test of the representational structure of multivariate activity is provided by representational similarity analysis (RSA; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</a>). Rather than testing for discrimination per se, this approach focuses on the second-order pattern of condition-specific differences. This allows us to characterise the representational structure of the population code independently of the specific neural patterns associated with different stimulus orientations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kriegeskorte and Kievit, 2013</a>). As an example, a 40\u00ba-tilted stimulus might elicit a topography shortly after onset that is more similar to the topography from a 30\u00ba-stimulus than that of a 90\u00ba-stimulus. While the MEG patterns separating these stimuli might change throughout the trial, the relative difference between them could be preserved. This would indicate that the same kind of information about the stimuli is represented. This approach has been developed specifically to characterize implementation-independent representational geometry (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kriegeskorte and Kievit, 2013</a>), and therefore is well-suited here to test whether dynamic neural patterns essentially code the same information."

Given the simplicity of the stimulus set, a straightforward representational structure comes to mind: more similar stimulus (or template) orientations evoke more similar MEG topographies. However, this cannot be deduced from the population tuning-curve analysis alone. To evaluate the possibility, we calculated neural dissimilarity matrices between the mean responses evoked by each of the 16 stimulus orientations, and projected this 16\u00d716 neural dissimilarity matrix into two dimensions for visualization (using multi-dimensional scaling, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). During the stimulus-encoding period (50\u2013250 ms after stimulus onset), conditions fell onto a well-ordered circle: topographies were more similar (had a smaller Mahalanobis distance) if they were evoked by more similar stimulus orientations. This geometry was not present in the data before the onset of stimulus processing (\u201350 to +50 ms relative to stimulus onset, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). We tested for the temporal stability of this representational structure by correlating the data-derived (Mahalanobis) distance matrix at each time\u00a0point with an idealized distance matrix, derived from the angular distances of the respective stimulus orientations (i.e. a 16-point simplex, corresponding to the pairwise angular distances between all 16 presented orientations, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>).

The angular distance could be decomposed into two components: its magnitude and its sign. The magnitude of the angular distance (i.e. the absolute difference between stimulus and template orientation) solely determined the task-relevance of a stimulus: the closer the magnitude is to 0\u00ba, the more likely the stimulus led to a target response. By contrast, the sign of the angular distance (i.e., whether a stimulus was oriented clockwise or counter-clockwise with respect to the template) had no relevance to the task, because it did not influence how close that stimulus was to the current template. In the next analysis, we therefore attempted to isolate the effects of magnitude and sign on the neural response. We projected (using independently calculated weights, see Materials and methods) neural responses (from all 16 possible angular distances, and from all MEG/EEG sensors) onto two axes measuring separately the influence of magnitude and sign of the angular distance at each point in the trial (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mante et al., 2013</a>). This allowed an analysis of the MEG signal\u2019s sensitivity to the decision-relevant magnitude (measured by the amplitude of the response along the magnitude axis), independently of its sensitivity to the decision-irrelevant sign of the angular distance (measured along the sign axis)."

However, the result yields some insight into the particular neural implementation of the decision process in this task. Specifically, a representation of both magnitude and sign is consistent with the use of a probabilistic population code (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ma et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2008</a>). Probabilistic population codes assume that the brain uses the activation pattern across a population of neurons, each tuned to a different stimulus value (angular distance, in our case), to encode a probability distribution across the entire stimulus space (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ma et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Zemel et al., 1998</a>). The peak of activity of this distribution lies in or near neurons tuned to the presented angular distance. Therefore, angular distances with equal magnitude but different sign can be naturally separated in the population response, even if that dimension of the neural pattern is task-irrelevant. Importantly, this would not be the case if the entire population simply encoded the magnitude of the absolute distance (i.e., the overall match between stimulus and template, as is the case with some accumulator models of decision-making). Therefore, the presence of signed difference signals in the MEG response suggests that the brain uses a (probabilistic) population code to represent the decision variable in this task."

Each layer encoded information about one of the three task variables (stimulus, template, and angular distance). Each unit in a layer was tuned to a different orientation. Tuning in the decision layer represented <i>decision-relevant</i> angular distances, meaning that angles closer to 0\u00b0 represented stimuli closer to the current template. We created the same dissimilarity matrices used in the MEG/EEG analyses from synthetic responses generated by each layer in the model. Identical to <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, conditions with equal magnitude but different sign led to separable population responses in the template and angular distance layers.

Even subtle differences in dipole position or angle elicit statistically separable patterns at the scalp surface. For orientation decoding, these differences presumably depend on idiosyncrasies in the distribution of orientation columns along the cortical surface (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cichy et al., 2015</a>).

Nonetheless, neural circuits with complex spatiotemporal dynamics could plausibly provide a rich source of information for guiding flexible (<a href=\"#bib56\">Miller and Fusi, 2013</a>) and context-dependent behavior (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buonomano and Maass, 2009</a>)."

Even though template decoding lasted up to 300 ms after stimulus onset, the template-specific neural patterns cross-generalized to stimulus-specific patterns only in the earliest encoding phase. The transient, rather than sustained, activation of template-specific patterns may reflect the reactivation of a latent code (<a href=\"#bib57\">Mongillo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buonomano and Maass, 2009</a>) that was laid down in altered synaptic weights, but which is reactivated via top-down or stimulus-driven input.

This finding could provide an interesting insight into the potential mechanism underlying perceptual decision-making in our task. Specifically, probabilistic population codes may underlie the representation of the angular distance, and encode the sign of the angular distance as a by-product of decision-making. This could be a simple result of the use of a matched filter at an earlier stage. There is evidence that stimulus orientation is represented via population codes in early visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib29\">Graf et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berens et al., 2012</a>), with the activation profile across neurons tuned to many different orientations reflecting a probability distribution peaking at the orientation that is most likely present in the environment. If this population activity pattern is passed through a filter tuned to the orientation of the template, the resulting output population pattern could again reflect a probability distribution peaking at the most likely <i>relative</i> orientation of the stimulus with respect to the template. Because of the orientation symmetry of the filter mechanism, the output would also reflect the direction of the angular distance (clockwise or counterclockwise)."

The task consisted of eight brief (approximately 6\u00a0min) blocks, in which 480 stimuli were presented (resulting in a total of 3840 stimulus presentations per session). Each block began with the presentation of a target orientation (drawn at random, without replacement, from the 16 stimulus orientations), displayed centrally as a green line (4\u00b0 length). Thus, each session contained eight randomly drawn target orientations (they did not need to repeat across experimental sessions).

For each session, we sorted all trials by the presented stimulus orientation (into 16 bins), and then split each of these in half (separating odd and even trials). The odd\u2013even split allowed us to compare dissimilarity structures in two independent data sets, and to verify the reliability of the RSA. For each of the 32 bins, we calculated the baseline-corrected average evoked response (across trials) at all sensors and time points.

Therefore we used multiple regression to account for its possible influence (pattern component modeling, <a href=\"#bib22\">Diedrichsen et al., 2011</a>). A first nuisance regressor captured the differences in the absolute decision value, i.e. the distance between the <i>unsigned</i> angular distances (i.e. the distance between 0\u00b0 and \u201322.5\u00b0 was 22.5\u00b0, but the distance between \u201322.5\u00b0 and +22.5\u00b0 was 0\u00b0, rather than 45\u00b0). The second nuisance regressor was based on the similarity in response likelihood, which we estimated by calculating the participant-wise differences in response frequency between all decision-relevant angular distances. This regressor reflected differences in response likelihood between orientations, accounting for any effect of motor preparation. This regressor accounted for the effect of linear decision value on the MEG pattern. This pattern was regressed out because it could reflect two possible decision mechanisms: population-based coding, as proposed here, or linear evidence accumulation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>).

This was done by representing population responses as trajectories in neural state space (with each dimension representing a unique task variable). One approach, emulated here, has recently been described for populations of neural spike trains (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mante et al., 2013</a>). First, in order to de-noise the data, we smoothed data with a 20-ms Gaussian kernel and reduced the dimensionality of the MEG signal from 306 sensors (or 306+60 sensors for MEG+EEG sessions) to 30 principal components (PCs) by calculating coefficients over the average time series at each sensor. We then fit the task variables to the reduced-dimensionality data using a GLM. The regressors were derived from the three main task variables: stimulus orientation, template orientation, and angular distance. Since all three are circular variables, we used pairs of regressors, consisting of the sine and cosine of each task angle, yielding a design matrix consisting of six regressors in total."

The GLM was solved on normalized data (by subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance across all trials in the training set). This yielded a set of six regression coefficients (\u2018betas\u2019) for each time point in the trial and for each of the 30 PCs, which were then symmetrically orthogonalized (<a href=\"#bib18\">Colclough et al., 2015</a>; following <a href=\"#bib47\">Mante et al., 2013</a>). After normalizing the data from the test set (using the mean and variance from the training set), we calculated mean responses for all 16 angular distances in the test set (yielding a 16 angles \u00d7 30 PCs matrix). The means (16\u00d730) were then projected onto the task axes by multiplying them, time point by time point, with the betas (30 PCs \u00d7 6 regressors) from the training set, creating a 16\u00d76 matrix at each timepoint for each left-out block. We then averaged projections across the eight cross-validation folds. The resulting projections estimate the sensitivity of each condition (i.e., the 16 angular distances) to each task variable (i.e., the six regressors), separately for each time point in the trial."

In particular, the two regressors for the angular distance partialled out task-relevant and task-irrelevant aspects of the angular distance between stimulus and template: the cosine regressor, with a maximum of 1 at 0\u00ba (targets), a minimum of \u20131 at the farthest non-targets ( \u00b1 90\u00ba, in our 180\u00ba orientation space), and equal magnitudes for equivalent non-targets (e.g., 0.92 for both +11\u00ba and \u201311\u00ba), measured only the task-relevant aspect of the angle (i.e., the decision value, as shown in <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). By contrast, the sine regressor is insensitive to decision value (since, in 180\u00ba orientation space, sin(0\u00ba) = sin( \u00b1 90\u00ba) = 0), but distinguished between signed differences between non-targets (e.g., sin(+11\u00ba) = 0.38 = \u2212sin(\u201311\u00ba))."

At the beginning of the trial, before current stimulus input has been processed, the template layer encodes the current template layer, via a bump in activation in template-tuned neurons. This input can be instantiated in the template layer via top-down input from the 0\u00b0 unit in the decision layer (although other mechanisms for activating the template are also conceivable, such as periodic reactivation, e.g. <a href=\"#bib10\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Moser, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Eichenbaum, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Johnson and Redish, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009</a>). This activation of the template layer around the time of stimulus onset might correspond to the decoding profile for template information in the MEG data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Next, stimulus input is represented in the stimulus layer, again via a population activity profile peaking at neurons tuned to the currently presented stimulus (again corresponding to the decoding profile, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Stimulus layer activation is then fed forward into the template layer, where activation is multiplied point-by-point with the existing activation state. This could happen, for example, if neurons in the template layer change their gain to all input depending on their proximity to the current target orientation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carandini and Heeger, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">McAdams and Maunsell, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Silver et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Treue and Trujillo, 1999</a>). The resulting activation profile now represents the stimulus orientation, scaled by its similarity to the template\u2014while neurons tuned to the current orientation again have high activation, the height of that activation depends on stimulus-template similarity (and the peak is shifted towards the template orientation, with the magnitude of the shift depending on the ratio of stimulus and template tuning widths). This representation of the template and the stimulus in the same population (at slightly different but overlapping timepoints) might reflect why stimulus and template geometries cross-generalize (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>)."

Here, the response exhibits two decision-relevant features. First, the closer the current stimulus is to the template, the closer the decision layer peak is to the 0\u00b0 neuron. Second, as in the template layer, the height of the decision layer profile also depends on the proximity between stimulus and template, with highest activation for targets (<a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>), and the peak dropping off for increasingly distant non-targets (<a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3C\u2013E</a>). This decreasing amplitude may explain why near-targets were more separable than definite non-targets later in the trial epoch (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Downstream read-out units could use either the population\u2019s <i>peak location</i> (i.e. how close the maximum response is to the 0\u00b0 unit, as in <a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2008</a>) or its <i>peak activation</i> (as in more classical decision models) to determine whether a target is present or absent."

The authors mimic the geometry of neural responses with a toy computational model that consists of a perceptual, template and decision layer in which the decision layer uses population coding."

The main advances of the paper are in showing the efficacy of MEEG methods for decoding and in demonstrating that the search template is transiently re-activated, which is worthwhile. Many of the other interpretations seem to be based on overly stringent (and probably incorrect) assumptions about how a neural code must be perfectly stationary over time, in conjunction with a possible misunderstanding about how different dipole orientations would produce different topographies without reflecting different neural computations. The paper should be reframed. The authors should consider which of the elements they have direct evidence for and which are speculations."

One reviewer notes that, after <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, no data are shown and, by <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, interpretations are based on parameters far abstracted that it is difficult to know how those relate back to the data. As such, the manuscript is quite dense, with many highly complex analyses and results. These analyses are highly sophisticated, but it is not always clear why a particular analysis is performed. In the same vein, some details of the response-related coding analysis were also unclear. For example, why does the cosine of 'stim-template' reflect the task-relevant information, and the sine the irrelevant information?"

We would need to see how the codes differ, for example with qualitatively changing topographies. If the neural source is oscillatory, then rapid changes in the phases would limit temporal extendability to one cycle and could lead to the misinterpretation that \"multiple stimulus-specific codes must have been activated in sequence\". Thus if the codes really vary over time, the topographies would have to be different in a way that is inconsistent with rotating or oscillating dipoles. This is a critical point, because the authors rely on the interpretation of the \"code\" being dynamic through the rest of the manuscript."

There is an implicit assumption here, which is that a \"neural code\" is an instantaneous spatial pattern, and so if it changes slightly from millisecond to millisecond, the \"code\" must be different. This assumption is inconsistent with neurophysiology: It is well established that neurons are sensitive to their history of inputs, and that their precise spike timing carries information about input patterns. Thus a specific representation can include time (frequency multiplexing is a simple illustration of this). Therefore, what the authors call a dynamic code could simply be a static code that has time as a dimension. If the authors were to interpret the findings more conservatively this wouldn't be problematic."

There are plenty of other reasons why a stable sensory code would nevertheless not generalize over time. For example, MEG measures a mixture of activity of many sources at any moment in time. If a stable source would be accompanied by a variety of other neural sources that change over time (which is almost certainly the case) this could also result in a (partial) break-down of generalization. More generally, the fact that a machine learning algorithm can \"decode\" a particular feature/stimulus, does not imply that the brain has \"encoded\" this feature. The 'decoder' could have picked up on any feature that has a non-zero correlation with the feature under investigation. Again it would be prudent to better qualify what can and cannot be concluded from the data."

The authors state that the signed difference between template and stimulus is passed down, in line with predictive coding. But also the stimulus itself is encoded, see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. And the prediction error in predictive coding would serve to update perception, not a decision about whether a percept is different from an internal template. This signed difference is mandated by the task in this case. Finally, the statement \"Our results, using non-invasive imaging, suggest that template and stimulus coding may be similarly segregated across cortical layers\" is quite over-stated. The authors investigate whole-head MEG responses, localizing their signals to roughly the back of the head. How that would suggest segregation across cortical layers is very unclear at best."

Many of the other interpretations seem to be based on overly stringent (and probably incorrect) assumptions about how a neural code must be perfectly stationary over time, in conjunction with a possible misunderstanding about how different dipole orientations would produce different topographies without reflecting different neural computations.

High-temporal resolution methods provide a unique window into such dynamics, where fMRI has previously emphasised a more static patterns of activity associated with neural coding. With MEG in particular, even very subtle differences in dipole orientation can generate different patterns at the scalp surface. This property of MEG probably underpins our ability to decode stimulus orientation based on spatial patterns (see Cichy et al., 2015, NeuroImage; and relevant commentary Stokes, Wolff and Spaak, in press, Trends in Cog Sci). Formal modelling in Cichy et al. shows that even neighbouring sources can generate separable topographies within individual subjects, and this rich source of spatial information can be exploited by multivariate decoding methods. Moreover, our results suggest that these dipoles change over time, resulting in dynamic topographies that render decoding time-specific (despite stable representational structure, see RSA analyses). Such activity dynamics, evident in high-temporal resolution methods, clearly show that we need to move away from overly rigid interpretations of stable codes. In parallel, insights gained from multi-electrode recordings in animal models are helping to unravel the computational significance of dynamic coding."

We argue that only the magnitude axis is relevant to the task (and to behaviour). Our reasoning is as follows: participants have a noisy estimate of the template orientation, and a noisy estimate of the current stimulus orientation. If the absolute difference between these two estimates falls below a decision threshold, participants decide that a target is present. Because the decision threshold is non-zero, there will be some false alarms, and because both estimates are noisy, there will sometimes be misses. This accounts for the behavioural data shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. Importantly, this strategy relies solely on the absolute angular difference between stimulus and template (what we now term the magnitude). In our case, the magnitude of the angular distance is captured by its cosine (with a peak at 0\u00ba, when the stimulus matches exactly the template, and a trough when the stimulus differs maximally from the template). Conversely, the sign of the angular distance (i.e., whether the stimulus is clockwise or counter clockwise to the template) should be entirely irrelevant to the task. The sign of the angular distance is captured by its sine (with a peak at +90\u00ba and a trough at -90\u00ba). We have attempted to convey this in rewriting the section (Discussion)."

Thus a specific representation can include time (frequency multiplexing is a simple illustration of this).

This is exactly the purpose of our comparison between decoding and representational geometry. Together, these two complementary approaches demonstrate the reviewers\u2019 point: dynamic changes in patterns of activity, yet stable representational structure (e.g. \u201ca static code with a time dimension\u201d).

We also note that lack of phase-locking would cause a break-down of such a pattern.

If a stable source would be accompanied by a variety of other neural sources that change over time (which is almost certainly the case) this could also result in a (partial) break-down of generalization. More generally, the fact that a machine learning algorithm can \"decode\" a particular feature/stimulus, does not imply that the brain has \"encoded\" this feature.

For example, systematic non-linear interactions could in principle limit decodability across different time points. Such interactions would limit cross-temporal generalisation, which also raises the question how such dynamics are handled in the brain. We agree with the reviewers that decodability does not necessarily reflect encoding in the brain (and now touch on this point in the Discussion). Until we understand exactly how activity patterns are read out by downstream areas, we cannot be sure what information is meaningfully encoded in the signal.

The color in the figure indicates the strength of decoding, with the cluster-corrected significant regions indicated by the opaque shading. Our index of dynamic coding requires both on-diagonal timepoints to be significantly higher than the corresponding cross-temporal (off-diagonal) generalization, which is why the dynamic cluster (black outline) only appears in a relatively small part of the plot where corresponding on-diagonal coding is high. Importantly, the dynamic cluster includes some points near the diagonal: while these still show significant decoding, it is nonetheless significantly lower than the corresponding on-diagonal timepoints. In this sense, we interpret the underlying pattern to have changed significantly, even though there is also some shared pattern allowing for significant cross-generalisation. Conversely, there are timepoints on the diagonal (approx. 350-400 ms, near the end of the significant cluster) that show significant decoding that is nonetheless too weak to be significantly larger than the off-diagonal \u2013 for this reason, the off-diagonal dynamic coding cluster (i.e. the black outline) might not always extend quite as far along the y-axis as the significant on-diagonal cluster."

That is, we should expect the significant cluster in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> (within-time template decoding) to match significant on-diagonal timepoints in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> (cross-temporal template decoding). The discrepancy was an oversight on our part: it was caused by an accidental inclusion of an old version of the within-time analysis using slightly different baselining (from -250 to -100 ms, instead of -200 to -150 ms). We have now updated the figure accordingly, and as expected, the within-time decoding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) is also significant just before stimulus onset (-72 ms onwards). A comparison of the old and new result shows almost identical curves, but the onset of template decoding is now significantly earlier than the onset of stimulus decoding. We have updated the corresponding part of the Results. However, this change in the onset of the significant window does not change our interpretation of the results, since we had already discussed the likelihood that part of the template reactivation could occur shortly before stimulus onset (end of Discussion) as the same pre-stimulus time period was near-significant (p &lt; 0.07) even in the previously reported analysis."

In preparing the final version to accompany this paper, we found other minor inconsistencies, none of which significantly change the qualitative or statistical aspects of our results. Specifically, the cross-time decoding analysis of the stimulus and relative angle (presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and 4C</a>) was based on a sliding window size of 16 ms rather than the stated 20 ms. Both yield almost identical results, and therefore we have simply updated the figure with the appropriate analysis without any other change. The cross-generalization analysis between templates and stimuli (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) had also used a different baseline (as stated above). Using the more consistent baseline yields the same cluster in time, although it is only a strong trend after correcting for multiple comparisons (p = 0.06). We have updated the results accordingly. The representational similarity comparison of templates and stimuli (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B,G</a>) was calculated with a different baseline as stated (-250 to -100 ms, i.e., consistent with the old version of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We have now updated this figure using the baseline reported in the Methods (-200 to -150 ms). Again, the results remain practically unchanged, however we note that the significant cluster in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> has shifted slightly. Finally, the angular distance analysis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) had also used a slightly different baseline window. Once again, the updated results are almost indistinguishable."
