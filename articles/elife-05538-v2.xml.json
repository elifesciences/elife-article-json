To globally quantify these effects, we crossed two divergent mouse strains and asked how genotype of the mother or of the embryo drives gene expression phenotype genomewide. Embryonic expression of 331 genes depends on the genotype of the mother. Embryonic genotype controls allele-specific expression of 1594 genes and a highly overlapping set of cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). A marked paucity of trans-eQTL suggests that the widespread expression differences do not propagate through the embryonic gene regulatory network. The cis-eQTL genes exhibit lower-than-average evolutionary conservation and are depleted for developmental regulators, consistent with purifying selection acting on expression phenotype of pattern formation genes. The widespread effect of maternal and embryonic genotype in conjunction with the purifying selection we uncovered suggests that embryogenesis is an important and understudied reservoir of phenotypic variation."

To globally quantify these effects, we crossed two divergent mouse strains and asked how genotype of the mother or of the embryo drives gene expression phenotype genomewide. Embryonic expression of 331 genes depends on the genotype of the mother. Embryonic genotype controls allele-specific expression of 1594 genes and a highly overlapping set of cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). A marked paucity of trans-eQTL suggests that the widespread expression differences do not propagate through the embryonic gene regulatory network. The cis-eQTL genes exhibit lower-than-average evolutionary conservation and are depleted for developmental regulators, consistent with purifying selection acting on expression phenotype of pattern formation genes. The widespread effect of maternal and embryonic genotype in conjunction with the purifying selection we uncovered suggests that embryogenesis is an important and understudied reservoir of phenotypic variation."

Surprisingly, the impact of genetic variation on gene regulation and the relative importance of the genetic mechanisms underlying regulatory variation in mammalian embryogenesis remain undefined. There are four broad categories of genetic mechanisms of gene expression regulation: imprinting, parental effects, cis-regulation, and trans-regulation. All of these are potentially subject to natural selection and provide genetic windows into the forces that shape gene regulatory evolution. Here, we quantify their impact and relevance in mammalian embryogenesis by asking which of these genetic mechanisms reveal evolutionary divergence or constraint since the last common ancestor of two distantly related mouse strains, C57BL/6 (B6) and Cast/Ei (Cast)."

The progeny's imprinted gene expression patterns result from epigenetic modifications put in place in the previous generation and reflect the particular genetic architecture at these specialized loci. A recent genome-wide survey estimated that fewer than 200 genes are imprinted in mice and humans (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babak et al., 2008</a>). Imprinting is thought to play a critical role in early embryonic and placental development in mammals and has been shown to influence post-natal health and behavior [Reviewed in <a href=\"#bib33\">Peters (2014)</a>]."

Parental effects produce phenotypic variation that depends, directly or indirectly, on the genotype of either the mother or father, rather than that of the offspring. Therefore, the resulting phenotypic patterns lag a generation behind the genetic transmission of the causal variants. The most well-studied parental genetic effects are caused by deposition of maternal transcripts into the egg prior to fertilization, resulting in differences in early embryonic development depending on the genotype of the mother. Certain genes have also been shown to respond to maternal influence after birth through genetically defined maternal behaviors (<a href=\"#bib44\">Weaver et al., 2004</a>). Because of the small contribution, through the sperm, of the paternal transcriptome to the fertilized zygote, and because of the stronger maternal contribution to child rearing in most model organisms, parental effects are typically thought of as synonymous with maternal effects, although true paternal effects are known to exist (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rando, 2012</a>)."

However, neither the causal molecular mechanism for these effects in the mother nor the responding genes in the embryo have been identified and few studies to date have discriminated between prenatal and postnatal effects. Maternal effects likely contribute to the heritability of complex traits but have been confounded with family structure in mouse as well as human studies (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mott et al., 2014</a>)."

Regulatory variants near their target genes usually act in cis, by modifying the activity of a promoter or enhancer, but very occasionally act in trans if they affect a gene product that regulates a nearby locus. One approach to quantifying cis and trans regulation in model organisms involves assaying gene expression in two parental lines compared to allele-specific expression (ASE) in the hybrids (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wittkopp et al., 2004</a>) and asking whether alleles are regulated differently in the parentals compared to the hybrids. In adult flies and mice, these analyses have demonstrated that cis and trans regulatory variants frequently target the same genes, often with opposite, compensatory effects on the target's expression (<a href=\"#bib25\">McManus et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Goncalves et al., 2012</a>). Recent genome-wide studies of ASE patterns across many individuals have demonstrated the ability of high-throughput sequencing methods to directly identify genes with cis-regulatory variants (<a href=\"#bib29\">Montgomery et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Pickrell et al., 2010</a>)."

Genome-wide eQTL studies have demonstrated that the strongest genetic variation in expression regulation generally occurs in variants located proximally to their target genes, presumably acting in cis. While typically fewer in number, trans-regulatory variants affect both alleles of each target gene and can affect expression of many genes simultaneously, resulting in a large aggregate effect."

However, these approaches have not yet been applied to understand the global relationship between genetic variation and gene expression during mammalian embryogenesis, and while imprinting has been studied extensively, the contribution of maternal effects on mammalian embryonic gene expression has never been addressed. For several reasons, it is likely that patterns of regulatory divergence differ between embryos and adults. First, eQTL studies have demonstrated dynamic trans-regulatory variation during <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> larval development (<a href=\"#bib14\">Francesconi and Lehner, 2014</a>). Second, recent studies in flies and fish have demonstrated higher expression of more ancient conserved genes as well as more conserved gene expression patterns during embryogenesis compared to the adult (<a href=\"#bib11\">Domazet-Lo\u0161o and Tautz, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kalinka et al., 2010</a>).

Furthermore, we found that evolutionary constraint at the DNA sequence level (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cooper et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Davydov et al., 2010</a>) was lowest in the most significant cis-eQTL (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>; rho = \u22120.14, p = 6 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221213</sup>; n = 2788). Similarly, ASE magnitude of effect correlated negatively with evolutionary constraint (rho = \u22120.10, p = 9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>, n = 2612), whereas cis-eQTL in adult mouse tissues showed no correlation (|rho| &lt; 0.05). Thus, the strong enrichment for cis-eQTL/ASE in less conserved genes is unique to embryos."

Gene expression divergence of the type we quantified in this work occurs as a result of polymorphisms in regulatory regions or in expressed regulatory gene products.

Under the first hypothesis, the substantial DNA sequence divergence between mouse strains would be reflected in many expression differences. The alternative hypothesis is that few expression changes would be detected between strains. This hypothesis is suggested by the developmental hourglass model (<a href=\"#bib11\">Domazet-Lo\u0161o and Tautz, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kalinka et al., 2010</a>), which posits that gene expression patterns are most highly conserved in the middle of embryonic development (the so-called \u2018phylotypic stage\u2019)."

In contrast to adult tissues, eQTL acting in our embryos were correlated with lower DNA sequence conservation, supporting the conclusion that evolutionary constraint on gene expression regulation is markedly stronger during mammalian embryogenesis than in the adult.

Perhaps because of the nearness of our embryos to the mouse phylotypic stage, or because of fundamental differences between mice and worms, we found that incorporating developmental timing (i.e., somite number) into our eQTL model did not alter the balance between cis- and trans-regulation. Somite number was, however, correlated with significant changes in ASE, indicating differential developmental timing of gene expression between the Cast and B6 strains. In particular, we found that alleles of several hemoglobin-related genes, including the adult beta globins and transferrin, were expressed at differing levels between the strains at early stages of the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin transition, but then equalize by the end of our developmental time course. These results demonstrate our ability to identify subtle tissue-specific expression differences between strains, despite sequencing from whole embryos containing a mix of tissues."

We found that cis-regulatory variation caused the largest divergence in overall gene expression in mouse embryos, affecting over 1000 genes with up to sevenfold differences in expression levels between the strains. These cis-regulatory variants did not translate into trans-regulatory divergence, and we identified only \u223c10 trans-eQTL genomewide. Imprinting affected the allelic balance of dozens of genes, generally resulting in complete or nearly complete silencing of the inactive allele. Finally, we identified over 300 maternal effect target genes. The number of maternal effect targets, and their overall significance, are only slightly more modest than cis-regulatory effects, but nonetheless substantial, with approximately 1/3 as many genes involved, and maximal effect size of up to 3.5-fold difference or approximately 1/2 as large. Given this context, it is clear that maternal effects can play a substantial genetic role in determining embryonic gene expression patterns. We speculate that maternal effects contribute to evolutionary divergence, allowing expression heterogeneity in the embryo to build as a result of differences in the adult mother, where gene regulatory networks show less evolutionary constraint than in the developing embryo."
