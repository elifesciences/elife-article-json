We found that, in the epithelial follicle stem cell (FSC) lineage of the <i>Drosophila</i> ovary, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling functions specifically in the FSCs to promote the unique partially polarized state of the FSC, establish apical\u2013basal polarity throughout the lineage, and promote FSC maintenance in the niche. In addition, we identified a novel connection between EGFR signaling and the cell-polarity regulator liver kinase B1 (LKB1), which indicates that EGFR signals through both the Ras\u2013Raf\u2013MEK\u2013Erk pathway and through the LKB1\u2013AMPK pathway to suppress apical identity. The development of apical\u2013basal polarity is the earliest visible difference between FSCs and their daughters, and our findings demonstrate that the EGFR-mediated regulation of apical\u2013basal polarity is essential for the segregation of stem cell and daughter cell fates."

We found that, in the epithelial follicle stem cell (FSC) lineage of the <i>Drosophila</i> ovary, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling functions specifically in the FSCs to promote the unique partially polarized state of the FSC, establish apical\u2013basal polarity throughout the lineage, and promote FSC maintenance in the niche. In addition, we identified a novel connection between EGFR signaling and the cell-polarity regulator liver kinase B1 (LKB1), which indicates that EGFR signals through both the Ras\u2013Raf\u2013MEK\u2013Erk pathway and through the LKB1\u2013AMPK pathway to suppress apical identity. The development of apical\u2013basal polarity is the earliest visible difference between FSCs and their daughters, and our findings demonstrate that the EGFR-mediated regulation of apical\u2013basal polarity is essential for the segregation of stem cell and daughter cell fates."

For example, it may be that the lack of an apical domain in the stem cells shields them from signals in the tissue that promote differentiation, thus allowing them to remain undifferentiated. Conversely, the development of an apical domain in the differentiating cells may expose them to signals that promote their differentiation, and also allow them to form a barrier and perform the other roles of epithelial tissue."

Although the signals that specify these different cell fates act directly on stem cells and their immediate daughters, the process of differentiation in the non-stem cell daughters can be gradual, sometimes occurring over the course of several cell divisions. Indeed, in many stem cell lineages, the non-stem cell daughter initially has the potential to re-enter the niche and become a stem cell, indicating that it does not immediately commit to the fully differentiated fate (<a href=\"#bib29\">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Simons and Clevers, 2011</a>). Instead, newly produced stem cell daughters are likely in a state of flux, undergoing a wide range of molecular and cytological changes. Previous studies have exploited visible differences in the cellular and sub-cellular morphology of stem cells and their daughters to investigate the signals that govern the segregation of cell fates (<a href=\"#bib53\">Xie and Spradling, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lim et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kiger et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yin et al., 2013</a>). In several different <i>Drosophila</i> and mammalian epithelia, the stem cells have a constricted or immature apical domain relative to the differentiated cell types in the tissue (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Buske et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Huo and Macara, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kronen et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, signals that regulate the development of cell polarity may play an important role in the segregation of epithelial stem cell and daughter cell fates.

The FSCs have a lateral domain (which includes Discs large (Dlg), Lethal giant larvae (Lgl), and Scribble), a basal domain (defined by the localization of integrins to the surface that contacts the basement membrane), but no discrete apical domain. Instead, apical determinants are either undetectable or diffusely localized throughout the FSCs. In contrast, nascent apical domains are visible in adjacent, differentiating prefollicle cells. The apical\u2013lateral determinant, Bazooka (Baz, the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of Par-3), is the first marker to become visible on the cell membrane, followed by atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), which localizes to the apical surface and positions Baz at the apical\u2013lateral junctions. Further downstream, proteins in the Crumbs complex colocalize with aPKC and reinforce the apical identity. Adherens junctions also relocalize during follicle cell differentiation from a broad band along the anterior lateral surface of FSCs to discrete puncta at the apical\u2013lateral junctions in differentiated follicle cells."

However, since these complexes are absent or immature during the establishment of cell polarity, additional signals are required at earlier stages. One such signal is provided by liver kinase B1 (LKB1), which regulates multiple proteins involved in the establishment of cell polarity, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nakano and Takashima, 2012</a>). LKB1 is activated by protein kinase A (PKA) and Par-1, and is required for follicle cell polarity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Martin and St Johnston, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Haack et al., 2013</a>). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling may also be important for follicle cell polarity because a global reduction of the function of <i>Egfr</i> or of the downstream EGFR pathway modifiers <i>brainiac</i> or <i>egghead</i> disrupts the architecture of the follicle epithelium; however cell-polarity markers were not investigated (<a href=\"#bib10\">Goode et al., 1992</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">1996</a>). Here we show that EGFR signaling promotes FSC maintenance in the niche, that EGFR is required specifically in FSCs to establish cell polarity throughout the FSC lineage, and that EGFR signals through both the canonical Ras\u2013Raf\u2013MEK\u2013Erk pathway and through LKB1 and AMPK to suppress apical identity."

In addition, we noticed bright pErk staining in cells at the position of the FSC. As FSCs can be unambiguously identified as the anterior-most cell in an FSC clone induced in adult flies by mitotic recombination, we generated FSC clones marked by the absence of green florescent protein (GFP) and stained for pErk. Indeed, we found that bright pErk staining was detected in 90% (n = 28/31) of FSCs identified within an FSC clone, but was completely undetectable in 87% (n = 27/31) of prefollicle cells just downstream of the niche (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). In the remaining 13% of prefollicle cells just downstream of the niche (n = 4/31), pErk was also detectable, which could be due to the perdurance of the pErk signal in cells that had recently exited the niche (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To determine whether this pErk signal is dependent upon EGFR, we generated FSC clones that are homozygous for <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup>, a loss-of-function allele, and stained for pErk.

In this assay, ovarioles that start out as mosaic (1 marked FSC) become fully marked (2 marked FSCs) or fully unmarked (0 marked FSCs) when the daughter of one FSC replaces the other FSC. Thus, FSC turnover causes a decrease in the frequency of mosaic ovarioles, and an increase in the frequencies of fully marked and fully unmarked ovarioles. If both the marked and unmarked FSCs are wildtype, they will replace each other at equal rates so the frequencies of fully marked and fully unmarked ovarioles increase at approximately equal rates. If the clonally marked FSCs are mutant for a gene that is required for FSC maintenance in the niche, the marked FSCs will be rapidly lost, causing a disproportionate increase in the frequency of fully unmarked ovarioles. Conversely, if the clonally marked FSCs contain a genetic modification that enhances their ability to occupy the niche or replace wildtype FSCs, unmarked FSCs will be preferentially lost, causing a disproportionate increase in the frequency of fully marked ovarioles."

We found that even at 2 dpci the frequency of <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> FSC clones in the experimental group was still significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01) than that of the control group (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Therefore, we next measured the frequency of all FSC and follicle cell clones in the germarium of each ovariole at 2 dpci and found that the combined frequencies of FSC clones and prefollicle cell clones (i.e. those originating in follicle cells downstream of the FSC) were nearly the same in the control and experimental groups (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This suggests that the low frequency of <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> FSC clones at 2 dpci was due to a very rapid loss of <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> FSCs and not a lower rate of clone induction, as explored further in the next section."

To test this, we used the MARCM system (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lee and Luo, 2001</a>), which makes it possible to express a transgene of interest in all of the cells in the clone. We generated groups of flies in which the clonally marked cells were either wildtype (control group) or overexpressing a constitutively activated allele of <i>Egfr</i> (<i>Egfr</i><sup><i>\u03bbtop</i></sup>) (experimental group) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Queenan et al., 1997</a>). We induced clones in paired control and experimental groups, and assayed for FSC clone frequencies at 7, 14, and 21 dpci. Whereas the frequency and distribution of FSC clones was similar in both groups at 7 dpci (p &gt; 0.33), the frequency of fully marked ovarioles was significantly higher in the experimental group compared to the control group at 21 dpci (18% in wildtype vs 31% in <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>\u03bbtop</i></sup>, p &lt; 0.02) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This indicates that FSCs and prefollicle cells with constitutively active EGFR signaling are hypercompetitive for the niche relative to the wildtype FSCs in the same tissue."

Indeed, the <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> cells in these clones failed to incorporate into the follicle epithelium and did not encapsulate germ cell cysts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To determine whether these cells had polarity defects, we stained ovarioles with <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> FSC clones for markers of apical, lateral, and basal identity. We found that the lateral Dlg was undetectable on the cell membranes in 100% (n = 38/38) of <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> FSC clones (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In addition, we found that the apical marker aPKC, the apical\u2013lateral marker Baz, and the adherens junction component DE-cadherin (DE-cad) were also undetectable in all <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> FSC clones (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013I</a>). Moreover, the basal marker \u03b2-integrin was detectable in the cytoplasm but not on the cell membrane in all <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> FSC clones (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). In contrast, polarity was not disrupted in 96% (n = 103/107) of negatively marked wildtype FSC clones (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), and we consistently found that all of these cell-polarity markers were properly localized on the cell membranes of <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>+/f24</i></sup> follicle cells in germaria with <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> clones (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013J</a>). In addition, using the MARCM system we generated positively marked FSC clones homozygous for another loss of function allele, <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f2</i></sup>, and found that 94% (n = 17/18) had an identical phenotype as negatively marked <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> FSC clones, while polarity was not disrupted in 99% (n = 83/84) of positively marked wildtype FSC clones (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Lastly, we found that expression of a dominant-negative allele of <i>Egfr</i> (<i>Egfr</i><sup><i>DN</i></sup>) using a follicle cell-specific driver 109-30-Gal4 (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hartman et al., 2010</a>) phenocopied the polarity defects we observed in <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> clones, albeit with a lower penetrance (46% of germaria, n = 118/255, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013C). Together, these controls verify that the phenotypes we observed are not due to the genetic background, that they are not an artifact of the dissection process (<a href=\"#bib11\">Haack et al., 2013</a>), and that the loss of cell polarity in <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> and <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f2</i></sup> FSC clones is cell autonomous."

In wildtype germaria, apical domains begin to form in Region 2b of the germarium, just downstream from the FSC niche, but the follicle cells do not acquire an organized, cuboidal shape with a clear apical surface until Region 3 of the germarium (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We found that Region 3 cysts were always present in germaria from control flies, but that 21% (n = 25/119) of the germaria with constitutively active EGFR signaling were elongated and completely lacked a Region 3 cyst (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In nearly all of the remaining germaria (70%, n = 83/119), Region 3 cysts were present but aPKC was delocalized from the cell surface of follicle cells surrounding these cysts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). In addition, many of the follicle cells in this region were not cuboidal but instead had a more pointed shape that resembled FSCs or early prefollicle cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Interestingly, Dlg was still detectable on the cell membranes of follicle cells with constitutively active EGFR signaling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,D</a>), indicating that lateral identity was largely unaffected in these cells. In addition, bright puncta of Baz staining were still visible on the cell membrane near sites of contact with the germline in 76% (n = 86/110) of these germaria, suggesting that apical\u2013lateral identity is also largely unaffected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D,F</a>). Consistent with this finding, Baz remains localized to the apical\u2013lateral junctions in <i>aPKC</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> follicle cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Morais-de-S\u00e1 et al., 2010</a>).

We found that FSC clones that were homozygous for <i>Ras85D</i><sup><i>[\u0394c40b]</i></sup>, a loss-of-function allele (here referred to as <i>Ras85D</i><sup>\u2212</sup>) had a phenotype that was similar to, but less penetrant than, <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> clones (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>).

First, we found that cell polarity was disrupted in 46% (n = 17/37) of FSC clones that were homozygous for <i>lkb1</i><sup><i>[4A4\u22122]</i></sup>, a deletion allele that is predicted to be a null (<a href=\"#bib27\">Martin and St Johnston, 2003</a>) (here referred to as <i>lkb1</i><sup>\u2212</sup>), whereas polarity was not disrupted in 93% (n = 62/67) of <i>lkb1</i><sup>\u2212</sup> prefollicle cell clones (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). When activated, LKB1 can phosphorylate AMPK at multiple sites, including threonine-184 (T172 in humans), which can be detected with a monoclonal antibody against the human epitope (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pan and Hardie, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lizcano et al., 2004</a>). Therefore, we stained for phosphorylated AMPK (pAMPK) and found that it was detectable in follicle cells of 59% (n = 95/160) of wildtype germaria (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Next, we stained for pAMPK in germaria with <i>lkb1</i><sup>\u2212</sup> FSC clones. We found that, whereas pAMPK signal was absent in 100% (n = 57/57) of <i>lkb1</i><sup>\u2212</sup> FSC clones, it was clearly detectable in the wildtype (<i>lkb1</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup>) follicle cells in 68% (n = 39/57) of these same germaria (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013E</a>).

EGFR activates both the canonical Ras-mediated pathway leading to the phosphorylation of Erk, and the LKB1\u2013AMPK pathway. Both Erk and AMPK are kinases that can regulate gene activity by activating transcription factors and phosphorylating proteins in the cytoplasm. AMPK directly promotes the lateral identity in polarized cells by activating lateral proteins. PKA is an upstream activator of LKB1 in follicle cells, and PKA can be activated by EGFR signaling, suggesting that EGFR signaling may activate LKB1 via PKA. EGFR signaling may suppress apical polarity either directly by regulating the transcription or activity of apical proteins, or indirectly by enhancing the activity of lateral proteins that suppress the localization of apical proteins. Low levels of EGFR signaling in prefollicle cells relieves this suppression, allowing apical domains to form and permitting differentiation away from the stem cell fate."

In polarized epithelial cells, apical and lateral identities are maintained by a process of mutual exclusion in which the cortical localization of the Par-6/aPKC complex is suppressed by Lgl and vice versa (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hutterer et al., 2004</a>). Thus, it may be that EGFR signaling is required to maintain the unique partially polarized state of the FSCs but, once both apical and lateral domains are present together, they become self-sustaining. Indeed, the reactivation of EGFR signaling in follicle cells during mid- and late-oogenesis does not seem to disrupt polarity, suggesting that the influence of EGFR signaling on cell polarity is diminished in these stages when the cells are more differentiated and fully polarized. This mutual dependency may also explain why prefollicle cells produced by FSCs that are mutant for <i>Egfr</i> exhibit cell-polarity defects (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The segregation of the basal and lateral protein complexes during an FSC division has not been characterized, but it is plausible that prefollicle cells inherit their basal and lateral domain identities from the FSC. Since <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> FSCs lack basal and lateral domain identities, they may be unable to contribute polarity information to their prefollicle cell daughters, leaving these cells with no polarity cues to build upon and therefore rendering them incapable of specifying basal, lateral or apical domains."

First, our observations that loss of <i>lkb1</i> phenocopies loss of <i>Egfr</i>, and that constitutively active LKB1 partially rescues the phenotypes caused by a decrease in <i>Egfr</i> function, indicate that EGFR and LKB1 operate together to promote cell polarity in the FSC lineage. Second, our observation that the LKB1-dependent phosphorylation of AMPK is dependent in part on <i>Egfr</i> suggests that LKB1 is activated by EGFR signaling. LKB1 is a \u2018master regulator\u2019 of cell polarity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Partanen et al., 2013</a>), capable of initiating apical\u2013basal polarity even in cultured cells that lack cell\u2013cell contacts (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baas et al., 2004</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, LKB1 is required in follicle cells to prevent apical proteins from encroaching into the lateral domain (<a href=\"#bib27\">Martin and St Johnston, 2003</a>). Moreover, although the intermediate steps were not investigated, a recent study demonstrated that EGFR promotes apical constriction of epithelial cells in the tracheal placode during <i>Drosophila</i> development (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</a>)."

Thus, it is possible that the activation of LKB1 in the FSC lineage is also induced by pErk, which could promote the transcription or post-translational activation of either LKB1 or an upstream activator of LKB1. However, our finding that the loss of <i>Ras85D</i> produces a substantially less penetrant phenotype than loss of <i>Egfr</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) suggests that the pathway bifurcates upstream of <i>Ras85D</i>, placing <i>lkb1</i> in a separate pathway downstream of EGFR. Consistent with this possibility, a study of the adult <i>Drosophila</i> brain found that EGFR can activate PKA in a Ras-independent manner (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hannan et al., 2006</a>), and PKA is a well-established activator of LKB1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Collins et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sapkota et al., 2001</a>). Moreover, each of the individual steps of this pathway from EGFR through to PKA, LKB1, and AMPK to apical\u2013basal polarity have been observed in studies of mammalian tissues (<a href=\"#bib6\">Collins et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tortora and Ciardiello, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Xie et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</a>), suggesting that these connections make up an evolutionarily conserved pathway."

Specifically, our finding that <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> FSC clones are rapidly lost from the tissue indicates that EGFR is required for the FSC fate; whereas our observation that constitutively active EGFR signaling causes prefollicle cells to retain an FSC-like morphology and replace wildtype stem cells more often suggests that EGFR signaling must be downregulated to permit differentiation. EGFR signaling may promote the FSC fate in several ways. First, the activation of the canonical EGFR pathway leading to the phosphorylation of Erk is likely to directly regulate the activity of many genes in the FSC self-renewal program. Second, EGFR signaling may interact with other pathways, such as the Wingless pathway, that are required for FSC self-renewal (<a href=\"#bib46\">Song and Xie, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sahai-Hernandez and Nystul, 2013</a>). Indeed, EGFR and Wingless signaling cooperate to specify cell fate in other <i>Drosophila</i> tissues such as the wing disc (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sz\u00fcts et al., 1997</a>) and the intestinal epithelium (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2011</a>), and thus there may be similar cross-talk in the FSC niche compartment. Third, our data strongly suggest that EGFR signaling is required for FSC maintenance in the niche in part because of its role in regulating cell polarity. Specifically, our observation that DE-cad and \u03b2-integrin are absent from the membranes of cells in <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> FSC clones indicates that EGFR signaling is required for the formation of the cellular junctions that are known to anchor FSCs in the niche (<a href=\"#bib45\">Song and Xie, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">O'Reilly et al., 2008</a>). In addition, the lack of polarity in <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>f24</i></sup> FSCs could also affect other processes, such as cellular trafficking, cell division, and signal transduction that may be important for the self-renewal program."

EGFR signaling is known to promote a stem-like or less differentiated state in other epithelial tissues as well. For example, EGFR signaling induces proliferation of progenitor cells in the basal layer of the interfollicular epidermis, and is downregulated in cells within the suprabasal layers that are differentiating into mature keratinocytes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2006</a>). Likewise, EGFR signaling is required for the maintenance and proliferation of the stem cells in the <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal epithelium (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, EGFR signaling is commonly upregulated in epithelial cancers, such as triple negative breast cancer, that have a stem cell-like molecular profile. However, the specific effects of EGFR signaling in the stem cells of these tissues are not well understood. In addition, although EGFR signaling can promote a loss of cell polarity in differentiated epithelial cells by contributing to the activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, it is unclear whether or how this function of EGFR signaling relates to cell fate specification. Our study suggests that EGFR signaling promotes the stem cell fate at least in part by specifying the unique polarity of the stem cell. It will be interesting to determine whether the regulation of cell polarity is a common mechanism by which cell fates are specified in other epithelial tissues as well."

When a clone is induced in an FSC, the labeled FSC remains in the niche and continues to divide as the clone grows (<a href=\"#bib26\">Margolis and Spradling, 1995</a>). Therefore, these clones can span across many follicles and will always include at least one cell at the Region 2a/2b border, where the FSC niche is located. In contrast, when a clone is induced downstream from the FSC (for example in a prefollicle cell produced by an FSC), the clone will move out of the germarium as it grows; it will not span across more than two follicles and will not cover more than approximately one half of a single follicle (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nystul and Spradling, 2010</a>). Occasionally, the FSC that is maintaining an FSC clone is lost from the niche due to stem cell replacement, which results in a (former) stem cell clone that no longer extends back to the Region 2a/2b border. These can be difficult to distinguish from FSC clones unless they are very big (e.g. clearly spanning three or more consecutive follicles). However, <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> clones that originate from an FSC should have a polarity phenotype, yet only 5\u20136% of <i>Egfr</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> prefollicle cell clones scored at 4\u20137 dpci had polarity defects (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that this type of \u2018false\u2019 transient clone is uncommon at these time points."

Ovaries were dissected in Graces medium (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA) using tungsten needles and carefully transferred to microfuge tubes with forceps or a tungsten needle. To minimize mechanical damage, ovarioles were never aspirated with a pipette. Ovarioles were fixed in 1\u00d7 PBS + 4% paraformaldehyde diluted from 16% (Fisher) for 15 min, rinsed, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissues were then rinsed and washed for 1 hr, incubated with secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 hr, rinsed and washed for 1 hr, rinsed in 1\u00d7 PBS, and mounted in Vectashield plus DAPI (Vector Labs) on glass slides. 1\u00d7 PBST (PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100) was used for all antibody dilutions, rinses and washes except where indicated otherwise. All images were acquired on a Zeiss M2 Axioimager with Apotome unit or Leica TCS SP5 spectral confocal. For multicolor fluorescence images, each channel was acquired separately. Images were stored as JPEG files and post-acquisition processing, such as adjustments of brightness, rotations and cropping, was performed with Adobe Photoshop."

First, there is the possibility that some of the clones may be 'false' as recently described by the St Johnston lab. Second, it is not clear how they distinguish between stem cell clones and prefollicle cell clones in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3 and 4</a>, given that many of the mutant stem cells are lost, so one cannot always identify the former by the presence of a GFP-negative FSC. Third, only a single allele of each mutation has been tested and there is a risk of contaminating mutations. This is somewhat abrogated by the use of lambda-top, but here, too, only a single insertion was tested. The DN-EGFR, Ras85D and LKB1 effects were rather weak."

The authors should be more circumspect; it is probably premature to describe everything in terms of a simple linear pathway through LKB1. Furthermore, the strong statement that \u201cThe EGFR is required for FSC self-renewal\u201d is misleading, as half of the <i>Egfr\u2013</i> FSC clones persist for 11 days. During this time, they must go through multiple rounds of asymmetric division to produce a daughter stem cell and a prefollicle cell, that is, self-renew. What the authors are referring to is the observation that mutant stem cells cannot replace their counterparts on the other side of the germarium, which is stem cell replacement, not self-renewal."

For example, we state in the Discussion section \u201cSeveral lines of evidence indicate that EGFR signaling regulates cell polarity <i>in part</i> by activating LKB1\u201d and go on to point out that \u201cconstitutively active LKB1 <i>partially</i> rescues the phenotypes caused by a decrease in <i>Egfr</i> function\u201d. This discussion continues in the following paragraph, where we describe the bifurcation model using language that emphasizes our uncertainty, such as \u201cit is possible that,\u201d \u201csuggests,\u201d and \u201cconsistent with this possibility\u201d. Also, in the next paragraph of the same section, we discuss the many ways that the phosphorylation of Erk may directly regulate the activity of genes in the FSC self-renewal program. We hope this is an effective way of communicating our views without overstating them."
