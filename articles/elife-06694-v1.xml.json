Here, we examine how signals experienced during free olfactory behaviors are processed by first-order olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the <i>Drosophila</i> larva. We find that OSNs can act as differentiators that transiently normalize stimulus intensity\u2014a property potentially derived from a combination of integral feedback and feed-forward regulation of olfactory transduction. In olfactory virtual reality experiments, we report that high activity levels of the OSN suppress turning, whereas low activity levels facilitate turning. Using a generalized linear model, we explain how peripheral encoding of olfactory stimuli modulates the probability of switching from a run to a turn. Our work clarifies the link between computations carried out at the sensory periphery and action selection underlying navigation in odor gradients."

Here, we examine how signals experienced during free olfactory behaviors are processed by first-order olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the <i>Drosophila</i> larva. We find that OSNs can act as differentiators that transiently normalize stimulus intensity\u2014a property potentially derived from a combination of integral feedback and feed-forward regulation of olfactory transduction. In olfactory virtual reality experiments, we report that high activity levels of the OSN suppress turning, whereas low activity levels facilitate turning. Using a generalized linear model, we explain how peripheral encoding of olfactory stimuli modulates the probability of switching from a run to a turn. Our work clarifies the link between computations carried out at the sensory periphery and action selection underlying navigation in odor gradients."

In bacteria, chemotaxis allows individual cells to detect the presence of food and to accumulate in its vicinity. Multicellular organisms have evolved complex sensory systems to track temporal changes in the concentration of volatile odorant molecules relevant to their survival\u2014food odors, pheromones associated with the presence of conspecifics and substances signaling danger. In turn, sensory perception drives behavioral strategies to forage, locate a mating partner and actively avoid danger (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fraenkel and Gunn, 1961</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Sch\u00f6ne, 1984</a>). Bacterial chemotaxis represents the archetype of orientation behavior in unicellular organisms: phases of relatively straight motion\u2014called <i>runs</i>\u2014alternate with changes in orientation\u2014called <i>tumbles</i>\u2014that randomize the direction of the next run (<a href=\"#bib8\">Berg, 2004</a>). Accumulation near the source of an attractive chemical results from the elongation of runs in the direction of the gradient. In multicellular organisms, olfactory behaviors have been investigated in detail in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bargmann, 2006a</a>), which uses a combination of undirected turns (\u2018pirouettes\u2019) and continuous correction of the orientation of individual runs (\u2018weathervaning\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Lockery, 2011</a>). The neural computations enabling animals with a central nervous system to orient in odor gradients, however, remain poorly understood."

The larva achieves robust odor gradient ascents through an alternation of approximately straight runs and turning events (<a href=\"#bib37\">Gomez-Marin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gershow et al., 2012</a>). The duration of runs is modulated by the sensory input: runs up the gradient are elongated while runs away from it are shortened (<a href=\"#bib37\">Gomez-Marin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gershow et al., 2012</a>). Although published results hint at how larval chemotaxis may be achieved (<a href=\"#bib35\">Gomez-Marin and Louis, 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2014</a>), a quantitative model of the underlying sensorimotor integration is still missing. Here, we focus on the primary task of the orientation algorithm common to bacteria, <i>C. elegans</i>, and <i>Drosophila</i>: the control of run duration (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bargmann, 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Lockery, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gomez-Marin and Louis, 2012</a>).

Here, we rely on this simplification to develop a novel larval preparation in which the neural computations underlying odor gradient ascent can be understood in unprecedented detail. We used optogenetics in larvae with a single type of functional OSNs to substitute turbulent olfactory signals with well-controlled light stimulations (<a href=\"#bib91\">Suh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bellmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Smear et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gaudry et al., 2013</a>). This allowed us to characterize the modulatory effects of OSN firing patterns on the probability of switching from a run to a turn. Toward this goal, we developed a novel tracker to create virtual olfactory realities (<a href=\"#bib54\">Kocabas et al., 2012</a>) in which optogenetic stimulations of genetically targeted OSNs are defined based on the behavioral history of the larva. We used this technology to derive a phenomenological model of the OSN transfer function. The model was validated on free behavior in sensory landscapes designed to produce predictable sensorimotor responses, and ultimately, it was found to be applicable to real odor gradients. We found that for positive gradients, the OSN operates as a slope detector: its activity increases with the stimulus derivative, which suppresses the probability of turning. For strongly negative gradients, the OSN acts like an OFF detector: the inhibition of the neural activity facilitates turning in a nearly deterministic manner. Altogether, our results advance our understanding of how peripheral odor encoding guides action selection during chemotaxis."

We examined the behavior of larvae with a single functional OSN expressing Or42a, an odorant receptor with a well-characterized tuning profile that includes the odorant isoamyl acetate (IAA) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fishilevich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Kreher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Asahina et al., 2009</a>).

For large odor droplets, diffusion from the source creates a radially symmetric gradient that can be approximated by a stationary Gaussian distribution (<a href=\"#bib65\">Louis et al., 2008</a>). For smaller odor droplets such as those used in the present study, the temporal evolution of the odor gradient cannot be neglected. We therefore combined infrared spectroscopy (IR) and a partial differential equation (PDE) model to experimentally reconstruct the two-dimensional geometry of the odor gradient over time (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

In an exponential ramp, the stimulus derivative increased throughout the rising phase of the ramp. This acceleration correlated with a continuous increase in spiking activity. To further test the hypothesis that the OSN encodes features related to the slope of the stimulus, we examined a sigmoid ramp (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, right panel) for which the first derivative of the stimulus reached its maximum (gray arrow) prior to the stimulus intensity (magenta arrow). Consistent with the slope-sensitivity hypothesis, the OSN spiking activity peaked with the first derivative and not the absolute intensity of the stimulus. During the falling phase of the ramps, the OSN firing rate behaved in a way that could not be predicted from the slope sensitivity observed during the rising phase. At the end of the falling phase, OSN activity decreased below baseline (star signs * in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), suggesting offset inhibition similar to that observed in OSNs of adult flies (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hallem et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Nagel and Wilson, 2011</a>).

Integral feedback control underlies perfect adaption in bacterial chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib104\">Yi et al., 2000</a>). In vertebrates, the olfactory transduction cascade involves a metabotropic pathway downstream from a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that features negative regulatory feedback (<a href=\"#bib49\">Kaupp, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Pifferi et al., 2010</a>). As with phototransduction, adaptive features of the olfactory transduction cascade in vertebrate can be accounted for by integral feedback (<a href=\"#bib22\">De Palo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">De Palo et al., 2013</a>). Even though invertebrate olfaction does not rely on GPCR signaling (<a href=\"#bib49\">Kaupp, 2010</a>), the existence of negative feedback on the odorant receptor has been postulated for olfactory transduction in adult-fly OSNs (<a href=\"#bib76\">Nagel and Wilson, 2011</a>). This conclusion was drawn from a biophysical model that combined a linear filter accounting for the OSN spiking dynamics with a kinetic formalism to describe ligand\u2013receptor interactions. Research in the moth has revealed a different regulatory mechanism that constitutes an \u2018incoherent feed-forward\u2019 loop (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alon, 2007</a>) in which the activity of the odorant receptor has a dual effect on the OSN spike rate (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gu et al., 2009</a>): (1) on a short timescale, the inflow of cations increases the firing rate; (2) on a longer timescale increasing concentration of intracellular calcium ions inhibits the OSN firing rate through a pathway that involves the binding of calcium to calmodulin."

In what follows, this composite model will be denoted as IFB+IFF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Bi</a>). Using a mass-action-kinetics formalism originally developed for genetic networks (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ackers et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bintu et al., 2005</a>), each of the two regulatory motifs was described by a system of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with three variables (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Bii</a>): <i>x</i>, the stimulus strength (input: odor concentration or light intensity), <i>y</i> the instantaneous firing rate of the OSN (output), and <i>u</i>, a phenomenological variable that might represent the intracellular concentration of calcium. The free parameters of the model were determined through a simplex algorithm which optimized the fit between the experimental spiking activity of the <i>Or42a</i>&gt;ChR2 OSN and that produced by the ODE model. The optimization was achieved on a set of 10 linear and nonlinear ramps listed in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> together with the naturalistic stimulus presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>. The parameter set derived from the 10 odor ramps and naturalistic stimulus (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) led to a remarkably good fit between the output of the ODE model and the experimentally measured spiking activity (experimental peristimulus time histogram PSTH\u2014black line, results of the IFF+IFB model\u2014blue line; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Throughout the study, this parameter set was used to reproduce and predict the OSN spiking activity elicited by olfactory stimuli. To rule out over-fitting, we trained the IFF+IFB model on a partial dataset containing the linear ramps alone and validated its response against other stimuli not present in the training dataset (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The contribution of the IFB motif to the dynamics of variable <i>u</i> is approximately 30% that of the IFF (cyan vs magenta curves, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This led us to conclude that the IFF pathway dominates the control of OSN spiking activity. The IFB pathway has nonetheless a non-negligible impact on the dynamics. Using the parameter optimization procedure, the pure IFF model was trained on the full set of odor ramps (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, middle column).

In this regime, the temporal pattern of the OSN activity elicited by the light ramps was comparable to that elicited by the odor ramps (experimental PSTH\u2014black lines, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This close similarity in the input\u2013output relationships permitted us to substitute the odor stimulus with light. Using the full set of linear and nonlinear light ramps together with a naturalistic pattern of light stimulation (Figure 6B), optimization of the parameters of the ODE system showed that the IFB pathway does not contribute to the light-evoked response dynamics of the OSN, suggesting that the integral feedback motif is specific to the odor-evoked activity (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The results of the pure IFF model are in good agreement with the experimental observations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Notably, the goodness of fit of the pure IFF motif, when applied to both light and odor stimulations, was comparable (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In conclusion, the nonlinear-dynamical response properties of the OSN stimulated by odor and light ramps can be well approximated by the IFF motif, even though the IFB motif brings a non-negligible contribution to the modeling of odor-evoked response dynamics."

The general solution of the IFF motif required solving the ODE system shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Bii</a>.

In addition, we experimentally observed that (4) the spiking activity of the neuron is strongly inhibited upon abrupt return to the stimulus baseline. We asked whether these features bore any relevance to the control of run-to-turn transitions during odor gradient ascent. We hypothesized that sustained spiking activity of the OSN would suppress turning while inhibition of the OSN would facilitate turning. To test this hypothesis, we built a tracker to monitor the position and behavioral state of a single larva in real-time at a rate of 30 Hz (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and detailed description in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Equipped with blue LEDs, the tracker was designed to evoke controlled patterns of spiking activity in the <i>Or42a</i>&gt;ChR2 OSN by means of optogenetics. To avoid innate photophobic behavior (<a href=\"#bib86\">Sawin-McCormack et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kane et al., 2013</a>), experiments were conducted on blind larvae (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

Illustrative runs denoted as R1-4 are interspaced by turns T1-3 denoted by arrows. (<b>C</b>) Turn probability estimated from a set of runs associated with constant stimulation (light gray) or stimulation by an exponential light ramp (black). The turn probabilities are reported as the fraction of turns occurring during a 1-s window centered on the time point of interest (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Error bars are estimated from resampled sets of runs (shaded areas denote standard deviation, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The dashed line depicts the mean turning rate computed for constant light stimulation. The turning rate is in first approximation independent of the run duration. Small disks on the <i>x</i>-axis indicate time points after which fewer than 10% of the total number of runs are left for the constant stimulation (light gray) and exponential ramp (dark gray). Beyond these time points, the estimates of the turn probability should be considered as unreliable. (<b>D</b>) Generalized linear model (GLM) for the modulation of turn probability as a function of the sensory experience (integrated stimulus-to-behavior model). The turn probability is predicted from a linear combination of the predicted neural activity (<i>\u03b3</i><sub><i>1</i></sub> <i>y</i> (<i>t</i>)) and a constant term (\u03b3<sub>0</sub>). This linear combination is then fed into a logit transformation to convert the domain of definition of the neural activity into a probability. The two parameters of the model, <i>\u03b3</i><sub><i>0</i></sub> and <i>\u03b3</i><sub><i>1</i></sub>, are determined from a linear regression on the experimental profiles of turn probability. The OSN activity driven by light, <i>y</i>, is predicted from the pure IFF (ODE) model described in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>.

In the example shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, we began each run with either an exponential ramp or a constant basal light intensity (internal control). When an exponential ramp was played to the larva, the pattern of light stimulation was executed as long as the larva remained in a run state.

The turn probability was estimated at every time point by using a sliding window. Upon constant light stimulation, we found that the instantaneous turn probability was largely independent of the duration of the ongoing run (light gray line, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In contrast, the turn probability was strongly modulated by the exponential light ramp (black line, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). During the rising phase of the ramp (0\u20138 s), turning was suppressed below the value corresponding to basal stimulation. Conversely, a sharp increase in turn probability was observed during the falling phase of the ramp. The modulation of the turn probability by the light-evoked spiking activity corroborated the idea that strong activation of the OSN efficiently suppresses turning, whereas inhibition promotes turning."

The spiking activity of the OSN displayed considerable processing of the stimulation pattern. This transformation of the stimulus was well captured by the IFF model. To predict the temporal evolution of the turn probability associated with individual runs, we fed the predicted spiking activity of the OSN into the GLM trained on the open-loop light ramps (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Correlating the predictions of the model with the termination of the actual runs revealed that the initiation of a turn was typically preceded by a steady increase in the predicted probability of turning (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). To quantify this trend, we analyzed a large set of runs included in 25 trajectories, each trajectory corresponding to a different animal (representation of a subset of 10 trajectories in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Since every run corresponded to a unique sensory experience, the predictions of the stimulus-to-behavior GLM could only pertain to the average behavior observed over multiple runs. We therefore analyzed the averaged trend of the turn probability preceding individual turns."

Accordingly, the stimulus-to-behavior GLM predicted that the stimulus downslope was transformed into a monotonic increase in turn probability (light blue line, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). To establish the sensorimotor control underlying this trend, we computed the turn-triggered averages of the turn probability by using two control models (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019): (1) behavioral predictions based on the assumption that the OSN spiking activity remained constant throughout the trajectory and (2) behavioral predictions upon uncoupling of the stimulus and the behavior by temporally inverting the reconstructed time course of the stimulus. In contrast to the test GLM, neither control displayed a substantial increase in turn probability prior to turning (red and back dashed lines, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). The significance of the improvement in the predictive power of the test model relative to the controls was established by comparing the log-likelihood computed over the entire set of runs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6F</a>, bottom panel and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). This allowed us to conclude that the integrated neural-to-behavior model built on controlled conditions of stimulation (open-loop paradigm) was sufficient to predict run-to-turn transitions arising from free behavior in a virtual odor gradient (closed-loop paradigm)."

To this end, we designed radially symmetrical light landscapes with geometrical features producing inhibition or maintenance of OSN activity during free motion. As a control, we considered a landscape with an exponential rise interrupted by an exponential fall at a fixed distance of 8 mm from the center (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, top panel, \u2018rim\u2019 indicated by a dashed line). The shape of this landscape is reminiscent of a \u2018volcano\u2019. The geometry of the landscape was chosen such that a larva moving at a speed of 1 mm/s from the foot of the gradient toward its center would experience a light pattern similar to the 8-s exponential ramp (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7Ai</a>). In response to an exponential ramp, the spiking activity of the OSN featured a steady increase followed by a rapid decrease. We therefore expected to observe turn suppression during the rising phase of the ramp and turn facilitation during the falling phase of the ramp. The tendency of larvae to initiate turning upon crossing of the volcano's rim was evident from the set of runs that moved from the outer to the inner edge of the volcano (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7Aii</a>, bottom panel). The alternation between turn suppression and turn facilitation resulted in a zigzagging of trajectories across the rim of the volcano. The integrated stimulus-to-behavior GLM predicted a rise in the turn probability prior to the interruption of a run (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

In this landscape, the light intensity experienced by a larva moving toward the center of the well corresponded to an exponential rise followed by a near-instantaneous drop. The IFF model correctly reproduced the strong inhibitory phase experimentally observed in the OSN spiking activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7Bi</a>, bottom panel). This inhibition was expected to generate a nearly deterministic release of turns. Consistently, larvae avoided the well region (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7Bii</a>). Such a behavior was correctly described by the GLM, which predicted a dramatic increase in turn probability following the crossing of the rim (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). To probe the idea that sustained OSN spiking activity suppresses turning, we synthesized a landscape complementary to the well: a \u2018mesa\u2019 in which the light intensity at the rim was extended to the central area of the landscape (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). During the transition from an exponential rise in light intensity to a plateau value, the OSN underwent a mild drop in spiking activity before a stationary value was reached\u2014a feature accurately reproduced by the IFF motif (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7Ci</a>).

The well was associated with the prediction of the steepest increase in turn probability, leading to the expectation that most runs stopped within 2 s of the rim crossing. The volcano led to a milder increase in the predicted turn probability for about 3 s, while the mesa and linear hat were predicted to generate an even weaker increase. As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>, we found that the average latency to turn was shortest for the well landscape (0.93 s) followed by the volcano (3.48 s). We observed significantly longer turn latencies for the mesa and linear hat with no difference between the two conditions (6.6 s and 6.7 s, respectively). In conclusion, the use of synthetic light landscapes permitted us to experimentally demonstrate that sustained OSN spiking activity suppresses turning during free behavior, whereas inhibition of the OSN activity promotes run-to-turn transitions in a nearly deterministic manner. This approach established that the relatively simple linear control underlying the GLM trained on the behavior of larvae experiencing stereotyped open-loop light stimulations is sufficient to account for the control of behavior elicited under conditions of closed-loop light stimulation."

In a real odor landscape (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), larvae accumulated at the peak of the gradient with a dispersal notably larger than that observed in a light gradient (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This apparent decrease in orientation performances can be partly explained by the shallower geometry of the odor gradient (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, the goodness of fit between the spiking activity of the OSN and the output of the IFF+IFB model can be appreciated for the representative trajectory highlighted in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> (magenta trace). To predict run-to-turn transitions during free motion in a real odor gradient, we replaced the pure IFF model devised for light-evoked spiking activity by the composite IFF+IFB model as input for the stimulus-to-behavior GLM trained on the open-loop light ramps (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). The model predicted that runs were on average associated with a monotonic increase in the turn probability during several seconds before a turn (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Based on these predictions, we computed the likelihood of the ensemble of runs observed in the odor gradient. This likelihood was significantly larger than that computed for two control models (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Together, these results establish that the structure and parameters of the integrated stimulus-to-behavior GLM form a solid conceptual basis to describe how the sensory dynamics of single OSNs influence run-to-turn transitions during naturalistic behavior (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>)."

The odor gradient shown in the background corresponds to the reconstructed snapshot 60 s after the onset of the diffusion process (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). (<b>B</b>) Sensorimotor analysis of a representative trajectory. (Top) Time course of the reconstructed odor concentration associated with the trajectory displayed in panel <b>A</b>. (Center) PSTH of the OSN measured experimentally in response to a replay of the odor concentration course (black line). Neural activity simulated by the composite IFF+IFB ODE model (blue line) presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> (parameter set listed in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). (Bottom) Turn probability (blue line) predicted by the stimulus-to-behavior GLM trained on the light-evoked open-loop behavior reported in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (parameter set listed in <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). The neural activity simulated in the middle panel is fed into the GLM to predict the turn probability shown in the bottom panel. Behavioral predictions are only shown for the sequences associated with runs. The predicted turn probability is only shown for the behavioral sequences associated with runs. (<b>C</b>) Turn-triggered average of the predicted probability of turning for behavior observed in the odor gradient. A comparison is made between predictions based on the simulated OSN activity driven by the stimulus intensity (coupled test, blue), predictions based on the simulated OSN activity driven by the time-reversed stimulus time courses (uncoupled control, black), and predictions based on the assumption that the neural activity stays constant over the course of each trajectory (constant control, red). As for the light gradient, we observe that the predicted turn probability increases 5 s before the turn, which coincides with the median duration (5.4 s) of the entire set of runs. Since the geometry of the odor gradient is shallower than the light gradient (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the increase in turn probability has a reduced amplitude compared to the behavior elicited by the light gradient (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Shaded areas denote SEM. (<b>D</b>) Log-likelihood of the predictions of the integrated stimulus-to-behavior GLM compared to the controls. Bootstrap analysis of the difference in log-likelihood (logL) of the test model and the controls normalized by the log-likelihood of the test model (\u0394logL/logL<sub>test</sub>). Distribution of the relative difference in logL computed for the test model against itself (blue), against the constant neural activity control (red), and against the uncoupled stimulus control (gray). The median of the distribution is equal to the value obtained from the original full set of runs; the median of the entire distribution is indicated by a dot in the x-axis. Based on 10,000 resampled subsets of runs, we conclude that the test model is significantly larger than both controls (p = 0.0001 for the constant neural activity control and the uncoupled stimulus control). For panels <b>C</b> and <b>D</b>, the analysis includes all runs with a duration of minimum 1 s (304 runs originating from 20 trajectories)."

A similar specialization into ON-OFF detection pathways has been observed for thermotaxis in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib92\">Suzuki et al., 2008</a>) and motion perception in adult flies (<a href=\"#bib45\">Joesch et al., 2010</a>). In contrast with these binary sensory responses, we discovered that a single larval OSN is sensitive to both the stimulus intensity and its first derivative. The enhanced information-processing capacity of primary olfactory neurons in the larva is consistent with the response characteristics of OSNs in adult flies, which encode complex dynamical features of airborne odorant stimuli (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Martelli et al., 2013</a>)."

IFB motifs constitute the core mechanism of chemoreception in bacteria, olfactory transduction, and phototransduction (<a href=\"#bib104\">Yi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">De Palo et al., 2013</a>). In adult flies, <a href=\"#bib76\">Nagel and Wilson (2011)</a> investigated how the potential involvement of negative feedback on the olfactory transduction cascade could account for dynamical and adaptive features of OSN response. On the other hand, IFF motifs are implicated in the regulation of numerous cellular and developmental processes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Goentoro and Kirschner, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Lim et al., 2013</a>), and their contribution to sensory processing has been documented in recent work (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kato et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). These results led us to conjecture that two regulatory motifs might be involved in larval olfactory transduction: an IFB and an IFF featuring direct excitation and indirect inhibition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Using a parameter optimization approach, we found that a pure IFF motif is sufficient to approximate the response properties of the OSN. Combining the IFF and IFB motifs was nonetheless necessary to recapitulate the richness of OSN dynamics elicited by naturalistic olfactory stimuli (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with the model proposed by <a href=\"#bib76\">Nagel and Wilson (2011)</a>, our numerical simulations indicate that the integral feedback applies to the signaling pathway specific to the odorant receptor (OR). Nagel and Wilson have suggested that a diffusible effector\u2014potentially intracellular calcium\u2014inhibits the activity of the OR, thereby affecting the onset and offset kinetics of the OSN response. By contrast, the IFF motif would describe a regulatory mechanism acting on components of the transduction pathway downstream from the OR (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gu et al., 2009</a>). It is plausible that the IFF regulation is also mediated by intracellular calcium."

Our biophysical model of the olfactory transduction cascade shows that the spiking activity of the OSN follows a standard hyperbolic dose-response when stimulated by prolonged pulses of odor (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In this regime, the maximum OSN firing rate we observed for IAA is modest (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Changes in odor concentration occurring on a timescale relevant to the behavior\u2014a second or shorter\u2014can produce significantly higher (or lower) firing rates. This sensitivity to positive and negative changes in stimulus intensity can be explained by the mathematical solution we derived for the OSN dynamics (<a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>). Upon changes in odor concentration, the dose\u2013response function describing the OSN spiking activity is transiently rescaled (or \u2018normalized\u2019) by the short-term history of the stimulus derivative (\u2018memory\u2019 on characteristic time scale of 1 s, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). As a result, positive derivatives in stimulus intensity excite the OSN. Negative derivatives can inhibit the OSN firing rate in a manner consistent with the stimulus-offset inhibitions observed in adult-fly OSNs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hallem et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Nagel and Wilson, 2011</a>). Our model indicates that a single <i>Or42a</i> OSN combines the function of a slope (ON) detector in response to positive gradients and an OFF detector in response to negative gradients. When larvae ascend Gaussian odor gradients originating from single odor sources, we thus expect high OSN firing rates. Robust inhibition of OSN spiking activity would result from motion that takes larvae down the odor gradient."

Under the conditions of open-loop light stimulation, we found that OFF responses (offset inhibition of the OSN firing) promote turning, whereas ON responses (sustained high firing) suppress turning (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). We applied a GLM to describe the link between the OSN spiking dynamics and the probability of switching from a run to a turn (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The accuracy of the model's output showed a striking dependence on the nonlinear transformation achieved by the olfactory transduction cascade (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

By exploiting the sufficiency of a single OSN to direct larval chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fishilevich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Louis et al., 2008</a>), we developed a mathematical model accounting for the transformation of time-varying stimuli into the firing rate of an OSN and the conversion of dynamical patterns of OSN activity into the selection between two basic types of action\u2014running and turning. It will be interesting to examine the validity of the present model for the sensorimotor control of other aspects of larval chemotaxis such as turn orientation through lateral head casts (casting-to-turn transitions). In adult flies, turn orientation is determined by the crossing of the boundaries of odor plumes: upon encountering of an odor plume, flies veer upwind whereas exiting the plume initiates lateral and vertical casting (<a href=\"#bib97\">van Breugel and Dickinson, 2014</a>)\u2014an orientation strategy related to the surge-and-cast response of moths (<a href=\"#bib15\">Carde and Willis, 2008</a>). To orient in a rapidly changing olfactory landscape, the OSNs of various flying insects are capable of tracking rapid odor pulses on sub-second timescales and differentiating these signals (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Fujiwara et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Szyszka et al., 2014</a>). Whether the processing of turbulent olfactory inputs involves more temporal integration than that described by the sensorimotor model proposed here remains to be elucidated. Finally, the <i>Drosophila</i> larva offers a unique opportunity to delineate the neural circuit basis of behavior (<a href=\"#bib78\">Ohyama et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib79\">2015</a>). Interdisciplinary approaches combining behavioral screens, functional imaging, and circuit reconstruction on the one hand (<a href=\"#bib103\">Yao et al., 2012</a>), and computational modeling and robotics on the other hand (<a href=\"#bib38\">Grasso et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Webb, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Izquierdo and Lockery, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ando et al., 2013</a>), should improve our understanding of how brains with reduced numerical complexity exploit streams of sensory information to direct action selection."

Due to the use of an odor source with reduced volume, this approximation did not hold in the present study. To correlate the behavior of the larva with a more accurate reconstruction of the odor gradient, we developed a physical model for the diffusion of the odor inside the behavioral arena (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). We used model-based estimation techniques for parameters underlying this physical model. We considered 3D diffusion with separate diffusion constants for air and the droplet. Exposed plastic surfaces of the chamber were treated as adsorptive boundaries. Since the odor gradient was initially established in the arena for 30 s prior to the introduction of a larva, our model also included non-zero initial concentration of the odor in the air, agarose, and plastic chamber. COMSOL Multiphysics v4.3 (COMSOL, Burlington, MA) was used to solve the diffusion equation with these boundary conditions. Parameter estimation was performed using the MATLAB/Optimization toolbox (MathWorks, Natick, MA) by solving a nonlinear least squares problem that matched the simulated odor concentration to measurements at the same time points."

The arena consists of a square shaped transparent plastic box with a side length of 120 mm and a height of 12 mm. The lid is inverted on a surface of agarose. The odor source consists of a solution of isoamyl acetate mixed with paraffin oil. A droplet of 3 \u03bcl of odor is placed inside a transparent reinforcement ring of a radius <i>r</i><sub>ring</sub>. This volume fills the ring evenly and, upon inversion of the lid on an agarose slab, the droplet remains suspended due to surface tension. The droplet shape is modeled as a spherical cap. The flat face of the droplet is in contact with the top plastic lid. The volume <i>v</i><sub>drop</sub> of the droplet is related to the radius of the flat face <i>r</i><sub>ring</sub> and the droplet height <i>h</i><sub>drop</sub> according to the formula of a sphere. The agarose layer at the bottom of the chamber is modeled as a two-dimensional sheet with an independent diffusion constant. The top flat face of the droplet that contacts the plastic cap is treated as a no-flux boundary, and flux continuity is imposed on the spherical interface with air. The remaining boundaries, air-agarose and air-plastic, are modeled as Robin boundary conditions to accommodate the possibility of adsorption-desorption at these boundaries. The establishment of the odor gradient in the arena is modeled by two simultaneous diffusion processes, both of which are described by partial differential equation (PDE): \u2202<i>x</i>(<i>r</i>\u20d1, <i>t</i>)/\u2202<i>t</i> = <i>D</i> \u2207<sup>2</sup><i>x</i>(<i>r</i>\u20d1, <i>t</i>) where <i>x</i>(<i>r</i>\u20d1, <i>t</i>) denotes the odor concentration at position <i>r</i>\u20d1 and time <i>t</i>. The diffusion constant D depends on whether the medium is air or the odor droplet. We used a flux continuity condition at the droplet-air boundary. For additional details about the model, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. (<b>B</b>) As described in <a href=\"#bib65\">Louis et al. (2008)</a>, infrared spectroscopy was used to estimate the absorbance and thereby the average concentration along sections of the arena (IR beam depicted in panel <b>A</b>). The time course of the cumulated concentration was determined for 7 sections at a distance from the source ranging from 0 to 45 mm (only first 6 are shown in the graph). Each concentration profile results from an average over 2 to 4 independent measurements. The absorbance was measured for a source concentration of 1.0 M. As discussed in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, the parameters of the model are estimated by optimizing the fit of the model with the average concentration profiles along the 7 sections of the arena. The parameters of the model are reported in <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>. The PDE model leads to a good fit of the temporal profiles of the average concentrations after an initial transient phase of 30 s. (<b>C</b>) Assessment of variability in the concentration estimates at a fixed position of the center of the 1.0 M odor source (7.5 mm). Mean concentration obtained from four independent infrared measurements. Error bars denote standard deviation. The time course of the simulated concentration is shown as a dashed line.

We used a flux continuity condition at the droplet-air boundary, that is, the odorant could not accumulate at this boundary. As a result of the flux continuity at the droplet-air boundary, and because diffusion through air was substantially faster than through the droplet, the odor developed a radial profile within the droplet despite starting with a homogenous initial concentration. This process is our approximation of the coupled evaporation-diffusion process. Modeling the diffusion limited evaporation process (<a href=\"#bib50\">Kelly-Zion et al., 2011</a>) would render this problem intractable in the context of our model-based parameter estimation. We, therefore, used an approximation for the evaporation process. Although inaccuracies could arise from this approximation because we ignored natural convection and concentration-dependent changes in volatility of the odorant arising from chemical interactions with the solvent, our model was able to match experimental measurements with good fidelity as seen from the results of our model-based estimation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013D</a>)."

The quantities of odor tested were 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 \u03bcl. In all cases, the absorbance was measured by calculating the height of the absorption peak at the wave number 1765 cm<sup>\u22121</sup>\u2014a wavelength specific to IAA. Between trials, the gas flow cell was disassembled and all parts were rinsed with n-hexane. The absorption coefficient was estimated to be 479.87 M<sup>\u22121</sup>cm<sup>\u22121</sup> at 25\u00b0C. The concentration of saturated odor was estimated by injecting 10 \u03bcl of pure IAA into the gas-flow cell. The absorbance saturated at a value close to 1.36. Using the absorption coefficient, the concentration of the saturated vapor was estimated to be 278.45 \u03bcM."

As described in (<a href=\"#bib65\">Louis et al., 2008</a>), the average odor concentration along the light path was estimated using the Beer\u2013Lambert law. Based on this, we defined the parameters of the PDE model by characterizing the geometry of the gradient produced by a single odor source of 3 \u03bcl of IAA at a concentration of 1.0 M. A higher source concentration was used for the infrared spectroscopic measurements than for the behavioral experiments (0.25 M) to ensure the accuracy of the concentration estimates. We measured the absorbance along sections located at distances 0 mm, 7.5 mm, 15 mm, 22.5 mm, 30 mm, 37.5 mm, and 45 mm from the center of the droplet (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013D</a>). The measurements were taken after the odorant was placed in the chamber following the exact same protocol as for the behavioral experiments. From these, we inferred the average concentration at these 7 sections over a time interval of 360 s. For a given set of parameters based on an initial guess about the order of magnitude, we simulated the diffusion process. To this end, we used trapezoidal integration to estimate the average of the concentration along the sections that corresponded to the experimental measurements. The objective function to be minimized for estimating the parameters was the root-mean-squared error of the average concentration at each of the seven locations and at all times."

At this low concentration and due to the small volume of the source, accurate temporal profiles of the average odor concentration could not be obtained through infrared spectroscopy for all sections of the plate. Under the source, we find that the average concentration of the odor scales as a function of the source concentration. We therefore assume that the gradient obtained for a 0.25 M source can be approximated by the gradient reconstructed at 1.0 M scaled by a factor 0.25. (<b>B</b>) Numerical integration of the PDE model (parameter set listed in <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>) permits us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the odor gradient experienced by the larva at arbitrary spatiotemporal precision. Due to practical considerations, the reconstruction was saved at time steps of 1 s. As on the time scale of 1 s the geometry of the gradient does not evolve considerably, a linear interpolation is applied between defined sections of the gradient. Over time, the gradient tends to flatten out. This effect is due to the gradual depletion of the source. It is worth noting that in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib65\">Louis et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Asahina et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Gomez-Marin et al., 2011</a>), the gradients generated by a single odor source could be approximated as roughly constant. In these configurations, the enhanced stability of the gradient was due to the larger volume of the odor source (10 \u03bcl) and the reduced dimension of the behavioral arenas. (<b>C</b>) Reconstruction of the concentration time course experienced during the trajectory displayed in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. The magenta trace was obtained after mapping the behavior onto the dynamical reconstruction of the gradient shown in panel <b>B</b>. In contrast, the blue trace was obtained after mapping the behavior onto a static gradient computed 60 s after the onset of the odor diffusion. The differences between the two temporal profiles highlight the importance of the dynamical reconstruction for the experimental conditions in the present study."

In the <i>Orco</i> null background, spontaneous activity of OSNs is drastically reduced but not abolished (<a href=\"#bib42\">Hoare et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, non-OSNs contribute to the activity monitored from the DO ganglion. We devised an optogenetic spike-sorting strategy to distinguish spikes of the <i>Or42a</i> OSN from other spikes (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B,C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Lima et al., 2009</a>). Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2-H134R) was expressed in the single functional <i>Or42a</i> OSN (<i>Or42a</i>&gt;ChR2). The spike-sorting algorithm (called OpSIN) parsed the extracellular recording data and collected candidate ChR2-evoked spikes specifically during light-activation time windows based on amplitude thresholding and local non-maximum suppression. Template candidates were separated into clusters using an affinity propagation algorithm (<a href=\"#bib28\">Frey and Dueck, 2007</a>). Spike selection was accomplished by comparing candidate waveforms identified throughout the recording to ChR2 derived waveform templates. Candidate waveforms were then transformed to appear as similar as possible to the template waveform via dynamic time warping (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berndt and Clifford, 1994</a>). The probability of spike occurrence at every candidate location was estimated by warping the residual distance between the candidate waveform <i>X</i> and the chosen set of spike templates <i>T</i>."

One barrel was back-filled with the odor solution (IAA dissolved in extracellular saline), and the other with extracellular saline alone. An injection needle (0.51 mm/0.26 mm OD/ID, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was inserted into the back of each barrel and airtight sealed using hot-melt adhesive. Each barrel was subsequently connected to separate channels of a pressure-driven flow controller (Fluigent, France).

More recently, it has been suggested that the response dynamics of OSNs in <i>C. elegans</i> and primary thermosensory neurons in the <i>Drosophila</i> larva are largely linear (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kato et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Klein et al., 2015</a>). We therefore examined whether a linear-nonlinear model could be used to describe the OSN response of the larva. Following a reverse-correlation approach, we stimulated the <i>Or42a</i>&gt;ChR2 OSN by a M-sequence induced with light (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A</a>). Reproducible patterns of neural activity were observed (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13C</a>), from which a biphasic filter was computed (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13B</a>). This filter had a shape similar to those found in retinal ganglion cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chichilnisky, 2001</a>) and insect OSNs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Geffen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Martelli et al., 2013</a>). To test the predictive power of this filter, we reconstructed the activity elicited by an exponential and a sigmoid ramp (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13D,E</a>). Whereas the linear filter led to a reasonable reconstruction of the firing pattern elicited by the M-sequence (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13C</a>), it produced unsatisfactory results for the graded ramps with a mismatch so pronounced that it could not be rectified by a nonlinear function. This conclusion is consistent with the nonlinear response dynamics observed in adult-fly OSNs upon stimulation by graded odor ramps (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kim et al., 2011</a>)."

The M-sequence was based on a discretization of the light intensity range 15\u2013207 W/m<sup>2</sup> into the following 5 values: 15, 50, 100, 150, and 207 W/m<sup>2</sup>. The M-sequence featured all possible 4-element combinations of these 5 intensities. In the experiments, changes in light intensity occurred with time steps of 33 ms. (Bottom, left) PSTH of the neural response computed over 10 trials (10 preparations) and for a bin size of 10 ms. The gray boxes outline a 2-s time window over which the predictions of the linear filter are reported in panel <b>C</b>. (<b>B</b>) Computation of the linear filter, <i>h</i>, through the operations described in panel <b>B</b> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chichilnisky, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Nagel and Wilson, 2011</a>). Function F represents the Fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency domain; F<sup>\u22121</sup> represents the inverse transformation from the frequency domain to the time domain. The bar above the variables in frequency space denotes the complex conjugate transformation. To cancel any DC drifts in the OSN response, the filter was computed on windows of 5-s slid over the entire duration of stimulus (20 s). An average filter was computed from this series (dark blue line). The linear filter was used to make predictions about particular stimulus time courses. (<b>C</b>) Neural activity predicted from the linear filter in response to the M-sequence. The prediction was obtained by convolving the filter with the time course of the stimulus. The resulting activity was normalized to have the same mean as the experimental activity. The result of the prediction is shown for a 2-s window of the complete stimulus (dashed gray box in panel <b>A</b>). The activity predicted from the linear filter (dark blue line) is compared to the output of the IFF (ODE) model introduced in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> (green line). Pearson's correlation coefficient (<i>\u03c1</i>) of the predicted and the experimental activities is 0.37 for the linear filter reconstruction compared to 0.57 for the IFF model.

By trial and error, we also discovered the necessity of including a constitutive decay (offset) term that vanishes at a low firing rate.

For numerical convenience we chose to fix <i>\u03b1</i><sub><i>1</i></sub> = 0.1. To infer the actual value of this parameter, one would need to experimentally access the value of the intermediate variable <i>u</i>, whose molecular identity remains unknown. For the pure IFF model, the number of free parameters is therefore seven. In addition to these parameters, we considered the scaling of the firing rate <i>y</i> elicited by individual stimulation protocols via a multiplicative factor accounting for variability across experimental conditions (e.g., minute differences in the positions of the stimulation pipette)."

For the dataset corresponding to the light stimulation, the fitting procedure led us to rule out the relevance of the IFB model alone with a probability of <i>\u03c7</i><sup>2</sup> very close to zero. In contrast, the IFF was able to reproduce the experimental observation with good accuracy. On the other hand, in the case of the odor stimulation, we obtained a significant improvement of the model fit by adding an IFB component to the IFF motif (addition of the term <i>\u03b1</i><sub>3</sub> <i>y</i> to the dynamics of <i>u</i>)."

We found that the parameter set leading to a good fit during the first 30 s of the light or odor stimulation did not yield an accurate fit for longer durations. By fitting the activity at the beginning and the end of the naturalistic stimulation, we discovered that the discrepancy between both time ranges was mainly due to a change in the threshold <i>\u03b8</i> of the Hill term in the time derivative of <i>y</i> (<a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>)<i>.</i> We therefore allowed the threshold <i>\u03b8</i> to change smoothly between the two different time ranges with the functional expression: <i>\u03b8\u2032 = \u03b8\u00d7</i>(<i>\u03c4/t</i>)<sup>2</sup> for <i>t</i> &gt; <i>\u03c4</i> with <i>\u03c4</i> = 30 s.

It was conceived and built at the Instrumentation Design and Fabrication Facility at the Janelia Research Campus. Part of the construction was carried out by KeyTech (Baltimore, USA). Unlike other tracking systems (<a href=\"#bib24\">Faumont et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Leifer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Kocabas et al., 2012</a>), our setup was designed to keep the stage on which the larva evolves fixed by mounting the camera and stimulation LEDs on a moving stage whose position was continuously updated to stay locked with the animal's position (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15</a>). The upper and lower moving stage were powered by a pair of stepper motors (T-LSR450B, Zaber Technologies, Canada). The blueprint of the tracker and list of parts are available from the following link: <a href=\"https://github.com/LabLouis/eLife_2015/tree/master/Tracker%20Hardware\">https://github.com/LabLouis/eLife_2015/tree/master/Tracker%20Hardware</a>. The light stimulation module consisted of three LEDs, connected in series (LCS-0470-03-22, Mightex Systems) to an LED controller (SLA-1200-2, Mightex Systems) whose output current limit was set to 750 mA. The angle and position of each LED was fixed to cover the camera's field of view with maximum light intensity. The controller's output current scaled proportionally to the analog voltage fed into the controller board. The light intensity reaching the arena was estimated by measuring the current emitted by a photodiode (SM05PD7A, Thorlabs) connected to a benchtop amplifier (PDA200C, Thorlabs). The tracker's video camera (A622f, Basler, Germany) was placed at the center of the three blue LEDs; it delivered images at a resolution of 800 \u00d7 800 pixels at a frame time interval of 23 ms. Combined with the time required to process the image and actuate the position of the stage, the effective frame rate was 30 Hz."

In closed-loop experiments, the LED intensity was updated according to the position of the head with respect to a predefined spatial landscape. In open-loop experiments, the LED intensity was determined by a predefined temporal profile implemented only when a larva was in a run mode (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). During a run, the motion of the larva had no influence on the intensity of the stimulus. As soon as the larva interrupted a run, the light intensity returned to a baseline value (15 W/m<sup>2</sup>).

The flashes were interspaced by a time interval picked from a Poisson distribution with mean 7.7 s. To ensure that a larva had sufficient time to react to individual light pulses, the minimum inter-flash interval was set to 5 s. The behavior resulting from the flash was characterized by computing the flash-triggered averages of the amplitude of the absolute head angle and its time derivative. Wild-type larvae (black trace) display an increase in head motion following the flash (release of head cast). Blind <i>GMR</i>-<i>hid</i>;<i>dTrpA1</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> larvae (red trace) were not affected by the light flashes.

An in-circuit debugging (ICD) Port was used to connect the LTCU to an ICD3 programmable interface controller via a registered jack (RJ11) connector interface, while an USB Port enabled the LTCU's communication to the PC. A customized program written in C was used to direct the function of the LTCU. This C program enabled the LTCU to respond to the commands issued by the PC. The software interface of the tracking and image analysis software interfacing the LTCU was written in JAVA.

Non-run is a meta-state that includes stops, turns, casts, and backward runs. No distinction is made between non-run behaviors. To distinguish runs from non-runs, we defined empirical filters based on the following three sensorimotor features: (1) the head angle between the direction of the body axis (tail-midpoint) and the neck axis (head-midpoint); (2) the instantaneous velocity vector measured at the tail position (vector vtail) and (3) the angle \u03b1 formed by tail velocity vector and the direction of the body axis (unitary vector 1<sub>m</sub>). (<b>B</b>) Transitions from a run to a non-run state take place as soon as (i) the head angle is larger than a threshold <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>1</i></sub> or (ii) the dot product of the tail velocity vector and unitary vector corresponding to the direction of the body axis is smaller than <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>2</i></sub> (condition C1). The first condition on the head angle identifies head casts while the second condition on the dot product identifies sequences of behavior associated with a stop or a backward run. Transitions from a non-run to a run take place when the following two conditions are verified: (iii) the head angle must be lower than the threshold value <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>3</i></sub> and (iv) the dot product of the tail velocity and unitary vector along the body axis must be larger than <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>2</i></sub> (condition C2). (<b>C</b>) The thresholds of conditions (i\u2013iv) were set at a value that maximizes the difference in the cumulative distribution of the run and non-run states along the relevant sensorimotor feature (head angle or dot product) for the two possible types of behavioral state transitions (run \u2192 non-run or non-run \u2192 run). Distributions of the frame-by-frame sensorimotor features were constructed by pooling the annotated frames from four representative trajectories. Manual annotation was achieved by two trained experimenters. (Top) The values of the thresholds used in the analysis were: <i>\u03c4</i><i><sub>1</sub></i> = 18\u00b0, <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>2</i></sub> = 0.0065, and <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>3</i></sub> = 13\u00b0. (Bottom) Comparison of frame-by-frame manual classification of run/non-run behavior achieved by the two trained annotators (A1 and A2) vs the computational classification obtained by filters described in panel <b>B</b>. The table reports the percentage of true positives (frames classified as a run by both the annotator and the algorithm) and false negatives (frames classified as a run by the annotator and a non-run by the algorithm). This good match validates the use of the computational classifiers in real-time experiments."

If we denote the number of runs observed at the beginning and the end of the ith time window as Nb<sub><i>i</i></sub> and Ne<sub><i>i</i></sub>, respectively, Nb1 represents the total number of runs contained in the dataset. Over time, Nb<sub><i>i</i></sub> decreases monotonically to 0. The turn probability associated with the ith time point was estimated as the fraction of runs that ended during the corresponding time window: (Nb<sub><i>i</i></sub> \u2212 Ne<sub><i>i</i></sub>)/Nb<sub><i>i</i></sub>. A sliding time window was then applied to estimate the turn probability corresponding to every time point of the experiment. The turn probability was thus defined as the likelihood of implementing a turn within a 1 s time window, resulting in values smaller than 1 (in the case of 1 all runs entering a given time window switch to a turn) and larger or equal to 0 (in the case of 0 no turn takes place during a given time window). While a short time window led to noisy turn probability estimates, long time windows led to undesirable averaging effects. We empirically found that a time window of 1 s (or 30 time points) offered a good tradeoff."

This average time course was compared to two controls. The first control consisted in achieving turn predictions based on a sensory experience whose relation to the corresponding behavior was uncoupled. To this end, we inverted the time course of the light (odor) intensity and associated it with the forward time course of the behavior. This first control preserved the statistics of the stimulus intensity experienced by the larva. The second control was based on the assumption that the OSN firing rate was constant over time and corresponded to the mean activity predicted by a typical trajectory. Given that each larva experienced a different time course of light intensity, the mean OSN firing rate was computed on a trajectory-by-trajectory basis. Note that the control GLM derived in <a href=\"#equ14\">equation (14)</a> for the open-loop light ramps was deemed inadequate to predict closed-loop behaviors in odor gradients due to the mismatch between the dynamic range of the stimulus associated with the light ramps and that experienced in the odor gradient."

For this reason, the genotype of the larvae used throughout the study for physiological and behavioral quantification resulted from the cross: <i>w</i>;<i>Or42a</i>-Gal4,<i>GMR</i>-<i>hid</i>;<i>Orco</i><sup>2</sup>,<i>dTrpA1</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> \u00d7 <i>w</i>;UAS-<i>Orco</i>,UAS-ChR2-H134R;<i>Orco</i><sup>2</sup>,<i>dTrpA1</i><sup><i>1</i></sup><i>.</i> Given that interneurons of the larval antennal lobe clearly contribute to the neural representation of odors (<a href=\"#bib4\">Asahina et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Larkin et al., 2010</a>), it was important to determine whether the sensorimotor principles controlling chemotactic behavior in a silenced and intact olfactory system are the same. In this aim, we examined the behavior of larvae with ChR2 expressed in the <i>Or42a</i> OSN in the background of a fully functional olfactory system (21 intact OSNs): UAS-ChR2-H134R/<i>Or42a</i>-Gal4;<i>gl</i><sup><i>60j</i></sup>,<i>dTrpA1</i><sup><i>1</i></sup><i>.</i> Larvae bearing the double mutant alleles <i>gl</i><sup><i>60j</i></sup> and <i>dTrpA1</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> were insensitive to light (data not shown). In closed-loop and open-loop conditions of light stimulation, we found a high similarity of the chemotactic responses observed in the background of 1 or 21 functional OSNs (<a href=\"#fig18\">Figure 18</a>). This result corroborates the idea that the basic control principles learned from single functional OSN larvae are relevant to wild-type larvae."

These analyses relate OSN activity empirically determined to behavior using a model of sensory transduction and a GLM relating neural activity to the probability of turning. They also create closed loop virtual reality environments to test the effectiveness of their models. They conclude that OSN activity accurately predicts turning probability by a simple linear transform and thus OSN spiking dynamics in odor gradients are key for understanding chemotaxis."
