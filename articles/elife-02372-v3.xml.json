Individual myofibers and tenocytes in <i>Drosophila</i> interact through integrin (Itg) ligands such as Thrombospondin (Tsp), while vertebrate muscles attach to complex ECM fibrils embedded with tenocytes. We show for the first time that a vertebrate thrombospondin, Tsp4b, is essential for muscle attachment and ECM assembly at myotendinous junctions (MTJs). Tsp4b depletion in zebrafish causes muscle detachment upon contraction due to defects in laminin localization and reduced Itg signaling at MTJs. Mutation of its oligomerization domain renders Tsp4b unable to rescue these defects, demonstrating that pentamerization is required for ECM assembly. Furthermore, injected human TSP4 localizes to zebrafish MTJs and rescues muscle detachment and ECM assembly in Tsp4b-deficient embryos. Thus Tsp4 functions as an ECM scaffold at MTJs, with potential therapeutic uses in tendon strengthening and repair."

Furthermore, injected human TSP4 localizes to zebrafish MTJs and rescues muscle detachment and ECM assembly in Tsp4b-deficient embryos. Thus Tsp4 functions as an ECM scaffold at MTJs, with potential therapeutic uses in tendon strengthening and repair."

In zebrafish, two genes share sequence similarity with other vertebrate <i>Tsp4</i> genes\u2014<i>Tsp4a</i> and <i>Tsp4b</i> (previously designated as zgc: 111910, <i>tsp-4a</i> and <i>thbs4</i> on chromosome 21). Similar to other subclass B Tsps, Tsp4b is predicted to be secreted as a pentamer as it contains a conserved CX<sub>2</sub>C motif (CQAC\u2014Cys-Gln-Ala-Cys) identical to human TSP4 in its hydrophobic coiled-coil oligomerization domain (CCD) (25/36 residues are identical with human and mouse Tsp4), which is required for inter-subunit disulfide linkage (<a href=\"#bib30\">Efimov et al., 1994</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In situ analyses revealed <i>tsp4b</i> mRNA throughout the differentiating myotomes of embryonic somites beginning at 16 hr post fertilization (hpf, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Expression disappears in myoblasts as they differentiate and by 60 hpf becomes restricted to putative tendon cells near somite boundaries and along the horizontal myoseptum (arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) as well as at all muscle attachment sites of the head by 72 hpf (arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). The expression of <i>tsp4b</i> resembles that of <i>tenomodulin</i> (<i>tnmd</i>), a known tenocyte-specific marker (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and their relatives are co-expressed in tendons and ligaments in humans (<a href=\"#bib29\">Docheva et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Jelinsky et al., 2010</a>). Combined fluorescent localization of <i>tsp4b</i> mRNA and myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein revealed that down regulation of <i>tsp4b</i> in myotome occurs abruptly as the wave of muscle differentiation passes medio-laterally through each somite (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013H</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Devoto et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Henry et al., 2005</a>).

By 72 hpf, Tsp4b protein was detected at the ends of all larval axial, appendicular, pharyngeal and extraocular muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013L</a>). In the cranial region, these include muscle-cartilage attachments, inter-muscular attachments (between segments of the sternohyoideus [SH] muscle) and muscle-soft tissue attachments. These results suggest that during initial stages of muscle development in the trunk, myoblasts secrete their own Tsp4b to initiate attachment and MTJ assembly, and at later stages of somite muscle maturation, Tsp4b levels are maintained by secretion from tenocytes in mature MTJs."

                                "text": "Tsps function as Itg ligands. For example, interactions between vertebrate subclass A Tsps and Itgs are essential for wound healing (<a href=\"#bib55\">Kyriakides and Bornstein, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bornstein et al., 2004</a>). The RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif in <i>Drosophila</i> Tsp is required for its interactions with muscle-specific Itg to form stable attachments (<a href=\"#bib19\">Chanana et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Subramanian et al., 2007</a>). Zebrafish Tsp4b lacks an RGD but contains a non-canonical Itg-binding (KGD\u2014Lys-Gly-Asp) motif in its C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Ruoslahti, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adams, 2004</a>). We hypothesized that secreted Tsp4b in the ECM interacts with Itgs on muscle cell surfaces to promote attachment. To address this we examined effects of depleting Tsp4b on Itg activation and functional interactions with downstream Itg signaling components. Tsp4b-deficient animals showed severe reductions in key indicators of Itg signaling within myofibers. First, in 20\u201322 hpf embryos injected with <i>tsp4b</i>-MO, levels of activated focal adhesion kinase (FAK, detected with an antibody that recognizes phosphorylation at Tyrosine 861\u2014pFAK<sup>y861</sup>) were dramatically reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D,G</a>), which was rescued by injection of <i>tsp4b</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Henry et al., 2001</a>), and at later stages (36 hpf) were mislocalized or lost in local regions along somite boundaries (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H\u2013K</a>), which was also rescued by co-injection of <i>tsp4b</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L,M</a>). In regions where pFAK was mislocalized along the somite boundaries, muscle attachments appeared disorganized. Second, simultaneous partial reduction of Tsp4b (sub-threshold doses of <i>tsp4b</i>-MO) and Itg signaling in heterozygous <i>integrin-linked kinase</i> (<i>ilk</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup>) mutants, neither of which causes any detachment on its own, led to dramatic and widespread muscle detachment upon stimulation (<a href=\"#bib68\">Postel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4N</a>). Third, in Tsp4b-deficient embryos, expression and localization of a GFP-tagged Paxillin (Pxn)\u2014<i>Tg[Pxn-GFP]</i> - was significantly reduced, indicating a severe reduction in Itg signaling within the myofibers themselves (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). In addition, a <i>Tg[Itga5-RFP]</i> transgenic line showed specific localization of RFP at MTJs, while Itga6-GFP localized more broadly along the entire length of each muscle fiber, which is reduced in Tsp4b-deficient embryos (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). These results are consistent with a functional role for Tsp4b as a ligand for muscle-specific Itgs at MTJs required to stabilize muscle attachments and point to Itga5 as one likely receptor."

                                "text": "In addition to Tsp4, the myotendinous ECM (both early zebrafish myosepta and MTJs) contains Lams, Dystrophin (Dys), Tenascin, Fn, Cols and other Itg ligands. Lam and Dys deficiencies cause muscular dystrophies in humans and zebrafish. <i>lam</i> mutants show defects in myoseptum formation (<i>lama2</i>) and muscle patterning (<i>lamb1</i> and <i>lamc1</i> [<a href=\"#bib40\">Hall et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Peterson and Henry, 2010</a>]). Many of these ECM components interact with Itgs, and the defects in Itg activation that we have observed suggest that Tsp4b may regulate assembly of some of these other ECM components (<a href=\"#bib64\">Narouz-Ott et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Frolova et al., 2012</a>). To address this hypothesis we examined Lam localization (with a pan-Lam antibody) in Tsp4b-deficient embryos. We found that injection of <i>tsp4b</i>-MO caused a reduction in localization of Lam at somite boundaries at 24 hpf (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D,G,N</a>), which was rescued by co-injection of <i>tsp4b mRNA</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013G</a>). This correlated with disorganized muscle attachments. At later stages (36 hpf), Tsp4b-deficient embryos showed discontinuities in Lam distribution at somite boundaries (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H\u2013K,N</a>), with many fibers forming aberrant attachments at sites of localized Lam, which could be rescued by co-injection of <i>tsp4b</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L,M</a>). <i>lam</i> mRNA (<i>lama2, lamb1, lamc1, lamc2</i>) levels were not significantly affected by <i>tsp4b</i> depletion suggesting that these effects are post-transcriptional (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and most likely due to Tsp4b-Lam interactions. In vitro binding assays using purified rat TSP4 have shown interactions with Lam, Col, and Fn among other ECM components (<a href=\"#bib64\">Narouz-Ott et al., 2000</a>). Thus, Tsp4b could interact with Lam in a similar heteromeric complex, and initiate an Itg signaling cascade necessary for maintenance of MTJs."

To test requirements for oligomerization of Tsp4b in its localization we perturbed Tsp4b function by preventing it from forming the functional homo-pentameric form. To do this, we mutated the conserved CCD of Tsp4b, CQAC (<a href=\"#bib30\">Efimov et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">McKenzie et al., 2006</a>) to SQAS (Ser-Gln-Ala-Ser) to prevent formation of inter-subunit disulfide bridges that are required for pentamerization. To verify <i>SQAS-gfp</i> mRNA expression, we injected wild type <i>tsp4b-gfp</i> and <i>SQAS-gfp</i> into one-cell stage embryos and analyzed them for expression at gastrula stages. Both <i>SQAS-gfp</i> and <i>tsp4b-gfp</i> were expressed similarly and strongly fluorescent at 7\u20138 hpf, suggesting that the mutated SQAS protein is synthesized and secreted (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, at later stages while <i>tsp4b-gfp</i> localized to MTJs similar to wild-type Tsp4b, SQAS-gfp fluorescence was not localized and gradually disappeared (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>).

To confirm the role of CQAC motif in maintaining stable functional Tsp4b pentamers, we extracted whole embryo protein under non-reducing conditions, from 36 hpf Tsp4b-deficient embryos expressing Tsp4b-GFP, SQAS-GFP and co-expressing SQAS-GFP and Tsp4b-FLAG respectively. A western blot of the protein extract showed that Tsp4b-FLAG and Tsp-GFP predominantly existed as a pentamers, while SQAS-GFP was exclusively present as monomers, further confirming that the oligomerization function of Tsp4b mediated by CQAC motif of CCD is essential for localization of Tsp4b to the MTJ (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

Zebrafish Tsp4b shares the conserved C-terminal domain with human TSP4 and TSP5. The C-terminal region of mammalian Tsp5, which also functions as a pentamer, has been suggested to interact with multiple ECM proteins in cartilage (<a href=\"#bib44\">Hecht et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Chen et al., 2007</a>) and with collagen fibrils in tendons (<a href=\"#bib22\">Chen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">S\u00f6dersten et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Tan and Lawler, 2009</a>).

Axial muscles attach directly to the basement membrane at somite boundaries in the early embryo and become contractile and functional at least 12 hr before tenocytes are detected at MTJs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Devoto et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Barresi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Henry et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Snow and Henry, 2009</a>). Our results suggest that after axial muscle progenitors attach, they secrete their own Tsp4b, which they downregulate upon differentiation, while later Tsp4b is secreted and maintained by tenocytes. Tenocytes in the zebrafish trunk likely originate from the syndetome compartment in each somite, similar to their counterparts in the chick, and migrate to sites of muscle attachment (<a href=\"#bib14\">Brent et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Shukunami et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Chen and Galloway, 2014</a>). In contrast, we observe Tsp4b expression in cranial tenocytes at MTJs but not in cranial muscles. This difference in the timing and sources of Tsp4b between cranial and axial muscles suggests that there are distinct types of interactions between myoblasts and tenocytes involved in forming different types of MTJs. Our results suggest that Tsp4b is required for both initial attachments of some early muscles, which correlates with defects in early ECM, as well as more broadly in the maintenance of all types of attachments."

Similarly, Tsp4b-deficient zebrafish appear largely unaffected until their muscles are subjected to multiple contractions. Stress-induced expression appears to be a common feature of many Tsps. For example, TSP4 (and other Tsps) is upregulated in response to exercise, myocardial infarction and in several types of muscular dystrophy (<a href=\"#bib24\">Chen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Timmons et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Frolova et al., 2012</a>). Tsp5 expression is elevated in response to biomechanical stress (<a href=\"#bib44\">Hecht et al., 1998</a>). Subclass A Tsps (Tsp 1\u20132) are also elevated in response to injury or inflammation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bornstein et al., 2004</a>). Elevated Tsp expression in all these scenarios could reflect an attempt by cells at ECM repair but may also be detrimental by causing tissue fibrosis. Consistent with this idea, in <i>Tsp2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutant mice, wound healing progresses rapidly without scarring, but with abnormal Col fibril structure (<a href=\"#bib57\">Kyriakides et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bornstein et al., 2004</a>). <i>Tsp4</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice show elevated levels of Col (Col I, II, III, V) in the heart. This elevated accumulation of Col is reversed with application of TSP4 in an in vitro cell culture system (<a href=\"#bib35\">Frolova et al., 2012</a>). This result is similar to our in vivo study, where injected TSP4 rescues the Tsp4b-deficient phenotype, suggesting that the scaffolding function of Tsp4 is evolutionarily conserved and functions as a modulator of ECM organization in multiple tissue types. Recent work on the functions of Tsp4 in cardiac ECM has shown interesting intracellular functions, where Tsp4 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of cardiac fibroblasts promotes nuclear shuttling of activating transcription factor 6 alpha (<a href=\"#bib60\">Lynch et al., 2012</a>). While this intracellular role of Tsp4 cannot be ruled out in MTJ organization, the ability of exogenous TSP4 protein injected extracellularly to rescue a Tsp4b-deficient phenotype suggests that the primary function of Tsp4 is in ECM organization at MTJs."

Using the line draw function, lines were drawn spanning the edges of the basement membranes at the three widest regions in the image. The number of pixels spanning the length of these lines were recorded and averaged for each image. The width of the basement membrane was calculated by: (total pixels along an average width of an MTJ \u2212 0.5 micron)/(total pixels along the length of the scale bar). In most of the stimulated Tsp4b-deficient embryos, the MTJ gaps were very wide and not captured in a single image and hence not quantified."

As in Drosophila, Thrombospondin is required for stable muscle attachments in vertebrates. Human <i>tsp4b</i> RNA rescues zebrafish <i>tsp4b</i> morphants suggesting conservation of function. Elegant mosaic analysis shows regional rescue of muscle around Tsp4b-expressing cells. Also demonstrated clearly are effects through Tsbp4 on other integrin mediated events both inside and the cell (FAK phosphorylation and paxillin localisation) and outside the cell, laminin organisation. The manuscript has the potential to be stunning and impactful, adding to our understanding of muscle and tendon development and function in the zebrafish model, and has relevance and implications for the study of human muscle/tendon disease and injury."

Tsp4b interacts with all these ECM components in the MTJ and as a scaffold enables organization of these ECM components enabling muscle attachment at both early and later stages of somite development. The slow muscle fibers, which develop first, initially attach through predominantly integrin dependent interactions with Fn and later as Fn levels decrease, integrin-laminin and integrin-collagen interactions play an important role in attachment. At later stages, dystrophin-dystroglycan adhesion complexes also interact with matrix components of the MTJ (<a href=\"#bib47\">Jacoby et al., 2009</a>). Hence, the nature of muscle attachment at the MTJ varies depending on the development stage of muscle fibers and the predominant matrix component involved in the attachment. Tsp4b, as a scaffolding protein and integrin ligand is expressed from early somitogenesis through adult life and modulates the organization of the ECM at the MTJ during every stage of development from somitogenesis."
