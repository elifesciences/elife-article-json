Mammalian cell function is dynamically regulated by the interaction of cell surface galectins with branched N-glycans. Here we report that N-glycan branching deficiency triggers the Golgi to generate bioequivalent N-glycans that preserve galectin-glycoprotein interactions and cellular homeostasis. Galectins bind N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) units within N-glycans initiated from UDP-GlcNAc by the <i>medial</i>-Golgi branching enzymes as well as the <i>trans</i>-Golgi poly-LacNAc extension enzyme \u03b21,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (B3GNT). Marginally reducing LacNAc content by limiting N-glycans to three branches results in T-cell hyperactivity and autoimmunity; yet further restricting branching does not produce a more hyperactive state. Rather, new poly-LacNAc extension by B3GNT maintains galectin binding and immune homeostasis. Poly-LacNAc extension is triggered by redistribution of unused UDP-GlcNAc from the <i>medial</i> to <i>trans</i>-Golgi via inter-cisternal tubules. These data demonstrate the functional equivalency of structurally dissimilar N-glycans and suggest a self-correcting feature of the Golgi that sustains cellular homeostasis."

Mammalian cell function is dynamically regulated by the interaction of cell surface galectins with branched N-glycans. Here we report that N-glycan branching deficiency triggers the Golgi to generate bioequivalent N-glycans that preserve galectin-glycoprotein interactions and cellular homeostasis. Galectins bind N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) units within N-glycans initiated from UDP-GlcNAc by the <i>medial</i>-Golgi branching enzymes as well as the <i>trans</i>-Golgi poly-LacNAc extension enzyme \u03b21,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (B3GNT). Marginally reducing LacNAc content by limiting N-glycans to three branches results in T-cell hyperactivity and autoimmunity; yet further restricting branching does not produce a more hyperactive state. Rather, new poly-LacNAc extension by B3GNT maintains galectin binding and immune homeostasis. Poly-LacNAc extension is triggered by redistribution of unused UDP-GlcNAc from the <i>medial</i> to <i>trans</i>-Golgi via inter-cisternal tubules. These data demonstrate the functional equivalency of structurally dissimilar N-glycans and suggest a self-correcting feature of the Golgi that sustains cellular homeostasis."

These chains turned out to be biologically equivalent to branched LacNAc glycans, containing the same sugar subunits and allowing the immune cells to behave as normal. This suggests that the composition of glycans, rather than their structure, primarily determines their role."

The vast majority of secreted and cell surface proteins are co- or post-translationally modified by the addition of sugars in the ER. As these proteins transit through the ER and Golgi, their glycans undergo dramatic remodeling, generating a vast and heterogeneous array of glycoforms (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Schachter, 1991</a>). In the <i>medial</i> Golgi a group of enzymes, MGAT1, 2, 4, and 5, act to produce N-glycans with one, two, three, or four N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) branches (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schachter, 1986</a>). The subsequent addition of galactose by a family of galactosyl transferase enzymes produces the galectin substrate LacNAc (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The number of branches depends on the relative activity of the <i>medial</i> Golgi branching enzymes MGAT1, 2, 4, and 5 and the availability of their shared donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dennis et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Grigorian et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">2011</a>). Alternating action of \u03b21,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (B3GNT) and galactosyl transferase enzymes can generate a linear polymer of LacNAc (poly-LacNAc) at any given branch. Although the affinity of galectin binding to a LacNAc monomer is relatively weak, increased LacNAc valency through branching and poly-LacNAc extension can dramatically increase galectin avidity leading to a major impact on cell surface dynamics (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hirabayashi et al., 2002</a>). In T cells for example, galectin - T cell receptor (TCR) interactions directly oppose ligand induced TCR clustering and signaling, thereby negatively regulating T cell development, antigen-dependent T cell growth, and autoimmunity risk."

The function of these changes is unclear, but some have suggested that the observed structural alterations may reflect production of bioequivalent glycans that are induced by communication between the cell surface and the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib49\">Takamatsu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dam and Brewer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dennis and Brewer, 2013</a>). However, direct evidence supporting this possibility is lacking. Deficiency in the branching enzyme \u03b21,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (MGAT5) reduces avidity for galectin, enhancing antigen dependent and independent TCR clustering/signaling, leading to development of spontaneous autoimmune disease (<a href=\"#bib12\">Demetriou et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2007</a>). Based on the current model of the galectin-glycoprotein lattice, more severe reductions in branching should weaken the lattice further and result in greater T cell hyperactivity. Surprisingly, further limiting branching revealed that the Golgi apparatus has a remarkable capacity to buffer challenges to the strength of the galectin-glycoprotein lattice. Our analysis reveals a homeostatic mechanism built into the architecture of the Golgi apparatus that induces bioequivalent poly-LacNAc glycans that act to maintain the function of the galectin-glycoprotein lattice in the face of dysregulated Golgi branching."

Examination of peripheral T cells from <i>Mgat2</i><sup>f/f</sup>::<i>Lck-Cre</i><sup>+</sup> mice indicated loss of <i>Mgat2</i> in most but not all T cells as assayed by flow cytometry with the plant lectin L-PHA (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris,</i> leukoagglutinin) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). \u03b21,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans produced by MGAT5 specifically bind L-PHA, structures that are also lost following <i>Mgat2</i> deletion (<a href=\"#bib12\">Demetriou et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cummings and Kornfeld, 1982</a>). Surprisingly, <i>Mgat5</i> and <i>Mgat2</i> deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells displayed a similar degree of activation and proliferation in response to anti-CD3 (an antibody which induces TCR clustering and signaling) despite the more dramatic reduction in LacNAc branching in <i>Mgat2</i> deficient T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B,D and E</a>). This suggested that either the \u03b21,6GlcNAc branch produced by the MGAT5 enzyme is uniquely important for regulating T cell activation or that a compensatory mechanism maintains galectin binding when the number of LacNAc branches is reduced. To evaluate for potential differences in total surface LacNAc content between <i>Mgat2</i> and <i>Mgat5</i> deficient T cells, galectin-3 binding at the cell surface was measured by flow cytometry. <i>Mgat5</i> deletion resulted in a significant reduction in the ability of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to bind galectin-3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and F</a>), consistent with previously published results (<a href=\"#bib12\">Demetriou et al., 2001</a>). However, <i>Mgat2</i> deficiency produced no additional decrease in galectin-3 binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and F</a>), suggesting comparable LacNAc content at the cell surface despite a marked reduction in LacNAc branches in <i>Mgat2</i> relative to <i>Mgat5</i> deficient T cells."

To test this prediction, T cells and thymocytes were stained with L-PHA as well as the <i>Lycopersicon Esculentum</i> lectin (LEA). LEA binds to poly-LacNAc structures containing at least three repeating LacNAc units (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kawashima et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Merkle and Cummings, 1987</a>). Wild type and <i>Mgat5</i><sup>-/-</sup> T cells and thymocytes expressed very low levels of poly-LacNAc. However, in <i>Mgat2</i><sup>f/f</sup>::<i>Lck-Cre</i><sup>+</sup> mice, loss of L-PHA staining was accompanied by a ~100 fold increase in LEA staining. The loss of L-PHA binding and the increase in LEA binding appeared to occur concurrently during the double positive stage of thymocyte development, shortly after the Lck promoter driven Cre is first expressed, and were maintained through the single positive stage and in peripheral T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Treatment of various cell types with swainsonine (SW), a mannosidase II inhibitor which blocks N-glycan processing between MGAT1 and MGAT2 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicated that homeostatic up-regulation of poly-LacNAc was a general feature of many cell types including epithelial, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic cells; with the greatest responses in the latter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>)."

Furthermore, LEA has been reported to bind to high-mannose structures in addition to poly-LacNAc (<a href=\"#bib42\">Oguri, 2005</a>). To investigate the structural basis for the increase in LEA staining, <i>Mgat2</i> deficient T cells were treated with PNGase F, an amidase which specifically cleaves N \u2013glycans (<a href=\"#bib36\">Maley et al., 1989</a>). PNGase F treatment of live cells incompletely removes N-glycans, with a four hour treatment of <i>Mgat2</i><sup>f/f</sup> T cells reducing cell surface L-PHA binding by ~50% (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). Nevertheless, the same treatment resulted in a &gt;80% reduction in LEA binding in <i>Mgat2</i> deficient T cells, suggesting that the vast majority of LEA staining was due to cell surface N-glycans (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). To further evaluate this question, we directly compared thymocytes derived from <i>Mgat2</i><sup>f/f</sup>::<i>Lck-Cre</i><sup>+</sup> and <i>Mgat1</i><sup>f/f</sup>::<i>Lck-Cre</i><sup>+</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhou, 2014</a>). <i>Mgat1</i> deficiency blocks all branching and poly-LacNAc extension in N-glycans, but not O-glycans or glycolipids. Indeed, unlike <i>Mgat2</i> deficiency, <i>Mgat1</i> deficient thymocytes do not show an increase in LEA staining concurrent with the loss in L-PHA staining (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Similarly, SW increases LEA staining in CHO cells but not <i>Mgat1</i> deficient CHO (Lec1) cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). Furthermore, increased LEA staining induced by SW treatment of T cells was reversed by the mannosidase I inhibitors deoxymannojirimycin (DMN) and kifunensine (kif), which block the N-glycan pathway prior to MGAT1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

SW treated Jurkat cells, rather than T cells from <i>Mgat2</i><sup>f/f</sup>::<i>Lck-Cre</i><sup>+</sup> mice, were used for this purpose to provide a sufficient amount of starting material for accurate analysis. MALDI-TOF-MS of N-glycans derived from SW treated Jurkat T cells confirmed the presence of hybrid N-glycans with up to two poly-LacNAc extended branches (m/z 2897, 3102, 3347, 3551, and 4000 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This was qualitatively consistent with the presence of poly-LacNAc following SW treatment, but likely under-represents the length of poly-LacNAc extension due to the limited sensitivity of MALDI-TOF-MS for large poly-LacNAc structures. To better quantitate the change in poly-LacNAc, endo-\u03b2-galactosidase digestion was used. This enzyme cuts all internal Gal\u03b21,4 linkages in poly-LacNAc structures, unless the GlcNAc on its reducing side is modified by fucose. Endo-\u03b2-galactosidase digestion produced GlcNAc\u03b21,3Gal (m/z 518) from internal linear poly-LacNAc antennae, together with Gal\u03b21,4GlcNAc\u03b21,3Gal (m/z 722) and NeuAc-Gal\u03b21,4GlcNAc\u03b21,3Gal (m/z 1084) from their non-reducing termini (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The ratio of the internal and terminal glycans examines the relative length of linear poly-LacNAc structures, with a higher ratio signifying longer chains. The non-treated cells had a ratio of 0.5, which increased to 1.1 in the SW treated cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F and G</a>), confirming the presence of longer poly-LacNAc chains after SW treatment. <i>Mgat2\u00a0</i>deficient T cells are expected to have a greater increase, given the ~100 fold increase in LEA binding compared to the ~20 fold increase in SW treated Jurkat cells. Together, these data indicate that severe LacNAc branching deficiency increases poly-LacNAc structures on N-glycans."

With this prediction in mind, Jurkat T cells were treated with SW for various times and analyzed for changes in cell surface glycosylation by L-PHA, LEA, and Concanavalin A (ConA), the latter a plant lectin that binds high-mannose structures increased by SW treatment (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>).

Measurement of total cellular UDP-GlcNAc levels by mass spectrometry and/or a colorimetric assay in cell lysates of purified <i>Mgat2</i><sup>+/+</sup> versus <i>Mgat2</i><sup>-/-</sup> T cells as well as Jurkat T cells treated with or without SW and kifunensine revealed no increase from branching deficiency (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a>). Supplementing cells with GlcNAc raises cellular UDP-GlcNAc and branching (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mkhikian et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Grigorian et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Grigorian et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, treatment of Jurkat T cells with GlcNAc did not increase LEA staining despite a 3\u20134 fold increase in cellular UDP-GlcNAc concentrations; although it further enhanced SW induced poly-LacNAc extension (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Over-expression of the three UDP-GlcNAc Golgi transporters (SLC35A3, SLC35B4, and SLC35D2) via transfection into Jurkat T cells also did not increase LEA staining (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Thus, much like TCR signaling, increased cellular UDP-GlcNAc levels are neither necessary nor sufficient to induce homeostatic up-regulation of poly-LacNAc. Not surprisingly, poly-LacNAc induction was blocked by 4-Fluoro-GlcNAc, a drug known to inhibit poly-LacNAc production by reducing UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barthel et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013G</a>)."

                                "text": "Glycosylation enzymes are organized in order of action from <i>cis</i> to <i>trans</i> along the secretory pathway. The branching enzymes (i.e. MGAT1, 2, 4 and 5) are localized to the <i>medial</i> Golgi, while the galactosyl transferase and B3GNT enzymes reside in the <i>trans</i> Golgi. The CMP-sialic acid transporter has a relatively restricted localization within the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zhao et al., 2006</a>), suggesting that sugar-nucleotide donors may be preferentially supplied to specific Golgi compartments. We hypothesized that UDP-GlcNAc supply and associated transporters may be restricted to the <i>cis/medial</i> Golgi compartment, thus preferentially driving branching over extension. Consistent with this hypothesis, raising total cellular UDP-GlcNAc increases branching by the <i>medial</i> Golgi enzymes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mkhikian et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Grigorian et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Grigorian et al., 2011</a>), but does not induce significant up-regulation of poly-LacNAc extension by <i>trans</i> Golgi B3GNT enzymes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). This suggests that cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc lacks direct access to the <i>trans</i> Golgi compartment. To further evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the subcellular localization of the three UDP-GlcNAc Golgi transporters (SLC35A3, SLC35B4, and SLC35D2) and B3GNT2. Jurkat T cells were transfected with DDK or HA tagged versions of these proteins and examined for intra-Golgi localization using confocal microscopy-based line scan analysis. Intra-Golgi localization was determined by co-staining transfected cells with the <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> markers GM130 and TGN46, respectively, and determining the peak intensity of fluorescence along a line scan relative to these markers (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dejgaard et al., 2007</a>). All three UDP-GlcNAc transporters localized to the <i>cis</i> and <i>medial</i> Golgi compartments while B3GNT2 localized to a later Golgi compartment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013E</a>). In addition, overexpression of the UDP-GlcNAc transporters did not drive poly-LacNAc production (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). These results suggest that the <i>trans</i> Golgi is comparatively deficient in UDP-GlcNAc, thereby limiting B3GNT activity and poly-LacNAc extension under steady state conditions."

                                "text": "As B3GNT requires UDP-GlcNAc to generate poly-LacNAc, we reasoned that these two factors must co-localize to drive homeostatic up-regulation of poly-LacNAc following disruption of branching activity. Co-localization may arise from movement of UDP-GlcNAc transporters to the <i>trans</i> Golgi and/or movement of B3GNT to the <i>medial</i> Golgi. However, SW treatment did not alter the Golgi localization of the three UDP-GlcNAc transporters or B3GNT2, arguing against this possibility (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Alternatively, UDP-GlcNAc may directly shift from the <i>medial</i> to <i>trans</i> Golgi via the inter-cisternal transport system. Significant loss of activity of <i>medial</i> Golgi branching enzymes should acutely raise UDP-GlcNAc levels within the <i>medial</i> Golgi, with excess UDP-GlcNAc subsequently moving forward to the <i>trans</i> Golgi via inter-cisternal diffusion. Measuring UDP-GlcNAc by LC-MS/MS in a whole cell vesicular fraction isolated from post nuclear supernatant revealed significant levels of UDP-GlcNAc (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). To ensure that UDP-GlcNAc was indeed within the vesicles as opposed to merely associated with the outer membrane, the post nuclear supernatant (PNS) was treated with either 0.1% Triton-X or 50\u00a0mM uridine monophosphate (UMP) for 15 min prior to isolation of the vesicular fraction by ultra-centrifugation. Both treatments significantly reduced the amount of UDP-GlcNAc in the vesicular fraction, confirming UDP-GlcNAc was located in vesicles containing UDP-GlcNAc/UMP anti-porters (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>)."

Consistent with our hypothesis, UDP-GlcNAc levels were elevated in the vesicular but not the cytosolic fractions of kifunensine treated Jurkat T cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To examine the Golgi directly, we used antibodies to the <i>trans</i> marker TGN46 to immuno-isolate a Golgi enriched fraction from Jurkat T cell PNS. As expected from the physical connections between Golgi cisterna, western blotting for <i>cis, medial,</i> and <i>trans</i> Golgi markers confirmed that all three cisternal compartments were recovered with anti-TGN46 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). UDP-GlcNAc was elevated in the Golgi of kifunensine treated Jurkat T cells despite no difference in total cellular or cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4G</a>,<a href=\"#fig6\">6A,C</a>). Finally, we isolated a fraction enriched for <i>trans</i>-Golgi network (TGN) vesicles from Jurkat T cells by pretreating with Brefeldin A prior to pull down with anti-TGN46.

However, this model has recently been expanded by data suggesting that small cargo transits the Golgi by diffusion via inter-cisternal tubules that vertically connect the <i>cis, medial,</i> and <i>trans</i> compartments (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mart\u00ednez-Alonso et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Beznoussenko et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>). Indeed, at least in CHO cells, there is evidence for functional continuity throughout sub-compartments of the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2001</a>). Golgi stacks, consisting of the <i>cis, medial,</i> and <i>trans</i> compartments, are also connected longitudinally to other Golgi stacks by tubules. Nocodazole, which interrupts longitudinal but not vertical Golgi tubules, had no effect on poly-LacNAc induction by SW in Jurkat T cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). In contrast, pyrrophenone disrupts both longitudinal and inter-cisternal vertical tubules via inhibition of cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>-\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib45\">San Pietro et al., 2009</a>). Pyrrophenone significantly blocked SW induced up-regulation of poly-LacNAc in Jurkat T cells in a dose dependent manner, as indicated by comparing its effects on LEA and ConA staining; the latter controlling for any changes in Golgi transport (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In contrast, pyrrophenone had no effect on ConA, LEA, or L-PHA levels in control Jurkat T cells lacking SW (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014supplement figure 1F\u2013H</a>). We conclude that when branching enzymes under-utilize UDP-GlcNAc in the <i>medial</i> Golgi, UDP-GlcNAc accumulates and then shifts by diffusion to the <i>trans</i> Golgi via inter-cisternal tubules, thereby increasing substrate supply to B3GNT and triggering poly-LacNAc extension (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). However, our data do not exclude additional transfer of UDP-GlcNAc via vesicles or by cisternal maturation."

The resulting array of N-glycans produced thus contains more LacNAc branches than linear LacNAc polymers (<b>A</b>). When the branching pathway is disrupted (<b>B</b>), or presumably the Golgi is otherwise stressed, leading to reduced UDP-GlcNAc usage in the <i>medial</i> Golgi, UDP-GlcNAc is driven forward (at least partially through intercisternal tubules) and promotes production of bioequivalent poly-LacNAc containing glycans by the <i>trans</i> Golgi-resident B3GNT family of enzymes. Under this scenario, loss of LacNAc branches is balanced by increased production of linear LacNAc polymers, a self-correcting ability that serves to maintain cell surface LacNAc density and thus the galectin-glycoprotein lattice (<b>A</b>).

The complexity of glycan structures provides tremendous challenges for discerning the functional role of glycans in biology. Although N-glycan structures are highly diverse, redundancy of structural motifs within individual glycans has previously received little consideration as a means to collapse complexity and decipher glycan information. Deficiency of glycosylation pathway genes often give rise to new and unusual structures, triggering some to suggest that these may represent compensatory structures (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stone et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Takamatsu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ismail et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dam and Brewer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dennis and Brewer, 2013</a>). However, proof of functional equivalency has largely been lacking. The similar degree of hyperactivity between <i>Mgat5</i> and <i>Mgat2</i> deficient T cells indicates that poly-LacNAc extended hybrid structures are functionally equivalent to complex tri-antennary structures. Importantly, blockade of mannosidase II and <i>Mgat2</i> deficiency produced a similar phenotype, which was blocked/reversed by both mannosidase I inhibition and <i>Mgat1</i> deficiency, despite each targeting distinct biochemical steps and resulting in distinct structures. Thus, our data demonstrate that structurally diverse glycans are biologically equivalent if they share a similar amount of LacNAc. The overall glycan structure sets the total LacNAc content, thereby largely determining avidity of binding for galectins. It should be noted however, that although these differing glycoforms are clearly overlapping, they might not be strictly identical due to distinct geometries of LacNAc presentation or modification by fucose or sialic acid."

Our data suggests that glycan diversity may be collapsed into a much smaller group of bioequivalent structures based on the number of structural subunits within the overall glycan that bind to a given animal lectin. Indeed, it may be possible that through further studies exploring bioequivalence among glycans, a glycan code can be deciphered based on interaction with animal lectins. Such an approach may greatly alleviate the complexity in determining structure-function relationships and relevance to human health."

N-glycosylation is an essential biosynthetic pathway necessary for cellular homeostasis and mammalian development (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dennis et al., 2009</a>), yet lacks a known self-correcting mechanism. Our data suggest that homeostatic control of LacNAc content does not result from changes in enzyme levels/activity or metabolic production of UDP-GlcNAc substrate; but rather appears to arise from the structure of the Golgi. A defining feature of the Golgi is its polarized compartmentalization, with a <i>cis</i> to <i>trans</i> organization. Glycosylation enzymes are arranged along the Golgi roughly in the order in which they act. Why the Golgi has evolved this organization remains an open question. Our data indicate that the UDP-GlcNAc transporters preferentially supply UDP-GlcNAc to the <i>cis/medial</i> over <i>trans</i> Golgi, thus prioritizing branching over extension. Despite the presence of continuities between Golgi cisterna and previous work arguing that the Golgi is functionally interconnected (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2001</a>), our data suggest that the segmented organization of enzymes and transporters allows for local depletion of substrate prior to diffusion to other compartments. In this manner, the evolutionary placement of the B3GNT poly-LacNAc extension enzymes in the <i>trans</i> Golgi provides a backup mechanism that captures unused UDP-GlcNAc from the <i>medial</i> Golgi shunted via inter-cisternal tubules. This backup system may also explain the lack of evolutionary pressure to produce genetic redundancy in the Golgi branching enzymes in mammals and the dramatically more severe phenotype seen with <i>Mgat1</i> deficiency, which blocks all production of N-glycan LacNAc, compared to other <i>Mgat</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ioffe and Stanley, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Metzler et al., 1994</a>)."

Thus, fidelity of glycan biosynthesis must be maintained under a variety of cellular states and be active virtually at all times. High protein transit rates present a significant challenge to the Golgi and have the potential to reduce the <i>medial</i> Golgi branching efficiency by decreasing the time available for branching reactions. Under this scenario, having a back-up system that provides poly-LacNAc extension in the <i>trans</i> Golgi by capturing unused UDP-GlcNAc from the <i>medial</i> Golgi would be critical for the maintenance of the lattice at a minimal essential level. Even in an unstressed system, a second step in the assembly line would act to counteract the moment to moment variability and stochastic uncertainty of glycan synthesis. Severe branching deficiency (induced by SW treatment or <i>Mgat2</i> deletion) uncovers this continual process. Such a mechanism is akin to DNA repair, which is occurring all of the time but made more apparent in the context of physiological or external stress."

Thus, therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting the lattice should block branching and extension simultaneously, or target a more proximal regulator such as UDP-GlcNAc metabolism or transport. In light of these considerations, the lattice approach to cancer treatment may merit re-visitation. Conversely, a deeper knowledge of the central regulatory machinery that determines total LacNAc content will also be required for therapeutic approaches that seek to strengthen the lattice."

Line-scans (8\u201310 pixels wide) were drawn perpendicular to the long axis on areas of the Golgi showing maximal separation of GM130 and TGN46. Line-scans were used if they resulted in a single clearly discernable peak in all three channels. The relative distance of the peak intensity of the protein of interest compared to the peak intensities of GM130 and TGN46 was then used to determine intra-Golgi localization."

This lab and others have shown that the presence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine on the N-glycan branch created by an N-acetyl-Glucosaminyltransferse (GNT-V, encoded by MgatV) is essential for creation of lattices (or aggregate) composed of protein-bound glycans and multivalent lectins called galectins. This was a novel perspective when it was introduced 15 years ago. Evidence favoring it has grown in time and its functionality has been documented in deletion of GNT-V (MgatV) that leads to the loss of poly-N-acetyllactosamine on that branch, loss of galectin binding and dramatic decrease in tumor metastasis and increase in autoimmunity. Normally the lattice appears to prevent the inappropriate activation of the T-cell receptor. With the lattice gone, the TCR is able to recruit other cell surface molecules to mount T-cell response."

Presumably, this would further reduce lectin binding and lattice formation and lead to more severe functional response. This did not occur. Instead they found a compensatory functional response in which the poly-N-acetyllactosamine repeats are added to another branch that normally would not contain them. To explain this, they propose a mechanism based on donor substrate localization to account for the compensation and float the hypothesis that generating bioequivalent structures may be a common way to maintain homeostasis in response to imbalances or insults. This is a novel perspective."

Results presented here suggest that the Golgi has a built-in self-correction mechanism in which a deficiency in synthesis of LacNAc branches by cis/medial-Golgi Mgat enzymes is compensated for by enhanced synthesis of linear poly-LacNAc chains by the \u03b2-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (B3GnT) enzyme in the trans-Golgi.

We have re-worked the paper to better emphasize bio-equivalence. For example, we have removed the term \u201cproof-reading\u201d from the title and text, and describe this now as self-correction. We have also re-organized the paper to focus on bio-equivalence.

At the cell surface, mono- and bi-antennary glycans greatly outnumber tri- and tetra-antennary glycans, particularly in low branching cell types such as T cells. This is also apparent when we consider the relative affinity of the MGAT enzymes for UDP-GlcNAc. MGAT1 has the best affinity with Km ~0.04mM. The affinities decrease sequentially for MGAT2 (~0.9mM), MGAT4 (~4mM) and MGAT5 (~11mM). In other words, relative UDP-GlcNAc usage markedly decreases from MGAT1 to MGAT5. Therefore, according to our model, inhibition or loss of MGAT5 is expected to result in very little increase in UDP-GlcNAc availability to B3GNT2, as enzymes with much greater activity (i.e. MGAT1 and 2) will utilize the excess supply. In comparison, MGAT2 loss or inhibition would be expected to result in a much larger rise in UDP-GlcNAc levels in the trans Golgi.

In contrast, the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein, being template driven is guided by very specific instructions. To use the names of the processes literally, it is as if the assignment is to copy or transcribe or translate (word for word) an assigned text. Predicting the outcome is straightforward given the quality of the template and the competence of \u201cthe staff\u201d. Glycan synthesis by comparison is akin to asking many more players to produce a finger painting under a specific rule set (you can only use certain fingers (monosaccarides) in specific orders and patterns). The \u201cinstruction\u201d is specified by the enzymatic and chemical restrictions, but the resulting product cannot be predicted with anything near the exactness of template driven processes. In addition, the integrity of the genome is maintained in part by restricting DNA replication to a highly controlled context and defined period of time. Glycan biosynthesis by contrast must function in a variety of cellular states and be active virtually at all times. Nevertheless, the Golgi system is charged with maintaining the integrity of the glycome/lattice or risk disease. Just as you point out, the most obvious/likely situations in which such an assembly-line corrective mechanism might function is in response to changes in protein synthesis, metabolism, and cargo transit rates. It is a reasonable hypothesis that high protein transit rates through the medial Golgi would reduce branching efficiency by decreasing the time available for branching reactions. Under this scenario, having a back-up system that provides poly-LacNAc extension in the trans Golgi by capturing unused UDP-GlcNAc from the medial Golgi would be critical for the maintenance of the lattice at a minimal essential level. Even in an unstressed system, a second step in the assembly line would act to counteract the moment to moment variability and stochastic uncertainty of glycan synthesis. We believe that severe branching deficiency (induced by SW treatment or <i>Mgat2</i> deletion) uncovers this continual process which is difficult to appreciate at baseline due to technical limitations. This would be akin to DNA repair mechanisms, which are occurring all of the time but made more apparent in the context of super-physiological stress."

For that reason we performed the endo-\u03b2-galactosidase digestion analysis, which revealed increased poly-LacNAc in the Jurkat sample."

The overall glycan structure sets the total LacNAc content, thereby largely determining avidity of binding without affecting affinity of binding (assuming other modifications that may impact binding such as fucose and sialic acid are held constant). Thus, we are not arguing that there is a change in bio-specificity of galectin-glycan interactions, just a recognition that the number of binding sites in the overall glycan (i.e. LacNAc content) is a major driver of bio-equivalence in a manner that does not affect bio-specificity."

Coupled with our data indicating that UDP-GlcNAc transporters are absent from the trans Golgi, we interpret this to mean that excess UDP-GlcNAc generated by GlcNAc addition is indeed consumed by the medial Golgi branching enzymes. In the presence of SW, GlcNAc treatment does substantially increase LEA binding, implying that UDP-GlcNAc is limiting for poly-LacNAc production but only becomes available to B3GNT when the branching enzymes are inhibited. It should be noted that an increase in total cellular UDP-GlcNAc may not necessarily result in one for one increase in Golgi UDP-GlcNAc. The apparent Km of the transporters is measured at 1-10 uM, which is lower than the cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc concentration. Therefore it is likely that increased cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc levels are not fully translated to the Golgi levels."
