Diffusion tensor imaging was applied in healthy participants alongside an odd-one-out paradigm sensitive to PrC and HC lesions in animals and humans. Microstructure of inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF, connecting occipital and ventro-anterior temporal lobe, including PrC) and fornix (the main HC input/output pathway) correlated with accuracy on odd-one-out judgements involving faces and scenes, respectively. Similarly, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in PrC and HC, elicited during oddity judgements, was correlated with face and scene oddity performance, respectively. We also observed associations between ILF and fornix microstructure and category-selective BOLD response in PrC and HC, respectively. These striking three-way associations highlight functionally dissociable, structurally instantiated MTL neurocognitive networks for complex face and scene perception."

Diffusion tensor imaging was applied in healthy participants alongside an odd-one-out paradigm sensitive to PrC and HC lesions in animals and humans. Microstructure of inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF, connecting occipital and ventro-anterior temporal lobe, including PrC) and fornix (the main HC input/output pathway) correlated with accuracy on odd-one-out judgements involving faces and scenes, respectively. Similarly, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in PrC and HC, elicited during oddity judgements, was correlated with face and scene oddity performance, respectively. We also observed associations between ILF and fornix microstructure and category-selective BOLD response in PrC and HC, respectively. These striking three-way associations highlight functionally dissociable, structurally instantiated MTL neurocognitive networks for complex face and scene perception."

It has been shown, for example, that HC damage leads to impairments in perceiving, learning, and remembering complex scenes, whereas broader MTL damage, affecting both the HC and PrC, results in perceptual and mnemonic deficits for scene, but also face, stimuli (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barense et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Lee et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Mundy et al., 2013</a>).

These findings have been complemented by functional MRI (fMRI) studies showing (a) differential recruitment of the HC and PrC for scene and face discriminations, respectively, including on tasks analogous to those affected in lesion patients (<a href=\"#bib10\">Barense et al., 2010</a>), and (b) modulations of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response by visual feature overlap in both MTL (high &gt; low) and occipito-temporal (low &gt; high) regions (<a href=\"#bib76\">Mundy et al., 2012</a>)."

Emerging hierarchical, representational theories provide a framework for such investigations (<a href=\"#bib44\">Graham et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Saksida and Bussey, 2010</a>); they propose that perceptual difficulties in patients with MTL involvement reflect damage to conjunctive scene and face/object representations stored within the HC and PrC, respectively (<a href=\"#bib77\">Murray et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Graham et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Saksida and Bussey, 2010</a>).

For example, the impact of fornix transection in non-human primates suggests that exchange of information between HC and diencephalic regions is necessary for learning both object-in-place associations and conjunctions of spatial features (<a href=\"#bib40\">Gaffan, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Buckley et al., 2004</a>). Fornix damage in humans also impairs episodic memory, as assessed by standardised neuropsychological tasks (<a href=\"#bib113\">Tsivilis et al., 2008</a>), and fornix microstructure has been shown to correlate with scene recollection (<a href=\"#bib97\">Rudebeck et al., 2009</a>), suggesting a potential convergence between findings in human and non-human primates."

If the HC contains conjunctive scene representations that can sub-serve both scene memory and perception, as predicted by representational accounts, then inter-individual variability in fornix tissue microstructure may partly support interactions between the HC and its interlinked brain regions within the limbic system that, in concert, underlie successful scene discrimination."

This tract serves as the primary input pathway to the antero-medial temporal lobe, including PrC (<a href=\"#bib23\">Catani et al., 2003</a>), and is comprised mainly of long association fibres connecting extrastriate visual areas with regions in ventral anterior temporal (vATL) cortex (<a href=\"#bib61\">Latini, 2015</a>). Representational accounts propose that brain regions within the antero-medial temporal lobe are part of an extended representational system in the visual ventral stream (<a href=\"#bib77\">Murray et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Saksida and Bussey, 2010</a>); in these hierarchical views, object discriminations requiring complex and conjunctive visual representations are supported by the PrC and those based on lower-level perceptual features are dependent on early visual areas (<a href=\"#bib76\">Mundy et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib75\">2013</a>). Given this, microstructural properties of the ILF\u2014a major WM tract of this extended visual stream (<a href=\"#bib73\">Mishkin et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib123\">Yeterian and Pandya, 2010</a>)\u2014could influence representations in PrC that are required to differentiate between complex object and/or face stimuli. Indeed, there is evidence suggesting that ILF microstructure is related to performance in tasks involving face stimuli; for example, individuals with congenital prosopagnosia (CP, a syndrome characterised by impairments in identifying faces) have altered WM microstructure and macrostructure (i.e., volume) relative to matched controls in ILF (<a href=\"#bib110\">Thomas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Gomez et al., 2015</a>). These studies suggest that the ILF may be a key tract in a network supporting the perceptual processing of face stimuli and may, through its antero-medial temporal connections, mediate performance in conjunctive face discriminations impacted directly by damage to vATL regions, such as PrC (<a href=\"#bib63\">Lee et al., 2005a</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2006</a>)."

Unfortunately, however, such a conclusion is limited by two key weaknesses in the literature. First, there has been no <i>double dissociation</i> of the functional contributions of the ILF and the fornix within the same participants. Consequently, it is possible that any purported cognitive dissociations reflect the different tasks and/or methodological approaches used to investigate the fornix/ILF independently. Second, no study has yet manipulated representational content within the same experimental paradigm where cognitive demand and difficulty were also matched, as well as ensuring provision of a stringent control condition in which no statistical association is predicted with either WM tract."

This prediction was based on the distinct structural connections these tracts establish with the HC and vATL, and generated from published theoretical/computational accounts of representational models (<a href=\"#bib25\">Cowell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Elfman et al., 2014</a>). To draw correspondence with lesion studies in animals and humans, and to provide the strongest test of representational accounts, we used a modified odd-one-out task in which mnemonic demand was minimised (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). By applying diffusion tractography methods, we extracted two microstructural measures: mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA). MD (10<sup>\u22123</sup> mm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>) reflects a combined average of axial diffusion (diffusion along the principal axis) and radial diffusion (diffusion along the orthogonal direction), and FA reflects the extent to which diffusion within biological tissue is anisotropic, or constrained along a single axis, and can range from 0 (fully isotropic) to 1 (fully anisotropic). Decreases in MD (and also increases in FA) are associated, typically, with microstructural properties that are considered to support the efficient transfer of information along WM, such as increased myelination and axon density (<a href=\"#bib13\">Beaulieu, 2002</a>; but see; <a href=\"#bib57\">Jones et al., 2013</a>). Based on this, we predicted that individual success on scene oddity would correlate negatively with fornix MD and positively with fornix FA. Conversely, we predicted that accuracy in the face oddity condition would correlate negatively with ILF MD and positively with ILF FA. Furthermore, we hypothesised that measures obtained from these pathways would not be associated with performance on an equally difficult size oddity control condition, which is unaffected following damage to MTL (<a href=\"#bib21\">Buckley et al., 2001</a>)."

This region is known to receive ILF inputs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Gschwind et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Pyles et al., 2013</a>), and in combination with the PrC, supports complex face perception (<a href=\"#bib87\">O'Neil et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib86\">2014</a>).

As one participant's mean FA value for the fornix was lower than three standard deviations below the group mean (SD &lt; 0.25), they were removed in order to reduce the effect of outliers on the subsequent correlational analyses. All analyses reported below, therefore, are based on the remaining 29 participants. The mean and standard deviation for each tract (ILF, fornix) and DTI metric (MD, FA) are shown in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. Correlations were Bonferroni corrected by dividing the 0.05 alpha level by the number of statistical comparisons for each individual DTI measure (i.e., 0.05/3 = 0.017). The 95% confidence interval (CI) for each correlation was derived using a bootstrapping procedure based on 1000 iterations. Individual FA and MD values for each participant (and tract) are available in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Table 2\u2014source data 1</a>.

For example, monkeys with PrC lesions are impaired on oddity tasks when presented with face and object arrays (<a href=\"#bib21\">Buckley et al., 2001</a>); this profile is also seen in patients when damage to the MTL includes PrC (<a href=\"#bib63\">Lee et al., 2005a</a>). By using a similar oddity task here (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barense et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Lee et al., 2005a</a>), our results indicate that the ILF, through its interactions with more posterior face processing regions (e.g., FFA), may be important in facilitating the formation of complex representations \u2018downstream\u2019 in the MTL. This extends previous findings that highlight a functional coupling between anterior temporal lobe regions, such as PrC, and face processing regions of fusiform cortex (<a href=\"#bib74\">Moeller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">O'Neil et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib85\">2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib86\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Anzellotti et al., 2014</a>). The results presented here also go beyond such findings by presenting a \u2018structural realisation\u2019 of this functional connectivity (<a href=\"#bib60\">Kosslyn and Van Kleeck, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Behrmann and Plaut, 2013</a>), that is, a direct relationship between the WM bundle connecting these distributed regions and complex face discrimination. Moreover, we demonstrate that ILF tissue microstructure is associated with face-related BOLD activity in both PrC and FFA. Together, these analyses provide clear links between structure, function, and behaviour, and support the idea that the anatomical connection linking antero-medial temporal cortex (including PrC) and FFA is a critical structure in complex face perception, as suggested by neuropsychological studies (<a href=\"#bib110\">Thomas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Grossi et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "An important question that emerges from these results is how inter-individual variation in behaviour emerges from the interplay between ILF microstructure and functional activity in the face-processing network. Studies exploring the role of functional nodes in antero-medial temporal and occipital temporal cortex suggest a number of possible mechanisms for how these regions might <i>together</i> support face processing. For instance, both antero-medial temporal cortex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Barense et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Freiwald and Tsao, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Collins and Olson, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib122\">Yang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Anzellotti and Caramazza, 2015</a>) and ventral occipital temporal cortex (<a href=\"#bib119\">Winston et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Nestor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Anzellotti et al., 2014</a>) have been shown to contain representations that are invariant to facial transformations (e.g., viewpoint or emotional expression), indicating that these discrete regions may be involved jointly in the online maintenance of viewpoint-invariant face representations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Freiwald and Tsao, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Nestor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Collins and Olson, 2014</a>). Another study that manipulated the visual similarity between face stimuli found that PrC exhibits a greater response to highly overlapping faces, whereas FFA shows the opposite pattern (<a href=\"#bib76\">Mundy et al., 2012</a>), a finding consistent with a posterior-to-anterior hierarchy in which face representations become increasingly complex (<a href=\"#bib99\">Saksida and Bussey, 2010</a>). Furthermore, a recent study reported response suppression for different images of matching identities in antero-medial temporal cortex but not more posterior face-processing regions (<a href=\"#bib122\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). Strikingly, this adaptation effect in anterior temporal lobe was preserved in a prosopagnosic patient with ipsilateral lesions of FFA and \u2018occipital face area\u2019, indicating a potential top\u2013down role of this region in processing face identity. By observing a specific relationship between the ILF and performance on our oddity task in which highly overlapping faces must be discriminated across multiple viewpoints, our results suggest that the connection established by the ILF may be integral for both (a) an effective iterative feedback mechanism between PrC and ventral occipital temporal cortex that allows for online maintenance of identity across visual transformations (<a href=\"#bib36\">Fox et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Freiwald and Tsao, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Nestor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">O'Neil et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib122\">Yang et al., 2014</a>) and (b) the efficient feed forward of stimulus information from fusiform gyrus and extrastriate cortex to antero-medial temporal cortex, which permits fine-grained discrimination across multiple viewpoints (<a href=\"#bib44\">Graham et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Saksida and Bussey, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Fox et al., 2013</a>). This proposed relationship is confirmed by evidence of a strong coupling between ILF MD and face-sensitivity in both FFA and PrC, as well as recent evidence suggesting that patterns of WM connectivity are better predictors of an individual's FFA location than group-derived functional ROIs (<a href=\"#bib101\">Saygin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Osher et al., 2015</a>). These results may also address some inconsistencies in the literature, where associations have been found between face recognition and locally defined ventral temporal pathways but not with long-range ILF (<a href=\"#bib109\">Tavor et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Gomez et al., 2015</a>). As indicated above, it may be the case that tasks probing complex antero-medial temporal representations (e.g., perceptual identity) will reveal stronger associations with long-range ILF connectivity (see also <a href=\"#bib93\">Postans et al., 2014</a>)."

Notably, ILF undergoes protracted development well into adulthood, and these developmental changes in ILF MD are tightly and specifically linked with an age-related increase in the size of the FFA (<a href=\"#bib102\">Scherf et al., 2014</a>). Our findings, together with the refinement of the ILF over an extended developmental period, and its compromise in CP, all point to a potential mechanism in which an extended face network, over the course of experience and maturation, becomes progressively organised and optimised. This may occur via neural activity-dependent mechanisms that can stimulate myelination or myelin remodelling, thereby leading to increased network specialisation (<a href=\"#bib102\">Scherf et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">McKenzie et al., 2014</a>)."

For example, efferent connections from the HC to both the mammillary bodies and the anterior thalamus, via the fornix, have been shown to play a role in scene processing (<a href=\"#bib42\">Gaffan et al., 2001</a>) and object-in-place learning (<a href=\"#bib40\">Gaffan, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Parker and Gaffan, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Buckley et al., 2004</a>). Fornix lesions also cause object-in-place learning impairments above and beyond combined lesions to frontal and inferior temporal (i.e., ventral stream) regions (<a href=\"#bib118\">Wilson et al., 2008</a>). This suggests that visual-spatial inputs from dorsal visual areas (e.g., parahippocampal and posterior cingulate cortices), via the subiculum of the HC, may underpin aspects of scene processing that are independent of interactions between inferotemporal and frontal cortices. These dorsally mediated inputs may, for example, convey spatial, rather than object, feature information, such as orientation, position, and size (<a href=\"#bib22\">Buckley et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib118\">Wilson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Nasr et al., 2014</a>).

Consistent with this, patients with HC damage only show scene oddity impairments when items are presented from different viewpoints (<a href=\"#bib64\">Lee et al., 2005b</a>), and individuals with Alzheimer's disease exhibit greater deficits on scene odd-one-out tasks when different, rather than same, viewpoint scenes are presented (<a href=\"#bib62\">Lee et al., 2006</a>). Likewise, HC damage leads to short-term memory deficits in matching rotated scenes based on topographical information (<a href=\"#bib18\">Bird and Burgess, 2008</a>).

Further, this surprising association was localised in more anterior/intermediate HC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

For instance, it is possible that the reported association emerges from variability in anterior HC activity during rest, rather than during scene oddity judgements. Further, not only is it difficult to define a baseline in HC, but there is also a particularly complex relationship between HC neural activity and the BOLD response (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ekstrom, 2010</a>).

The BOLD signal itself is dependent on the relationship between cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism (<a href=\"#bib38\">Fox and Raichle, 1986</a>), and the assumption that, during neural activity, blood flow outmatches metabolic demands (leading to a relative increase in oxygenated haemoglobin). One possibility, therefore, is that sparser blood supply in the HC (e.g., lower capillary density; <a href=\"#bib20\">Borowsky and Collins, 1989</a>) leads to a decoupling between neuronal activity and BOLD, that is, where oxygen metabolism exceeds local blood flow."

The distinct contributions of HC neuronal activity and fornix microstructure are consistent with several lines of evidence from lesion work in rats. First, that non-fornical HC pathways are also critical for spatial processing (<a href=\"#bib28\">Dumont et al., 2015</a>). Second, that fornix lesions, which impair HC-dependent spatial memory, do not necessarily suppress HC neuronal activity but rather disrupt longer term HC cellular plasticity mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib35\">Fletcher et al., 2006</a>). Third, that fornical fibres may mediate some spatial functions not attributable to the HC (<a href=\"#bib117\">Whishaw and Jarrard, 1995</a>). In summary, our findings confirm that scene processing (and by extension episodic memory) is an emergent property of the functional and structural connectivity between the HC and key cortical and subcortical regions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Graham et al., 2010</a>), mediated in part, but not exclusively, by the fornix."

As different attributes of WM (e.g., axon density, axon diameter, myelin [<a href=\"#bib13\">Beaulieu, 2002</a>], and the manner in which axons are laid out within a given voxel [<a href=\"#bib57\">Jones et al., 2013</a>]) can influence the hindrance and restriction of water, as has been described elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib57\">Jones et al., 2013</a>), the interpretation of DTI and its specific metrics (including MD and FA) is not straightforward. Thus, while we found stronger associations with MD than with FA, we are not yet able to say whether a particular aspect of WM microstructure (e.g., myelin) underpins these differences. Consistent with this, MD and FA are often reported jointly in the literature (<a href=\"#bib72\">Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Gschwind et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Scherf et al., 2014</a>), and like our reported findings, sometimes MD has been shown to have stronger effects than FA.

More specifically, complex face perception is not just a property of the FFA or PrC but emerges from interactions within large-scale integrated neurocognitive networks (<a href=\"#bib70\">Mesulam, 1990</a>, <a href=\"#bib71\">1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Behrmann and Plaut, 2013</a>).

Two faces were the same individual presented from different viewpoints, and the target was a different face presented from a different viewpoint. For the size task, three black squares were presented. The position of the squares on the screen was jittered so that none of the edges lined up along vertical or horizontal axes. On each trial, two of the squares were identical in size and a third square was either slightly larger or smaller. The difference in length between target and non-targets could vary between 9 and 15 pixels. All stimuli were trial-unique (i.e., never repeated once shown in the task)."

                    "text": "The correlation between <i>deactivation</i> of the HC and both fornix FA and accuracy on the scene-oddity task being interpreted as evidence of HC involvement in complex scene perception is counterintuitive and entirely perplexing. The authors make the argument that a unique property of the HC, and the anterior portion of it in particular, is that increased neural activity causes a <i>decrease</i> in the BOLD signal, unlike neocortical regions and even other subregions of the MTL. The authors site a few select studies to support this possibility, including a number of studies that demonstrate reduced HC BOLD signal for various tasks relative to a resting-baseline. First, the latter studies (e.g., <a href=\"#bib108\">Stark and Squire, 2001</a>; Wig et al., 2008) are probably not relevant here, in that the assumption in these cases is that ongoing cognitive processes during \u201cresting-baseline\u201d engage the HC to a greater extent than the constrained tasks of interest (i.e., the idea of HC involvement in the so-called \u201cdefault mode\u201d). Thus, in these cases, a decrease in BOLD activity presumably reflects a <i>relative</i> decrease in HC activity. Contrarily, the authors of the current study argue that scene perception drives HC activity, which results in a reduced BOLD response. To support this possibility, the authors cite a review by Ekstrom (2009), and several studies reviewed therein, that purportedly show decreased BOLD signal accompanying increased LFP and/or neuronal firing rates. However, such results are not robust or consistent, and are typically found under very specific and often highly atypical (e.g., epileptic activity) circumstances. Rather than concluding that the BOLD signal is negatively correlated with neural activity in the HC, as suggested by the authors, Ekstrom (2009) states that: \u201cBOLD changes in the hippocampus correlated weakly or not at all with LFP power changes. We did not find a significant relationship between BOLD activity and neural firing rate [\u2026] our results suggest that the BOLD signal in the human hippocampal area has a more heterogeneous relationship with underlying neural activity than has been described previously in other brain regions,\u201d (quoted from the abstract). Thus, the discussion of this work was somewhat misleading. Moreover, the suggestion that engagement of the HC results in reduced BOLD response is at odds with the vast corpus of cognitive neuroscience literature over the last two decades concerning the role of the HC in cognition. While there are far too many studies that report increased BOLD signal in the HC as a reflection of HC activity to list here, one such example is a previous study (<a href=\"#bib75\">Mundy et al., 2013</a>) with the same last author as the current paper, that appears to completely contradict this notion. In the <a href=\"#bib75\">Mundy et al. (2013)</a> paper, increased BOLD response is reported as a measure of HC activation throughout (see Figures 6, 7, and 8) \u2013 indeed, the abstract of this paper states: \u201c[fMRI] Functional region-of-interest analyses revealed that posterior HC and posterior parahippocampal gyrus showed greater activity [i.e., increased BOLD signal] during scene pattern learning, but not face and dot pattern learning, whereas PrC, anterior HC, and posterior fusiform gyrus were recruited [i.e., increased BOLD signal] during discrimination learning for faces, but not scenes and dot pattern learning. Critically, activity [i.e., increased BOLD signal] in posterior HC and PrC, but not the other functional region-of-interest analyses, was modulated by accuracy (correct &gt; incorrect within a preferred category).\u201d"

Using fMRI, the authors demonstrate that BOLD signal in hippocampus and perirhinal cortex is correlated with accuracy of scene and face oddity judgments.

The authors initially present clear predictions about WM and BOLD, but then present a post-hoc argument that tries to make the case that we should actually expect fornix integrity to correlate with deactivations during scene oddity task performance, rather than positive activation. I am aware of the Ekstrom paper that the authors use to motivate their analysis, but if one takes his argument seriously, then one needs to discard or reinterpret any fMRI study that reports hippocampal activation that is positively related to perceptual or mnemonic processing (e.g., <a href=\"#bib65\">Lee, Scahill, and Graham, 2008</a>). Using this argument really damages the authors' credibility, because the paper certainly does not take the Ekstrom argument into account when interpreting previous fMRI evidence for perceptual processing in the medial temporal lobes. I don't think that the authors need to make sense of this result, and that it would be far preferable for the authors to simply report the direction of the correlation and admit that it's surprising."

For instance, the authors do not clearly describe the visual areas that provide input to the PRC via the ILF. Neuroanatomical context is especially important for motivating the authors\u2019 predictions about the fornix, because it is not clear how the Saksida-Graham model would explain these results. The computational model describes a hierarchy of visual inputs that converge in the PRC and hippocampus, but I do not see how information about visual features would be conveyed via the fornix. The functions of diencephalic inputs are poorly understood, but from what I understand we would expect them to send information about head direction, not features of the visual scene. I think the paper needs to present a clear treatment of the anatomical input that would be conveyed to the hippocampus via the fornix and clarify how this input would be related to the kind of hierarchical visual processing that is proposed in their theoretical framework."

These comparisons would bolster the author's conclusions. Alternatively, it would be useful to know if WM correlations with face and scene oddity hold up when you control for the influence of size oddity performance (i.e. this would show that white matter integrity is predictive of face/scene oddity over and its contribution to lower level visual discriminations)."

This model emphasizes differences at the level of stimulus content represented in perirhinal cortex (PrC) and the hippocampus (HC) that are critical for performance on tasks (mnemonic or perceptual) that require fine-grained discrimination. Specifically, PrC has been proposed to represent complex object information, including faces, whereas the HC purportedly plays a corresponding role for complex scene information. The prediction tested here is that PrC and the HC show distinct connectivity with other brain regions related to performance on perceptual discrimination for such stimuli. The authors examined the relationship between measures of WM microstructure of two fibre tracts, namely the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and the fornix, task-related activity in the PrC and HC, and performance on an oddity task for faces and scenes. The overall pattern of results suggests links between activity in PrC, the ILF and performance on the face discrimination task, as well as links between the HC, fornix, and performance on the scene task."

Also, the matching of task requirements and performance across stimulus categories is a noticeable strength of the current investigation.

The focus on ILF as a marker of connectivity between PrC and the FFA is easily justified, given recent discussions as to the unique contributions of these regions to face processing. However, it's not immediately clear how a focus on the fornix can accomplish similar goals with respect to scene processing. Regions with scene specific responses have also been reported in posterior cortical structures, including the parahippocampal place area (PPA), retrosplenial cortex, and the transverse occipital sulcus (see Nasr et al., NeuroImage, 2013). I was surprised that these regions are not given any consideration in the current study. The authors note that the fornix connects the HC to diencephalic and other cortical structures, but what these structures are, and how they might relate to category-specific processing is not considered. Work by Aggleton and colleagues suggests that cortical targets of the fornix are found extensively in the frontal lobe; it is unlikely that such frontal regions would contribute to scene processing in a manner similar to the FFA's role in face processing. A more revealing analysis for this comparison might focus on connectivity between the HC and the PPA, retrosplenial cortex, and/or the transverse occipital sulcus in relation to performance on the scene discrimination task."

I realize that demonstrating this link isn't the primary objective, but it seems important to first establish this pattern of results by contrasting F&gt;S and S&gt;F, irrespective of WM measures. On a related note, it is unclear why the authors used a probabilistic atlas, rather than an ROI based on this experimental task contrast, to define the FFA in the current study."

Finally, this method was chosen to ensure non-circularity in our BOLD-behaviour and mediation analyses \u2013 i.e. we wanted to ensure that ROIs were independent of the BOLD signal change data that were analysed as part of the mediation analyses (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009)."
