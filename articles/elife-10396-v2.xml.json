Here, we report on how phosphorylation at serine 10 of histone H3 (H3 S10) contributes to this process. Using a fluorescence-based assay to study local compaction of the chromatin fiber in living yeast cells, we show that chromosome condensation entails two temporally and mechanistically distinct processes. Initially, nucleosome-nucleosome interaction triggered by H3 S10 phosphorylation and deacetylation of histone H4 promote short-range compaction of chromatin during early anaphase. Independently, condensin mediates the axial contraction of chromosome arms, a process peaking later in anaphase. Whereas defects in chromatin compaction have no observable effect on axial contraction and condensin inactivation does not affect short-range chromatin compaction, inactivation of both pathways causes synergistic defects in chromosome segregation and cell viability. Furthermore, both pathways rely at least partially on the deacetylase Hst2, suggesting that this protein helps coordinating chromatin compaction and axial contraction to properly shape mitotic chromosomes."

Second, a group of proteins called condensin is responsible for rearranging the compacted chromatin to enforce higher-order structure on the arms of the condensed chromosome (long-range contraction). Further experiments suggest that an enzyme called Hst2 may help to co-ordinate these processes to ensure that chromosomes adopt the right shape before the cell divides. For example, Hst2 ensures that longer chromosomes condense more than shorter ones."

Thus, cells need to fold their genetic material in order to fit it in the interphase nucleus; they need to pack it further during mitosis, in order to move sister-chromatids safely and symmetrically apart. Furthermore, chromatin folding must be dynamic to allow transcription and replication during interphase, and such that exceptionally large chromosomes can hyper-condense during anaphase in order to fit the size of the spindle and prevent chromosome missegregation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Neurohr et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Titos et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, mitotic condensation also facilitates the decatenation of sister chromatids during their separation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Charbin et al., 2014</a>), and might help to \u2018cleanse\u2019 chromosomes from transcription, replication and cohesion factors (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yanagida, 2009</a>). This is thought to \u2018reset\u2019 the transcriptional state of genes, and prevent displaced factors from interfering with chromosome segregation. However, despite their importance for chromosome segregation, the events ensuring the mitotic condensation of chromosomes are still only partially understood."

In favor of the idea that they play specific roles in chromatin condensation, histone H3 is phosphorylated by aurora B throughout mitosis on a serine at position 10 in most, if not all, eukaryotes. Furthermore, aurora B inactivation leads to chromosome condensation and segregation defects in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lavoie et al., 2004</a>), fission yeast (<a href=\"#bib26\">Petrova et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Tada et al., 2011</a>), HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Tada et al., 2011</a>) and roundworms (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hagstrom et al., 2002</a>). However, the precise role of H3 S10 phosphorylation has remained unclear (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ajiro and Nishimoto, 1985</a>). Recent data demonstrated that H3 S10 phosphorylation promotes the recruitment of the sirtuin-related deacetylase Hst2, which in turn deacetylates, at least, lysine 16 of histone H4 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wilkins et al., 2014</a>). This unmasks a basic patch, allowing H4 to interact with the acidic patch on H2A, most probably on an adjacent nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib30\">Robinson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gordon et al., 2005</a>). Thus, this cascade of events initiated by H3 phosphorylation is thought to tighten the interaction between neighboring nucleosomes. However, all studies carried out so far have failed to reveal strong phenotypes for H3 serine 10 to alanine mutations in a plethora of model organisms (<a href=\"#bib3\">de la Barre et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Afonso et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ditchfield et al., 2003</a>). Furthermore, mutation of this residue in budding yeast did not affect axial contraction of chromosomes and the condensation of the rDNA during regular mitoses (<a href=\"#bib25\">Neurohr et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lavoie et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lavoie et al., 2002</a>). Indeed, the only phenotype identified upon replacement of H3 S10 with alanine in yeast so far is limited to the reduced ability to hyper-condense artificially long chromosomes in order to fit them in the spindle (<a href=\"#bib25\">Neurohr et al., 2011</a>). Thus, it remains unclear whether H3 phosphorylation and H4 deacetylation play any general role in mitotic chromosome condensation."

Condensin is a ring-shaped pentameric protein complex. The core of the ring is formed by two structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) subunits, Smc2 and Smc4. Three non-SMC proteins (Brn1, Ycg1 and Ycs4 in budding yeast) close the ring. The mechanism of condensin loading on chromatin is not understood, but seems to depend on the activity of the kinase aurora B (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lavoie et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Tada et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, the non-SMC subunits were recently shown to directly bind DNA (<a href=\"#bib28\">Piazza et al., 2014</a>), potentially followed by topological entrapment of chromatin inside the condensin ring (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cuylen et al., 2011</a>). How condensin performs its functions in chromosome condensation is unclear, but it has been proposed that condensin\u2019s role might be structural, by inducing loops within the same DNA strand (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cuylen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cuylen and Haering, 2011</a>) or might be enzymatic by promoting positive DNA supercoiling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baxter and Arag\u00f3n, 2012</a>), both assisting in a decrease in length of mitotic chromatids."

To test this idea directly, we asked whether chromatin condensation restricted access for heterologous reporter proteins to their binding sites when those are introduced at a chosen chromosomal locus. Therefore, we used a yeast strain in which a set of Tet operator (TetO) repeats are inserted at the <i>TRP1</i> locus on chromosome IV, 15 kb from <i>CEN4</i>, and constitutively expressing the TetR-mCherry fusion protein, which efficiently binds the TetO repeat. As a consequence, these cells exhibit a red dot in their nucleus throughout the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To test whether the intensity of TetR-mCherry fluorescence possibly varied over the cell cycle, we measured the fluorescence intensity of this dot in G1 cells (unbudded), when the chromatid is decondensed, but not replicated yet, and in late anaphase mother cells, when the chromatid is separated from its sister and has reached full condensation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B</a> and 3C; (<a href=\"#bib25\">Neurohr et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sullivan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">D'Amours et al., 2004</a>) and see below).

Strikingly, mutations that abrogate the mitotic interaction between H2A and H4, such as <i>H3 S10A, hst2</i>\u2206 and the <i>H4</i> \u2206<i>9\u201316</i> mutations, all abolished the reduction in brightness of the TetR-mCherry focus normally observed in anaphase cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

The effect of the <i>H3 S10D</i> mutation was indeed mediated by the recruitment of Hst2, since the <i>hst2</i>\u0394 mutation suppressed it; the <i>H3 S10D hst2</i>\u2206\u00a0double mutant cells showed constitutive high brightness, similar to <i>hst2</i>\u2206 single mutant cells.

First, chromatin compaction might reduce access of DNA-binding proteins, such as TetR-mCherry, to their binding site on DNA and cause their removal, as postulated by the chromosome cleansing hypothesis. Second, chromatin compaction might increase the local packing of TetR-mCherry, leading to quenching of the fluorophore (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lakowicz, 2013</a>); these two first models are depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>.

Furthermore, in this context, quenching might be replaced by F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between the TetR-GFP and TetR-mCherry molecules. Remarkably, unlike the cells expressing only TetR-mCherry, cells expressing both versions of TetR failed to show significant variation of the fluorescence signal for either mCherry or GFP at the TetO array between anaphase and G1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, cleansing and a general change in the local environment of the fluorophores are unlikely to explain the fluorescence drop observed at the TetO array during anaphase in the cells expressing solely TetR-mCherry. Supporting the idea that the intensity drop was due to a quenching effect, FRET was indeed observed upon exciting in the GFP and recording emission in the red channel in cells expressing both TetR-mCherry and TetR-GFP, but not in cells expressing TetR-mCherry alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Moreover, FRET was significantly increased during anaphase compared with G1-phase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>), indicating that the fluorophores are indeed brought in closer proximity during anaphase compared with interphase. We conclude that increased H2A/H4 interaction results in a tighter packing of fluorophores and their quenching, establishing that H2A/H4 interaction leads to compaction of mitotic chromatin in vivo. Furthermore, cell cycle dependent changes of TetR-mCherry or TetR-GFP signals on TetO arrays is a reliable measure of short-range compaction of the underlying chromatin."

During early anaphase, both the TetO and LacO\u00a0array seemed to be compacted to some extent already. As cells progressed to mid anaphase, the <i>CEN4</i>\u00a0proximal TetO arrays seemed slightly more compacted than the distal LacO arrays. In late anaphase,\u00a0the TetO array was already starting to unpack, whereas the LacO remained compacted. Both dots had\u00a0recovered their full intensity in the G1 cells, demonstrating that the intensity decrease in anaphase was\u00a0not solely the consequence of sister-chromatid separation, which is expected to reduce fluorescence\u00a0intensity by half, down to its G1 level until the next S-phase. In the same cells, measuring the TetO-LacO\u00a0distance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, lower panel) indicated that the chromosome first stretched out upon\u00a0anaphase onset, to subsequently contract, reaching their shortest length in late anaphase, as reported\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Guacci et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Harrison et al., 2009</a>).

Thus, we asked whether condensin, which is essential for axial chromosome contraction, contributed to short-range compaction of chromatin. We analyzed the brightness of the TetR-mCherry focus in yeast cells carrying the <i>smc2-8</i> allele, a temperature sensitive mutation in the condensin subunit Smc2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Remarkably, condensin inactivation for 90 min at the restrictive temperature had no effect on the changes in mCherry brightness between the anaphase and G1-phase of the cell cycle, whereas it indeed abrogated shortening of the TetO-LacO distance during anaphase (see below). We therefore conclude that condensin, unlike histone 3 phosphorylation and histone 4 deacetylation, does not promote nucleosome-nucleosome interaction. To test this idea further, we directly probed H2A/H4 interaction by using genetically encoded Ultraviolet (UV)\u00a0inducible crosslinking (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wilkins et al., 2014</a>). We arrested cells in G1 with alpha-factor and released them in the presence of nocadozole under wild type and <i>smc2-8</i> conditions at 37\u00baC. Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) analysis showed that the release and arrest was equally efficient in both cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In wild type cells, as reported before, H4/H2A crosslinking is observed in mitosis and correlated strongly with H4 K16 deacetylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In fitting with the microscopy data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), the crosslinking between H4 and H2A showed no difference in kinetics in the condensin inactivated and in the wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, condensin function is not required for proper, short-range compaction of mitotic chromatin."

Even more remarkably, the <i>H3 S10D</i> phospho-mimicking allele caused chromosome IV to remain in a constitutive state of axial contraction throughout the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). This most probably reflected constitutive recruitment of Hst2 to nucleosomes, since inactivation of the <i>HST2</i> gene in these cells abolished contraction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Thus, boosting the recruitment of Hst2 to chromatin through mimicking constitutive and ubiquitous phosphorylation of H3 promoted both chromatin compaction and axial chromosome contraction, despite the fact that the H3-dependent pathway of Hst2 recruitment is normally dispensable for Hst2 function in axial chromosome contraction during regular mitoses (though, it is essential for adaptive hyper-condensation of an artificially long chromosome). We next sought to determine the role of H4 K16 deacetylation in anaphase chromosome contraction. In accordance with the idea that H4 deacetylation solely plays a role in mitotic chromatin compaction, the <i>H4 K16R</i> allele did not show any significant differences in chromosome contraction compared with wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

Based on this we conclude that H4 deacetylation has no evident role in chromosome contraction.

Thus, we rationalized that Hst2 might not only promote chromosome compaction, but also the function of factors required for the axial contraction of chromatids, such as condensin. To test this notion, we measured the effect of combining the <i>smc2-8</i> mutation with <i>H3</i> and <i>hst2\u2206</i> mutations on axial chromosome contraction during anaphase. As expected, the <i>smc2-8</i> single mutant cells grown at the restrictive temperature failed to axially contract their mitotic chromosomes to wild type levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Deletion of Hst2 in these cells did not exacerbate their contraction phenotype (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), suggesting that condensin and Hst2 might act in the same genetic pathway. In contrast, contraction was restored in the <i>H3 S10D smc2-8</i> double mutant cells. This effect was likely due to boosting Hst2 recruitment and activity since it disappeared in the <i>H3 S10D hst2\u2206 smc2-8</i> triple mutant cells. The effect of H3 most likely depended on the phosphorylation state of S10, since the <i>S10A</i> mutation did not promote contraction. Thus, enhanced activation of Hst2 (<i>H3 S10D</i>) suppressed the effect of the <i>smc2-8</i> mutation on chromatin contraction. Hst2 might mediate the suppression of the contraction defect due to the <i>smc2-8</i> mutation either through activation of a still unknown, alternative contraction pathway or through stimulation of condensin activity such as to restore at least part of its function."

Accordingly, the <i>smc2-8 hst2\u2206</i> double mutants showed the same phenotype. Thus, when the condensin complex was only partially active, cells depended on Hst2 and phosphorylation of histone H3 on S10 for growth. Remarkably, however, the <i>smc2-8 H3 S10D</i> double mutant did not show any altered or improved growth or viability phenotype compared with the <i>smc2-8</i> single mutant cells. It grew reasonably well at 33\u00b0C, while being non-viable at 37\u00b0C. Thus, restoring axial contraction of the chromosomes using the <i>H3 S10D</i> mutation was not sufficient to restore the viability of the cells lacking condensin function. These results are consistent with condensin playing more roles than simply promoting the axial contraction of chromosomes."

The first assay has been used before (<a href=\"#bib26\">Petrova et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Guacci et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Vas et al., 2007</a>), but did not detect a role for histone phosphorylation during regular mitoses (<a href=\"#bib25\">Neurohr et al., 2011</a>). The second assay, introduced here, uses fluorophore quenching to show that nucleosome-nucleosome interaction via H3 phosphorylation and in an Hst2-dependent manner promotes short-range compaction of mitotic chromatin in vivo. This enhanced packing is evidenced by the increased quenching of fluorophores when the chromosome locus is decorated by multiple copies of a fluorescent reporter. The quenching effect was observed similarly well whether we used GFP or mCherry as a fluorophore, and independently of whether it was fused to TetR or to LacI. Though we cannot exclude any local effects of the repetitive nature of the TetO and LacO repeats on chromatin compaction, this novel fluorescence-based assay allows for a simple detection of chromatin compaction states. Beyond promoting chromosome segregation, the exact function of this compaction process will be interesting to address. Our studies establish that chromatin compaction does not displace DNA-associated proteins such as TetR or LacI, as a strong cleansing model would predict. Although they do not exclude that other DNA-binding factors might be removed from the DNA during this process, these data suggest that compaction might serve other functions, such as to change the biophysical properties of the chromatin fiber during segregation. Chromatin compaction might for example affect the local stiffness, elasticity and mechanical resistance of chromosomes to facilitate their decatenation, protection and movement during anaphase."

We propose that this mutation strongly boosts the recruitment and activation of Hst2 all along chromosomes by mimicking the phosphorylated state of histone H3. Two models may explain how <i>H3 S10D</i> elicits its effects. In the first, <i>H3 S10D</i> might lead to hyper-activation of chromatin compaction by over-recruitment of Hst2, such that it might shorten the chromosome axis, independently of the contraction machinery. However, the following observations speak against this idea: I. crosslinking studies do not indicate that <i>H3 S10D</i> increases nucleosome-nucleosome interaction (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wilkins et al., 2014</a>), II. fluorescence quenching of TetR-mCherry and LacI-GFP is not enhanced in the <i>H3 S10D</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>) compared with WT anaphase cells, and III. phosphorylation of H3 S10 does promote the condensin-dependent and Hst2-dependent contraction of artificially long chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Neurohr et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Wilkins et al., 2014</a>). Thus, these data support an alternative model: Hst2 may stimulate condensin function, and hyper-activation of Hst2 by <i>H3 S10D</i> may promote this effect and thereby chromosome arm contraction. To fully distinguish between these two models it will be important to investigate the effect of the <i>H3 S10D</i> mutation on condensin loading and activity. Furthermore, it is important to note that the phenotype of the <i>H3 S10D</i> mutant cells does not seem to reflect physiological conditions taking place during regular mitoses, indicating that the fraction of Hst2 driving wild type chromosome contraction does not depend on H3 S10 phosphorylation (dashed arrow <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, left panel). Rather, it might reflect what happens when both chromosome condensation pathways are hyper-activated, for example under the presence of an artificially long chromosome or in small cells, such as cells grown on a poor carbon source (see below). In any case, it is striking that the <i>H3 S10D</i> strain does not show any obvious defects in growth and viability despite causing chromatin compaction and contraction throughout the cell cycle. Thus, this constitutively condensed state does not impair access and remodeling of chromatin by the transcription and replication machineries during interphase in any major manner."

In this respect, two models could explain the extended <i>TRP1-LYS4</i> distance observed in early anaphase cells. First, this might simply be due to the fact that the anaphase nucleus is more elongated, allowing for the chromosome arm to reach its real extension without being confined in the normally spherical morphology of late anaphase or G1 nuclei. In this scenario, the apparent stretching of the chromosome in early anaphase does not correspond to any rearrangement of the chromatin or changes in contraction, and the impression that contraction follows compaction is an illusion. However, previous work has established that residual cohesion between sister chromatids persists during early anaphase and that this actually causes chromosome stretching during early segregation stages (<a href=\"#bib29\">Renshaw et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Harrison et al., 2009</a>). Thus, a second model would be that maximum contraction is only reached when cohesion is fully resolved, such as to not interfere with cohesion removal. This scenario suggests that chromosome contraction indeed needs to be a late anaphase event to complete chromosome segregation, and that perhaps the compaction events that precede play an important role in facilitating cohesion resolution. This model is attractive because it might more thoroughly account for the molecular events that are actually taking place during anaphase. Understanding how these processes are regulated during early anaphase will be necessary in order to distinguish between the two models. However, one definite conclusion that we can already draw is that arm contraction and chromatin compaction undergo relaxation between late anaphase and G1, since these nuclei are not significantly different in size, and hence the effects observed are not due to confinement alone."

This process strictly depends on the phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10, and the subsequent deacetylation of lysine 16 of histone H4.

This process is completed after chromatin compaction, in late anaphase, but does not strictly require it in order to proceed. Certainly, it will be interesting to clarify this order of event, to dissect how it is controlled, and to determine whether it facilitates the ordered condensation of well-separated chromosome arms. Moreover, the observation that Hst2 contributes to both processes suggests that this enzyme might be pivotal for coordinating compaction and contraction with each other. In this respect, it will be interesting to determine how Hst2 promotes the shortening of the chromosome axis, and whether it does so by directly modulating condensin function."

Indeed, restoring the contraction of the chromosome along its axis in the <i>smc2-8</i> condensin mutant cells by mimicking constitutive H3 phosphorylation did not alleviate the temperature-dependent lethality caused by the <i>smc2-8</i> mutation. Furthermore, although inactivation of the deacetylase Hst2 largely abolished the axial contraction of chromosomes, <i>HST2</i> is not an essential gene. Hence, we suggest that the essential function of condensin is not to mediate long-range contraction. Rather, the essential function of condensin most likely relates to its roles in orchestrating the decatenation of intertwined sister-chromatids (<a href=\"#bib7\">Charbin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Baxter and Arag\u00f3n, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baxter et al., 2011</a>) and the re-annealing of single stranded DNAs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sakai et al., 2003</a>)."

This process depended on condensin and phosphorylation of H3 S10, this last requirement being in contrast to what is observed for the contraction of most wild type chromosomes during regular mitoses. Accordingly, single <i>smc2-8</i> and <i>H3 S10A</i> mutants failed to hyper-contract an exceptionally long chromosome (<a href=\"#bib25\">Neurohr et al., 2011</a>). Since the <i>H3 S10A</i> mutation had no defect on the axial contraction of wild type chromosomes, these results indicated that adaptive hyper-contraction depended more heavily on Ipl1-dependent phosphorylation of S10 on histone H3 than regular chromosome condensation does. Thus, we propose that H3 S10 is hyper-phosphorylated on long chromosomes by Ipl1 located in the center of the spindle (midzone), boosting Hst2 and condensin activity (dotted arrow, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Our observation that mimicking S10 phosphorylation, using the <i>H3 S10D</i> allele, promotes axial shortening in an Hst2-dependent manner is indeed consistent with high levels of S10 phosphorylation promoting the crosstalk between compaction and contraction, via Hst2."

Condensin temperature-sensitive strains were grown in liquid YPD until OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.4 and then transferred to 25\u00baC or 37\u00baC for 90 min prior to imaging. For imaging, cells were resuspended in non-fluorescent medium (Synthetic Defined (SD) minus tryptophan (\u2013\u00a0TRP)) and put on an agar pad. All microscopy was done using a Deltavision microscope (Applied Precision) with a CCD HQ2 camera (Roper), 250W Xenon lamps, Softworx software (Applied Precision), and a temperature chamber set to the desired temperature. For both chromosome contraction and chromatin compaction assays, still images were taken using 750 ms exposure in the Tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC (red)) channel and 500 ms exposure time for the Fluorescein (FITC (green)) over ten Z-slices that were 0.5 \u03bcm apart. Transmission images were taken as a reference. Analysis was done using Fiji image processing software. We defined G1 cells as round cells with no bud and anaphase cells as a budded cell where the red focus leads and the green focus followed. All measurements were done in mother cells. Sum intensity projections were used and a line was drawn between the green and red foci to determine chromosome contraction. For fluorescence intensity, a Region Of Interest (ROI) was drawn around a focus and the integrated density was determined. An identically sized ROI was put in the nucleus to determine the background signal. Background intensity was subtracted from the focus intensity to yield the fluorescent intensity for a given focus. For the example cell in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, 1-hr long movies were taken using slightly modified conditions: 300 ms FITC exposure, 500ms TRITC exposure and eight Z-stacks that were 0.5\u03bcm apart. FRET was done using the same microscope described above. First the FRET channel was recorded using 500 ms exposure in the FITC channel while capturing emission in the TRITC channel. Then, excitation and emission in TRITC was recorded using 500 ms of exposure time. Analysis was done by drawing a ROI around the fluorescent focus in both channels, subtracting the background and determining the ratio between them. At least 50 cells were measured for all conditions. For Ipl1 inactivation, exponentially growing cells were arrested with alpha-factor according to standard protocols and released at 25\u00b0C or 35\u00b0C. To obtain G1 condensation, cells were released for 5 min, to obtain anaphase condensation cells were released for approximately 2\u2009hr at the indicated temperatures before imaging."

Cells were initially inoculated into an overnight culture of standard synthetic complete medium (1.7\u2009g/L Difco Yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5\u2009g/L ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose and 2\u2009g/L amino acid dropout mixture) supplemented with p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (pBPA) at a final concentration of 1 mM. The cultures were then diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.25 in YPD, also supplemented with pBPA. Cells were allowed to double once at permissive temperatures and then alpha-factor was added to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcg/mL (Sigma T6901). Cells were again grown at permissive temperature for 2\u2009hr and the arrest efficiency was monitored by microscopy (arrest stopped when &gt;95% of the cells entered G1 based on morphology). Cells were washed with YPD and then expanded into YPD (without pBPA). At release time zero, nocodazole was added to a final concentration of 1.5 \u03bcg/mL and shifted to the restrictive temperature of 37\u00b0C.

The authors use a clever microscopy based assay to investigate two different processes that contribute to condensation, i.e. of short-range compaction and axial contraction. Compaction, they show, clearly involves histone-histone interactions and is not perturbed in condensin mutants. By contract, axial contraction involves condensin (this was known previously), but they find a new role Hst2 deacetylase in modulating condensin function. They propose a pathway in which two synergistic arms contribute to chromosome condensation during mitosis."

The authors have now developed an ingenious method to monitor chromosome compaction by monitoring fluorescence proteins localized to the TetO or LacO arrays, which show quenching when chromatins become compact. Using this tool, they show that condensin is dispensable for chromosome compaction, but indispensable for chromosome contraction. On the other hand, the pathway required for chromosome compaction is mostly indispensable for chromosome contraction. Thus, the authors propose that there are two mechanisms of mitotic chromosome condensation in budding yeast; one is the chromatin compaction mediated by nucleosome-nucleosome interaction, and the other is chromosome contraction mediated by condensin. Most experiments are well controlled and the conclusions are interesting. However, there are some aspects of the paper that weaken the overall story and that could be improved."

However, it is peculiar that the authors neither analyzed nor mention the contribution of Ipl1 to chromosome compaction/contraction. In fact, the authors previously mention that 'ipl1 inactivation did not abolish anaphase condensation in general (Science, 332, 465-468, 2011)'. How do they reconcile the model shown here (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) with the previous description? This issue should be addressed, probably by performing additional experiments to examine compaction and contraction under ipl1 inactive conditions."

In the final model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), the authors suggest that aurora B regulates chromosome contraction through condensin. In fact, condensin phosphorylation by aurora B and its requirement for anaphase condensation has been demonstrated in fission yeast and humans (Tada et al. Nature 2011). Also in budding yeast, Lavoie et al. (Gene Dev 2004) reported the importance of Ipl1 for anaphase condensation. These papers would be cited in the context of the authors' own results."

Importantly, the H3S10A mutation causes defects only in chromosome compaction, but not in contraction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Curiously, <i>H3S10D</i> (and recruited <i>Hst2</i>) not only sustains compaction, but also restores contraction defects caused by a condensin mutation. These facts cannot be reconciled with the authors' interpretation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). I assume that although <i>H3S10D</i> might cause artificial overloading of Hst2, its loading is usually limited in wild type cells; <i>H3S10p</i>-independent (or residual) Hst2 may act in the condensin contraction pathway."

The topic of chromosome condensation in mitosis is important, as chromosome structure in mitosis remains one of the major unanswered questions in biology. Much of the work here seems to corroborate a previous paper published by Wilkins et al. in Science, including the role of H3 and H4 modification in nucleosome compaction, and the role of H3 S10 and Hst2 in nucleosome compaction and chromosome contraction.

Many possible explanations exist for changes in fluorescence, one of which is compaction. Others include changes in chromatin composition or structure other than compaction that would be equally affected by histone modification. For example, the reduction in fluorescent signal in anaphase is not nearly as pronounced at the <i>LYS4</i> locus as it is at the <i>TRP1</i> locus. No statistical significance is given to the small drop in fluorescence at the <i>LYS4</i> locus. This difference between loci opens up the possibility that the reduction in signal at <i>TRP1</i> represents histone-dependent modification of a special feature of the pericentromere region and/or the kinetochore that is well documented by the Bloom lab. The key to believing these modifications represent global change in nucleosome compaction comes from the UV cross-linking experiment of H2-H4. But the recovery of this crosslink is very inefficient. This poor recovery may reflect inefficiencies of the method as the authors have suggested previously, or that the crosslinks are constrained to a small region of the genome, like the unusual pericentric structure."

It is important to remember that yeast undergoes a closed mitosis such that the nuclear envelope constrains the ability of sequences to separate in space. In G1-metaphase the nucleus is a small ball, which prevents the chromosomes from extending. During anaphase, the nucleus elongates with the elongating spindle before returning to a small ball in late anaphase. As chromosomes are dragged during anaphase in all organisms, they lag behind the centromere and are stretched. In yeast with the elongated nucleus this stretching can manifest itself. When the nucleus shrinks the chromosomes become more confined again. This pattern fits the kinetics of spot separation in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> exactly. Thus it is unclear whether the kinetics of contraction is meaningful, that is the apparent additional contraction in anaphase from that already in anaphase is real. This worry challenges their conclusion that nucleosome compaction precedes contraction. It would also be important to know that whether the small changes in distances between spots reflects a difference in nuclei morphology due differences in the time of the cell cycle. The authors could include a marker for the nuclear envelope."

The authors clearly have shown that they observe differences in contraction between late anaphase and G1 cells that are independent of nuclear morphology. However, they have not shown that the apparent longer distances between their arrays in early and mid-anaphase, which they assume to be less contraction, are not a consequence of changes in nuclear morphology. The chromosome stretching during chromosome movement may reveal the real distance between the arrays along the chromosome axis. When confined to a small round nucleus the distances between the arrays represent the shortest distance between arrays on bent chromosomes. In other words if one could make early and mid-anaphase cells that have small round nuclei like late anaphase and G1 cells, the distances between the arrays would shrink and be the same as late anaphase cells, all of which would be shorter than G1 cells. So contraction is greater in late anaphase than G1 as the authors contend but it is also equally greater in early anaphase and mid anaphase than G1. If so, contraction is happening at the onset of early anaphase concurrent with compaction and not later than it. I can't think of a way for the authors to address this nuclear morphology issue that really dramatically hinders any conclusion from this experimental strategy about contraction in early and mid-anaphase. However this kinetic analysis is really a side embellishment of the major points of the manuscript and as such deleting this section will not detract from the manuscript."

Indeed, we have tried this in the past (unpublished) to visualize equivalent TetO-containing chromatin using PALM, but we encountered technical problems that would require significant optimization. Thus, this approach currently lies beyond the scope of this manuscript. STORM could be a great, equivalent, method, given that we construct the required photo-switchable or -activatable TetR fusion proteins. However, so far we have not been successful with using STORM in yeast cells either. Given the nature of this method, however, we predict that we would not see an increase in fluorophore-quenching in anaphase, since homo-fluorophores are not excited at the same time anymore. It can only be used as a method to measure the size of the LacO and TetO loci and test whether they indeed compact during anaphase.

Thus, the resolution provided by SIM is probably not sufficient to measure the size of the locus and compare between G1 and anaphase. Furthermore, the highly processive nature of the image reconstruction might result in artifacts when combined with quenching. Based on this preliminary experiment we conclude that the changes in fluorescence loci caused by chromatin compaction cannot be resolved by SIM, but rather require optimization of STORM/PALM.

The authors have now developed an ingenious method to monitor chromosome compaction by monitoring fluorescence proteins localized to the TetO or LacO arrays, which show quenching when chromatins become compact. Using this tool, they show that condensin is dispensable for chromosome compaction, but indispensable for chromosome contraction. On the other hand, the pathway required for chromosome compaction is mostly indispensable for chromosome contraction. Thus, the authors propose that there are two mechanisms of mitotic chromosome condensation in budding yeast; one is the chromatin compaction mediated by nucleosome-nucleosome interaction, and the other is chromosome contraction mediated by condensin. Most experiments are well controlled and the conclusions are interesting. However, there are some aspects of the paper that weaken the overall story and that could be improved. 1) This manuscript has resolved important issues regarding chromosome condensation regulated by aurora B/Ipl1 in budding yeast. However, it is peculiar that the authors neither analyzed nor mention the contribution of Ipl1 to chromosome compaction/contraction. In fact, the authors previously mention that 'ipl1 inactivation did not abolish anaphase condensation in general (Science, 332, 465-468, 2011)'. How do they reconcile the model shown here (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) with the previous description?

This is in fact suggests that there are intermediate steps between Ipl1 function in early mitosis and the actual process of full condensation, which is most obvious during anaphase. Therefore, our data suggest that Ipl1 functions essentially in priming chromosomes for condensation. Subsequently, a second step downstream of Ipl1 is required to implement actual chromosome contraction and this second step can be temporally separated from the initial step (i.e. pro/metaphase and early anaphase). For example, the phosphorylation of condensin by Ipl1 may contribute to its loading or prime it for activation, whereas its phosphorylation by Cdk1 might delay its full activation for its role in chromosome contraction (Robellet et al., 2015). In such a scenario, full contraction would rely on Ipl1 activity in metaphase and activation of FEAR, activation of Cdc14 and condensin dephosphorylation on its Cdk1 sites during anaphase. In this scenario, the effects of mutating the Cdk1 sites in condensin might reflect consequences of premature activation rather than lack of activation."

By assessing changes in compaction and contraction in mutants defective in condensin and histone modification, the authors conclude that compaction and contraction happen at different times in the cell cycle and suggest potential different modes of regulation. The topic of chromosome condensation in mitosis is important, as chromosome structure in mitosis remains one of the major unanswered questions in biology. Much of the work here seems to corroborate a previous paper published by Wilkins et al. in Science, including the role of H3 and H4 modification in nucleosome compaction, and the role of H3 S10 and Hst2 in nucleosome compaction and chromosome contraction. In addition the manuscript has some important technical and experimental issues that need to be addressed. 1) The authors use an unusual assay to assess compaction, the reduction in fluorescence of TetR-mCherry and LacO-GFP bound to operator arrays between G1 and late anaphase cells. Many possible explanations exist for changes in fluorescence, one of which is compaction. Others include changes in chromatin composition or structure other than compaction that would be equally affected by histone modification. For example, the reduction in fluorescent signal in anaphase is not nearly as pronounced at the LYS4 locus as it is at the TRP1 locus. No statistical significance is given to the small drop in fluorescence at the LYS4 locus. This difference between loci opens up the possibility that the reduction in signal at TRP1 represents histone-dependent modification of a special feature of the pericentromere region and/or the kinetochore that is well documented by the Bloom lab. The key to believing these modifications represent global change in nucleosome compaction comes from the UV cross-linking experiment of H2-H4. But the recovery of this crosslink is very inefficient. This poor recovery may reflect inefficiencies of the method as the authors have suggested previously, or that the crosslinks are constrained to a small region of the genome, like the unusual pericentric structure.</i> "

It is important to remember that yeast undergoes a closed mitosis such that the nuclear envelope constrains the ability of sequences to separate in space. In G1-metaphase the nucleus is a small ball, which prevents the chromosomes from extending. During anaphase, the nucleus elongates with the elongating spindle before returning to a small ball in late anaphase. As chromosomes are dragged during anaphase in all organisms, they lag behind the centromere and are stretched. In yeast with the elongated nucleus this stretching can manifest itself. When the nucleus shrinks the chromosomes become more confined again. This pattern fits the kinetics of spot separation in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> exactly. Thus it is unclear whether the kinetics of contraction is meaningful, that is the apparent additional contraction in anaphase from that already in anaphase is real. This worry challenges their conclusion that nucleosome compaction precedes contraction. It would also be important to know that whether the small changes in distances between spots reflects a difference in nuclei morphology due differences in the time of the cell cycle.

Regular chromosomes do not depend on H3 S10Ph to contract, whereas the artificially long chromosome does. We showed that adaptive hypercondensation depends on the anaphase activity of the Ipl1 kinase, its midzone localization, H3 S10Ph and on Hst2 function (Neurohr et al., 2011; Wilkins et al., 2014), whereas regular condensation relies on metaphase activity of Ipl1, and Hst2 function. We propose that, in the case of a longer chromosome, more H3 S10 is phosphorylated by midzone Ipl1 in anaphase, which leads to an increased activation of Hst2. As explained in our response to reviewer 2 (point 3), we propose that increase Hst2 activity on chromatin leads to activation of its substrates in the contraction pathway, such as perhaps condensin. In any case, the long chromosome depends more heavily on H3 S10 phosphorylation, compared to WT chromosomes. To clarify these points, we added some explanations to the Discussion section regarding the difference between regular chromosome condensation and adaptive hypercondensation."

Therefore, it is most likely that H3S10D causes either 'over compaction', which by itself somewhat shortens the axis length, or artificial enhancement of the condensin-dependent contraction. The latter case is now properly represented in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> (left panel) by adding a new Hst2 out of H3S10p. This pool of Hst2 might be artificially supplied when H3S10D is expressed. Therefore, the current results do not provide any evidence to support the notion that 'H3S10 phosphorylation is involved in condensin regulation', at least under physiological conditions. This point is very confusing throughout the manuscript. I strongly recommend that the arrows in (H3S10p) Hst2 --&gt; condensin --&gt; contraction in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> (left panel) be removed, as well as the related content in the text.

On the one hand, over-compaction by maximum nucleosome-nucleosome interaction could start to show its effects in contraction, independently of the contraction pathway. On the other hand, Hst2 might activate components of the chromosome contraction pathway (such as condensin). Our current and past experimental data speak against over-compaction since (<a href=\"#bib1\">1</a>) TetO and LacO foci are not dimmer in <i>H3 S10D</i> strains as compared to WT, (<a href=\"#bib2\">2</a>) there is not more crosslinking between H4 and H2A in an <i>H3 S10D</i> strain as compared to WT (Wilkins et al., 2014) and (<a href=\"#bib3\">3</a>) H3 S10 phosphorylation, through Hst2, was shown to be required for adaptive hyper-condensation (Neurohr et al., 2011 and Wilkins et al., 2014). Since our data is supportive of Hst2 and condensin being in the same genetic pathway, we favor the idea that Hst2 might promote condensin activation through a yet unknown mechanism. However, it is crucial to realize, as the reviewer does, that the over-recruitment of Hst2 observed in <i>H3 S10D</i> strains is not relevant for the vast majority of yeast mitoses. Rather, this scenario becomes relevant in the case of smaller yeast nuclei and/or larger yeast chromosomes that require an additional burst of chromosome condensation.

The authors clearly have shown that they observe differences in contraction between late anaphase and G1 cells that are independent of nuclear morphology. However, they have not shown that the apparent longer distances between their arrays in early and mid-anaphase, which they assume to be less contraction, are not a consequence of changes in nuclear morphology. The chromosome stretching during chromosome movement may reveal the real distance between the arrays along the chromosome axis. When confined to a small round nucleus the distances between the arrays represent the shortest distance between arrays on bent chromosomes. In other words if one could make early and mid-anaphase cells that have small round nuclei like late anaphase and G1 cells, the distances between the arrays would shrink and be the same as late anaphase cells, all of which would be shorter than G1 cells. So contraction is greater in late anaphase than G1 as the authors contend but it is also equally greater in early anaphase and mid anaphase than G1. If so, contraction is happening at the onset of early anaphase concurrent with compaction and not later than it. I can't think of a way for the authors to address this nuclear morphology issue that really dramatically hinders any conclusion from this experimental strategy about contraction in early and mid-anaphase.

The reviewer suggests that especially in early anaphase nuclear morphology might play a bigger role in chromosome condensation, since the chromosomes are less constrained in their movement due to a bigger nuclear volume, naturally causing the TetO-LacO distance to be high, though contraction is already present. Although we definitely consider nuclear morphology to play a role in chromosome extension during the early stages of anaphase, we do not think that this is the only factor contributing to it. Specifically, it has been shown that residual arm cohesion in the early stages of anaphase can cause chromosomes to stretch out during exactly this stage (Harrison et al., 2009 and Tanaka et al., 2010). We believe that this phenomenon is causing the very high TetO-LacO distance in early anaphase cells and would like to propose that initiating contraction too early (i.e. in early in stead of late anaphase) might lead to defects in chromosome segregation. However, to properly address this issue the activity of the compaction and contraction machinery in these cell cycle stages would have to be determined with an alternative method.
