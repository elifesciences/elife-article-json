Individuals coinfected with its satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) have more severe disease. Cellular entry of both viruses is mediated by HBV envelope proteins. The pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein is a key determinant for receptor(s) binding. However, the identity of the receptor(s) is unknown. Here, by using near zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification, we revealed that the receptor-binding region of pre-S1 specifically interacts with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157\u2013165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability in supporting both viral infections. Our results demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV."

Individuals coinfected with its satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) have more severe disease. Cellular entry of both viruses is mediated by HBV envelope proteins. The pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein is a key determinant for receptor(s) binding. However, the identity of the receptor(s) is unknown. Here, by using near zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification, we revealed that the receptor-binding region of pre-S1 specifically interacts with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157\u2013165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability in supporting both viral infections. Our results demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV."

Over 350 million people currently are chronically infected and are at high risk for progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, or cancer. More than 50% of liver cancers worldwide are attributed to HBV infection. HBV-related liver diseases remain a major public health problem, causing approximately 1 million deaths per year. Individuals coinfected with HBV and HDV are at greater risk for rapid progression and severe disease (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lavanchy, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hughes et al., 2011</a>). Despite its enormous medical and social relevance, progress in HBV research has been impeded by the lack of understanding of HBV entry by which the virus specifically infects human liver cells. HBV is an enveloped virus containing a small genome of 3.2 kb of partially double-stranded DNA encoding four overlapping reading frames. The HBV envelope consists of the small (S), middle (M), and large (L) envelope proteins, which are multiple transmembrane spanners sharing the same C-terminal domain corresponding to the S protein but differing at their N-terminal domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Heermann et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Seeger et al., 2007</a>). HDV is a small satellite RNA virus of HBV carrying all three HBV envelope proteins and can only propagate when coexisting with HBV. The mechanism of viral entry of HDV is believed to be similar to that of HBV, and HDV has been used as a surrogate for studying HBV infection at the entry level (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barrera et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sureau, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hughes et al., 2011</a>). The L protein and integrity of S protein are critical for HBV and HDV infections. The pre-S1 domain of the L protein is a key determinant for entry of both HBV and HDV and is believed to mediate viral interaction with the cellular receptor(s) on hepatocytes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gripon et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Le Seyec et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chouteau et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blanchet and Sureau, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Le Duff et al., 2009</a>). Although a number of HBV receptor candidates have been reported in the past, none has been confirmed to be functional in supporting viral infection (<a href=\"#bib15\">Glebe and Urban, 2007</a>)."

L-photo-leucine contains a photoactivatable diazirine ring. Irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light at 365 nm induces a loss of nitrogen of the diazirine ring and yields a reactive carbene group with short half-life for covalent cross-linking at nearly zero distance (<a href=\"#bib46\">Suchanek et al., 2005</a>). Primary hepatocytes isolated from treeshrews (<i>Tupaia belangeri</i>), the only species susceptible to human HBV infection other than humans and chimpanzees (<a href=\"#bib45\">Su et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Walter et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Glebe et al., 2003</a>), were used as target cells. To maximize the efficiency of photo-cross-linking, two residues (leu<sub>11</sub> and phe<sub>14</sub>) in a region (aa 9\u201315) known to be critical for viral infection (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schulze et al., 2010</a>) were chosen for substitution with L-photo-leucine. Leu<sub>11</sub> is 100% conserved among HBV genotypes, and the 14th residue is a phenylalanine in most genotypes but a leucine in some HBV strains of genotypes F and G. Changing phe<sub>14</sub> to leucine (F14L) did not significantly affect the binding of HDV virion to primary <i>Tupaia</i> hepatocytes (PTHs) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The activity of the synthesized peptide ligand Myr-47/WT<sub>b</sub> (or WT<sub>b</sub> hereafter) containing photo-leucines at positions 11 and 14 was also confirmed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). WT<sub>b</sub> inhibited HDV binding to PTHs with efficiency comparable to Myr-47/WT that is comprised of all natural amino acids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>). A peptide Myr-47/N9K<sub>b</sub> (or N9K<sub>b</sub> hereafter) similar to WT<sub>b</sub> but with an additional mutation at the ninth residue (N9K) did not block HDV binding to PTHs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). WT<sub>b</sub> but not N9K<sub>b</sub> inhibited viral infection of HBV and HDV on PTHs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Both WT<sub>b</sub> and N9K<sub>b</sub> peptides were myristoylated at the N-terminus and conjugated with a biotin tag on a C-terminal lysine residue (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). N9K<sub>b</sub> differs from WT<sub>b</sub> by only one amino acid but completely lost these blocking activities. Thus, N9K<sub>b</sub> was used as a negative control for WT<sub>b</sub>. In addition, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2D3, which specifically recognizes an epitope adjacent to the critical receptor-binding region of the peptides and shared by both WT<sub>b</sub> and N9K<sub>b</sub>, was developed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

The cross-linked peptide and associated partners were precipitated by streptavidin T1 beads and separated by SDS\u2013PAGE. Western blotting using 2D3 as a probe revealed several bands including a major smeared band with apparent molecular weight of \u223c65 kDa in the WT<sub>b</sub> but not N9K<sub>b</sub> cross-linked sample. The 65-kDa band shifted to \u223c43 kDa upon treatment with the deglycosylation enzyme PNGase F (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, left), indicating that it is highly N-glycosylated. The WT<sub>b</sub> cross-linked protein apparently contained no intermolecular disulfide bonds as it migrated similarly under both nonreducing and reducing conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, right). The non-photoreactive Myr-47/WT peptide but not its N9K mutant peptide effectively competed with WT<sub>b</sub> for cross-linking to the 65-kDa band (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The cross-linked protein from PTHs decreased in abundance rapidly over time during culture (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We also examined primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) in the cross-linking experiments. Bands with slightly smaller molecular weights than those seen in the PTH cells were also observed in PHHs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

(<b>B</b>) Non-photoreactive Myr-47/WT peptide (WT) but not its N9K mutant competed with 200 nM of WT<sub>b</sub> peptide for cross-linking with PTHs in a dose-dependent manner. (<b>C</b>) The abundance of the target protein(s) in PTH cells decreased over time. PTHs on different days of in vitro culturing were photo-cross-linked with 200 nM WT<sub>b</sub>. The cross-linked samples were analyzed by Western blot. The two bands at \u223c65 and \u223c43 kDa were due to incomplete deglycosylation by PNGase F. (<b>D</b>) WT<sub>b</sub> cross-linking with primary human hepatocytes (PHH). Frozen PHH cells were thawed and plated 1 day before cross-linking. With same procedure as in panel A, 200 nM WT<sub>b</sub> but not N9K<sub>b</sub> cross-linked with a glycoprotein of molecular weight at \u223c60 kDa, which shifted to \u223c39 kDa upon PNGase F treatment. (<b>E</b>) Purification of target protein(s) for MS analysis. PTHs photo-cross-linked with 200 nM of WT<sub>b</sub> or N9K<sub>b</sub> peptide were lysed, then the peptides and their cross-linked proteins were purified in tandem with Streptavidin Dynal T1 beads, mAb 2D3 conjugated beads, and Streptavidin Dynal T1 beads in 1\u00d7 RIPA buffer. Extensive wash was applied for each purification step. The samples were treated with or without PNGase F as indicated prior to the last step of Streptavidin beads precipitation. The final purified samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (left). Bracketed areas indicate the bands cut for MS analysis.

The purification procedure included three tandem steps after photo-cross-linking: capturing all biotin-labeled proteins with streptavidin T1 beads, sorting out the target protein(s) with 2D3 antibody affinity beads, and then purifying with streptavidin T1 beads again to remove residual molecules that were not covalently cross-linked with the bait peptide. The purified samples were subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Similar to the Western blotting results with the 2D3 antibody, a \u223c65-kDa protein band was visible by silver staining. The band was also shifted to \u223c43 kDa upon PNGase F treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Both the original 65-kDa and the shifted 43-kDa bands were subsequently excised from the gel and subjected to LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA.

The tandem mass spectra were searched against a <i>Tupaia</i> hepatocyte protein database, which we had established by deep sequencing of the transcriptome (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134</a>).

When tsNTCP mRNA level was reduced to \u223c30% in tsNTCP siRNA-transfected cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, upper-left), total HDV RNA copies were markedly reduced in these cells comparing to those transfected with control siRNA.

The HDV antigenome is a circular replication intermediate that is complementary to the genome. It is not present in the inoculum and only appears in infected cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 1986</a>).

HBV inocula may contain residual HBsAg that can release and interfere with the detection of newly synthesized HBsAg during the first few days of infection. To differentiate de novo HBsAg synthesis from the contaminating inoculum, we assayed HBsAg secretion over time from days 6 to 12 after infection with the culture medium changed every 2\u20133 days. In addition, the kinetics of production of HBeAg with minimal or no residuals in the inoculum was also examined in the same time course experiment.

AAV8-HBV is a recombinant adenovirus-associated virus containing a 1.05\u00d7 overlength HBV genome, for which viral entry is mediated by AAV8 capsid instead of HBV envelope proteins. AAV8-HBV infection of PTHs can nevertheless transduce the HBV genome into cells and lead to subsequent HBV viral antigen expression.

HepG2 cells transiently transfected with either tsNTCP- or hNTCP-supported HBV infection as evidenced by continuous secretion of HBeAg over time and accumulation of HBV replicative intermediate viral RNAs in the infected cells. The entry inhibitor Myr-59 blocked the infection (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). More efficient HBV infection was achieved on stable HepG2-hNTCP cells with about 5\u201310% of the cells being infected as revealed by intracellular staining of HBsAg, whereas there was no HBV infection in the parental HepG2 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). HBV infection in the HepG2-hNTCP stable cells was further evidenced by the continuously increased production of HBeAg during the testing period. HBV entry inhibitors, in particular the Myr-59 peptide and 17B9, efficiently inhibited the infection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The infection efficiency as evidenced by HBV total and 3.5 kb RNA levels correlated with the inoculation dose. Moreover, the formation of HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is a replicative intermediate and transcriptional template for production of viral RNAs, was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). To further demonstrate that the replicative intermediates of HBV were synthesized de novo in HepG2-hNTCP cells after infection, we performed additional time course experiments. HBV viral replicative intermediates, including cccDNA, the 3.5 kb HBV RNA, as well as the total HBV RNA in the HBV-infected HepG2-hNTCP cells were quantified at different time points. The cccDNA became detectable at 24 hr post-infection. It markedly increased at day 3 post-infection and maintained a relatively stable level for the rest of the time points examined, whereas the formation of HBV cccDNA was completely abolished if entry inhibitor Myr-59 was included with the initial virus inoculation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Consistently, HBV RNA levels of the 3.5 kb transcript and the total HBV transcripts in the infected HepG2-hNTCP cells gradually increased during first several days of infection and reached a steady level after day 5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Together these data show that NTCP contributes substantially to HBV infection."

As shown by intracellular staining of HBV core antigen (HBcAg) on day 8 post-infection, about 10% HepG2-NTCP cells were infected at multiplicities of genome equivalents (mge) of 100, which is comparable to the efficiency of HBV infection of PHHs (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast to PHHs, HepG2-NTCP cells propagate in cultures, thus the actual infection efficiency of HepG2-NTCP cells may be more likely than not underestimated by the observed end-point HBcAg staining. We also compared the levels of secreted HBeAg and intracellular viral RNAs in these two types of cells infected with three inoculation doses. The level of secreted HBeAg from HepG2-NTCP appeared to be higher than that in PHHs from two donors, whereas the levels of viral RNAs per nanogram of total cell RNA in both infected cell types are comparable (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

To assess viral particles released from HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP cells, we first quantified viral DNA in the medium collected at different time points after the infection. As indicated by drastic decline of viral DNA level on day 4 post-infection, the majority of residual viruses from inocula were removed by changing the medium and washing during the first few days of infection. The levels of viral DNA in the media resulted from the ongoing infection during days 4\u201313 post-infection were low (equivalent to \u223c1% of input viral DNA copies) despite significant amount of HBeAg secretion during this period. Similarly, only low levels of viral DNA were detected in the medium from HBV-infected PHHs (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, right). It is reasonable to speculate that some host factors that are lacking in cell cultures might be needed for efficient viral particles formation or releasing; or some cellular factors in cultures may hinder these processes during infection. The culture medium collected from infected HepG2-NTCP cells was subsequently tested for infection of PHHs. In line with the low HBV viral DNA level in the medium inoculum, very low number of intracellular HBV total RNA copies were detected in PHHs on day 13 post-infection (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), indicating that only very limited HBV infection might have occurred, which may be attributed to the low multiplicity of infection."

Crab-eating monkey (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) NTCP (mkNTCP) shares high protein sequence identity with hNTCP (96.3%) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, mkNTCP neither supports HDV infection nor pre-S1 peptide (Myr-59) binding (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), consistent with the known narrow species specificity of the virus. We then made a series of human NTCP variants to cover all the different amino acids between hNTCP and mkNTCP. In each variant, two or a few residues were mutated to their mkNTCP counterparts (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Whereas most mutations did not significantly interfere with Myr-59 binding or HDV infection, alteration of five residues of hNTCP between aa 157\u2013165 and its monkey counterpart (from <span class=\"underline\">KG</span>I<span class=\"underline\">VI</span>SLV<span class=\"underline\">L</span> to <span class=\"underline\">GR</span>I<span class=\"underline\">IL</span>SLV<span class=\"underline\">P</span>, distinct residues are underlined) completely abolished Myr-59 binding and the ability to support HDV infection. Remarkably, replacing the motif of aa 167\u2013156 in mkNTCP with the corresponding human residues converted mkNTCP to an efficient receptor for HDV infection (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). All the NTCP variants tested were examined for NTCP expression, and comparable levels of cell surface expression were confirmed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Similar to HDV, HBV infection was also abolished on HepG2 cells expressing hNTCP carrying monkey-like mutations, <span class=\"underline\">GR</span>I<span class=\"underline\">IL</span>SLV<span class=\"underline\">P</span>, while mkNTCP-bearing human residues <span class=\"underline\">KG</span>I<span class=\"underline\">VI</span>SLV<span class=\"underline\">L</span> within the motif of aa 157\u2013165 largely restored HBV infection (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). These data show that residues between 157 and 165 of NTCP are crucial for binding to the receptor-binding region of the pre-S1 domain of the L protein of HBV, and critically contribute to NTCP-mediated HBV and HDV infections."

By performing a series of virological analyses, we showed that silencing NTCP expression markedly inhibited viral infection of HBV and HDV in <i>Tupaia</i> as well as human hepatocytes. Exogenous expression of NTCP rendered nonsusceptible human hepatoma cells susceptible to the viral infections. The authentic viral infections in cells complemented with NTCP were shown by the kinetic analyses of several markers of viral infections, in particular the quantification of newly synthesized viral replicative intermediates. Moreover, the NTCP-rendered infections were blocked by known entry inhibitors. NTCP residues 157 to 165 were identified to be critical for pre-S1 binding and viral infections. These data clearly demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for both HBV and HDV."

In our study, we utilized a short peptide ligand, WT<sub>b</sub>, which was originated from the known receptor-binding domain of the L protein (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barrera et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Glebe et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gripon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Engelke et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Schulze et al., 2010</a>), but with specially designed properties suitable for photo-cross-linking and tandem purification. Two photo-leucines were incorporated into the critical receptor-binding region of WT<sub>b</sub> without interfering with its receptor-binding activity, which allowed highly specific zero distance cross-linking of its direct binding partner(s) but not other neighboring molecules. A biotin moiety of WT<sub>b</sub> facilitated purification of the complex of WT<sub>b</sub> and its binding partner(s) by streptavidin beads. An mAb, 2D3, was developed to recognize WT<sub>b</sub> on an epitope outside the receptor-binding site, serving as a highly specific tool for detection as well as additional affinity purification of the complex. Thus, the binding partner(s) was first cross-linked by WT<sub>b</sub>, and then purified by using streptavidin and 2D3 beads in tandem. The covalent interaction between the WT<sub>b</sub> ligand and its partner(s) enabled a purification process under high-stringency conditions, and efficient isolation was achieved irrespective of the nature of the binding partner(s) even if it is a membrane protein(s) with multiple transmembrane domains, like NTCP identified here."

                        "text": "NTCP (<i>Slc10a1</i>) is the founding member of the SLC10 family of solute carrier proteins. It is a hepatic Na<sup>+</sup> bile acid symporter and is responsible for cotransportation of sodium and bile acids across cellular membranes to maintain the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hagenbuch and Meier, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Stieger, 2011</a>). NTCP is a multiple transmembrane glycoprotein presumed to span the cellular membrane up to 10 times with small extracellular loops (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mareninova et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hu et al., 2011</a>). It is mainly expressed in the liver (<a href=\"#bib44\">Stieger, 2011</a>), consistent with the liver tropism of HBV and HDV. NTCP localizes to the sinusoidal (basolateral) plasma membrane of hepatocytes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stieger et al., 1994</a>), a location that fits well with its receptor role for blood-borne HBV and HDV. Whereas HBV first attaches to hepatocytes mainly through heparan sulfate (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schulze et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Leistner et al., 2008</a>), our data demonstrate that the interaction between NTCP and L protein of HBV is highly specific, and NTCP is crucial for productive viral entry of hepatocytes. Consistent with previous reports on primary cultures of rat hepatocytes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Liang et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rippin et al., 2001</a>), NTCP expression rapidly decreased over time in cultured PTHs after isolation. This may at least partially explain the observations that primary hepatocytes typically remain susceptible to HBV infections in vitro for only a few days after isolation from liver tissues (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gripon et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Seeger et al., 2007</a>)."

Strikingly, despite the high level of protein sequence homology between human and monkey NTCP, the later did not support HBV and HDV infection. Replacing a small motif of aa 157\u2013165 of mkNTCP with the corresponding hNTCP residues converted mkNTCP to a receptor for pre-S1 binding as well as HDV and HBV infection. Further studies are warranted to determine if and how NTCP contributes to the species specificity of HDV and HBV infection in other species. It also remains to be determined if other molecule(s) additional to NTCP contributes to the cellular entry of HBV and/or HDV as a coreceptor(s) or receptor component(s), and if other host factors such as the microenvironment or architecture of hepatocytes in liver, or soluble blood components like those that have been shown to involve in infections of other viruses (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shayakhmetov et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Morizono et al., 2011</a>), contribute to HBV and/or HDV infection."

The newly discovered role of NTCP as an entry receptor for HBV and HDV raises interesting questions regarding its involvement in viral pathogenesis.

For tandem purification, WT<sub>b</sub> or N9K<sub>b</sub> at indicated concentrations was applied to \u223c1 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> hepatocytes plated on collagen-coated dishes.

Digested peptide mixtures containing 0.1% formic acid were loaded onto a 4 cm, 75-\u03bcm inner diameter fused silica capillary column packed with 10-\u03bcm YMC C18 material (YMC, Kyoto, Japan). After desalting, samples were separated with a Waters nano ACQUITY UltraPerformance LC (Waters, United States) and eluted to a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States). The UPLC separation gradient included a 30-min gradient from 0% to 30% acetonitrile, followed by a 10-min gradient to 80% acetonitrile, then 10 min of 80% acetonitrile and back to 0% acetonitrile within 5 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode. Survey MS scans were acquired in the orbitrap with the resolution set to a value of 60,000. Each survey scan (300\u20132000 m/z) was followed by four data-dependent CID tandem mass (MS/MS) scans at 35% normalized collision energy and four data-dependent HCD tandem mass (MS/MS) scans at 40% normalized collision energy with 15,000 resolution in orbitrap. AGC target values were 500,000 for the survey scan, 10,000 for the ion trap MS/MS scan, and 50,000 for the orbitrap MS/MS scan. Target ions already selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 30 s. Tandem mass spectra were searched against the Illumina deep sequencing-determined <i>Tupaia</i> hepatocyte protein database that was concatenated with reversed sequences to estimate false positives and was supplemented with the sequence of bait peptide under the Linux operating system using the ProLuCID (<a href=\"#bib55\">Xu et al., 2006</a>) protein database search algorithm with peptide mass tolerance of \u00b1100 ppm, fragment ion mass tolerance of \u00b1400 ppm, half tryptic specificity, and a static modification of 57.0215 on Cys due to carboxyamidomethylation.

Total cellular protein in the lysate was determined by using Bio-Rad DC Protein assay. About 300 \u03bcg Streptavidin T1 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were then used to pull down surface-biotinylated proteins in the supernatants containing \u223c160 \u03bcg of total cellular protein each sample. After extensive washing with 1\u00d7 RIPA buffer, bound proteins were eluted, and separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently examined with anti-C9 mAb 1D4 by Western blotting. For total NTCP expression, the same transfected cells expressing wild-type or mutant NTCPs were lysed with 1\u00d7 RIPA buffer and treated with PNGase F. Each sample containing same amount of total cellular protein (\u223c8 \u03bcg) were loaded for SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis with mAb 1D4 that recognizes the C9 tag fused at the C-terminus of NTCPs."

The evidence in support of this conclusion includes: a) RNAi of NTCP in the virus-susceptible PTH and PHH cells reduced the virus infection; b) expression of NTCP in HBV non-permissive cell lines render these cells sensitive to HBV and HDV infections; c) swapping experiments showed that grafting of just 9 amino acids of human NTCP into monkey NTCP converts the monkey protein into a functional HBV/HDV receptor; d) The permissiveness of various cell lines to HBV/HDV infection correlates very well with the expression levels of NTCP; e) cross-linking experiments suggest that NTCP binds to the pre-S1 domain of the L envelope protein. The discovery of NTCP as the long-sought receptor for HBV and HDV is a major advance in the field and will have a large impact on both basic and clinical research in viral hepatitis."

We found inoculation of primary human hepatocytes with the culture medium collected from HBV infected NTCP-expressing HepG2 cells only led to very limited infection on PHHs. This very low level of 2<sup>nd</sup> round infection was likely due to limited viral particles released from infected HepG2-NTCP cells. Indeed, only small amount of viral DNA was detected in the culture medium from the infected cells up to 13 days post primary infection. This is similar to HBV infection of PHHs. It has been known that HBV virion release from infected primary hepatocytes in culture is inefficient [1,2], only a level of less than 1% input virions could be detected in the culture medium at the maximum of HBV replication on PHH [2]. In our own experiments, the viral DNA level in culture medium is comparable between infected PHH and HepG2-NTCP cells: in both cultures, a level equivalent to \u223c1% of input viral genome copies was detected. We included these data in new <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>. It is tempting to speculate that some host factors that are lacking in cell cultures <i>in vitro</i> might be needed for efficient viral particles formation or releasing; or some cellular factors in these cultures may hinder these processes during infection. Further studies are required to understand how the interactions between host cells and HBV viruses control the multiple steps of viral propagation and spreading after primary viral entry. The description for the new <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a> was added in the Results section."

The results are shown in new <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, with text added in the Results section. By staining intracellular HBV core antigen (HBcAg) on day 8 post infection (dpi 8), we estimated that about 10% of HepG2-hNTCP cells were infected at multiplicity of genome equivalents (mge) 100. For the two PHHs, the infection efficiency was up to \u223c5% and \u223c10%, respectively. HepG2-NTCP cells but not PHHs propagate in cultures, thus the actual infection efficiency of HepG2-hNTCP cells may be underestimated by the observed infection using HBcAg staining at the endpoint of infection. Nevertheless, the infection efficiency in HepG2-NTCP cells is comparable to PHHs of good quality at the same infection dose under the conditions tested. It has been reported that up to 5% of PHHs could be infected <i>in vitro</i> at \u223c80 mge [3], more efficient infection on primary hepatocytes required HBV of thousands mge [3,4]. This is in contrast to the <i>in vivo</i> infection of HBV in chimpanzees, for which much lower HBV mge is sufficient [5]. It is possible that the microenvironment and architecture of hepatocytes in liver or other host factors, such as soluble ones in blood or other co-receptor/entry components that are lacking or lost in cultures, may also contribute to the efficiency of HBV infection."
