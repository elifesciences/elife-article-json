                    "text": "The adult brain continues to learn and can recover from injury, but the elements and operation of the neural circuits responsible for this plasticity are not known. In previous work, we have shown that locomotion dramatically enhances neural activity in the visual cortex (V1) of the mouse (<a href=\"#bib27\">Niell and Stryker, 2010</a>), identified the cortical circuit responsible for this enhancement (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2014</a>), and shown that locomotion also dramatically enhances adult plasticity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kaneko and Stryker, 2014</a>). The circuit that is responsible for enhancing neural activity in the visual cortex contains both vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and somatostatin (SST) neurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). Here, we ask whether this VIP-SST circuit enhances plasticity directly, independent of locomotion and aerobic activity. Optogenetic activation or genetic blockade of this circuit reveals that it is both necessary and sufficient for rapidly increasing V1 cortical responses following manipulation of visual experience in adult mice. These findings reveal a disinhibitory circuit that regulates adult cortical plasticity."

In previous work, we have shown that locomotion dramatically enhances neural activity in the visual cortex (V1) of the mouse (<a href=\"#bib27\">Niell and Stryker, 2010</a>), identified the cortical circuit responsible for this enhancement (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2014</a>), and shown that locomotion also dramatically enhances adult plasticity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kaneko and Stryker, 2014</a>). The circuit that is responsible for enhancing neural activity in the visual cortex contains both vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and somatostatin (SST) neurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). Here, we ask whether this VIP-SST circuit enhances plasticity directly, independent of locomotion and aerobic activity. Optogenetic activation or genetic blockade of this circuit reveals that it is both necessary and sufficient for rapidly increasing V1 cortical responses following manipulation of visual experience in adult mice. These findings reveal a disinhibitory circuit that regulates adult cortical plasticity."

We also found that running potently activates VIP neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), which in turn inhibit SST inhibitory neurons, thereby disinhibiting the excitatory pyramidal neurons and allowing them to respond more strongly to the visual stimuli for which they are selective (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). We also showed that activating VIP neurons is both sufficient and necessary for enhancing visual responses during running (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, we set out to investigate whether the VIP-SST disinhibitory circuit, rather than general aerobic exercise, is responsible for enhanced cortical plasticity in adult mice."

To test the requirement of VIP-cell synaptic transmission in this model, we first sutured closed one eyelid of VIP-Cre mice at \u223cP24, before the peak of critical period, and then after 4 months injected 1 \u00b5l of AAV-DIO-TeTx or PBS (the vehicle solution for virus) into the binocular zone of V1. After an additional month, we re-opened the closed eye and allowed the animals to run on Styrofoam balls floating on air while viewing a visual stimulus 4 hr per day for 21 days, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kaneko and Stryker, 2014</a>). Cortical responses through two eyes were measured by an experimenter blind to the treatment with intrinsic signal imaging immediately after eye opening and every 7 days during the recovery period (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Intrinsic signal imaging provides a reliable and non-invasive measurement of visual cortical responses to the two eyes, permitting long-term repeated measurement of the same animal to assess plasticity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kaneko et al., 2008</a>). Its results have been extensively validated by electrophysiological recordings in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kaneko et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kaneko and Stryker, 2014</a>). As expected, the deprived-eye visual responses recovered well in the control PBS-injected VIP-Cre mice, and the ocular dominance index (ODI) reached a level that is similar to non-deprived animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>, black traces, compare to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> of <a href=\"#bib19\">Kaneko and Stryker (2014)</a>). In contrast, V1 responses to the deprived eye in the AAV-DIO-TeTx injected animals recovered only modestly, even after 21 days (PBS: 1.82 \u00b1 0.26, TeTx: 1.40 \u00b1 0.20, p = 0.006), with an ODI significantly smaller than in the control animals (PBS: 0.249 \u00b1 0.07, TeTx: 0.083 \u00b1 0.02, p = 0.0004; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>, green traces). Indeed, the poor recovery of AAV-DIO-TeTx injected animals was similar to that of animals that did not run in our previous report (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kaneko and Stryker, 2014</a>), despite the fact that they ran as much as PBS-injected animals (% of running time: TeTx, 67.88 \u00b1 23.6 vs PBS, 68.14 \u00b1 17.57; average running velocity in cm/s: TeTx, 10.78 \u00b1 3.142 vs PBS, 9.43 \u00b1 5.29; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In these animals, as in all of the TeTx-treated animals described below, we noted no obvious changes in temperament or visual behavior; experimental and control animals appeared indistinguishable. Responses of the open-eye were not significantly changed in either group of animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Silencing the transmission of VIP neurons thus abolished the effect of running on adult plasticity in this mouse model of amblyopia by reducing the potentiation of deprived-eye responses during recovery."

                        "text": "During the critical period, 3 days of monocular deprivation (MD) is always sufficient to shift the ocular dominance by reducing the deprived-eye response. In adult mice (&gt;3 months old), 7 days of MD is required for a reliable shift of the ocular dominance, and this shift is produced by increasing the open-eye responses (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sato and Stryker, 2008</a>). Ocular dominance plasticity in adult mice is thus not only much slower but is also qualitatively different from that during the critical period (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sato and Stryker, 2008</a>). To determine whether locomotion would enhance another measure of adult plasticity, we examined changes in visual responses after short-term MD in adult mice that had been reared normally (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As expected, 4-day MD did not significantly change the ODI or the response of either eye in adult animals housed in standard conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, \u2018B6 Home cage\u2019 group). However, 4-day MD combined with daily visual stimulation and running led to enhanced plasticity, including both increases in open-eye responses and decreases in deprived-eye responses (ODI before and after MD: 0.25 \u00b1 0.03 vs 0.09 \u00b1 0.08, p &lt; 0.001; closed-eye response before and after MD: 2.37 \u00b1 0.28 vs 1.95 \u00b1 0.34, p &lt; 0.01; open-eye response before and after MD: 1.41 \u00b1 0.18 vs 1.69 \u00b1 0.25, p &lt; 0.01; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, \u2018B6 VS + run\u2019 group). To examine the role of VIP-cell synaptic transmission in the effect of running on this measure of adult plasticity, we injected AAV-DIO-TeTx into the binocular V1 of adult VIP-Cre mice that had been reared normally and measured the changes in visual responses after 4-day MD combined with daily visual stimulation and running (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). After silencing the synaptic transmission of VIP neurons, running in conjunction with visual stimulation still led to significant depression of the closed-eye response (2.51 \u00b1 0.31 vs 2.23 \u00b1 0.29, p &lt; 0.05; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, \u2018VIP-TeTx VS + run\u2019 group) but failed to potentiate the open-eye response (1.51 \u00b1 0.20 vs 1.53 \u00b1 0.18, p &gt; 0.05; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, \u2018VIP-TeTx VS + run\u2019 group), resulting in a much smaller change of ODI after 4D-MD (0.25 \u00b1 0.03 vs 0.18 \u00b1 0.05, p &lt; 0.05; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, \u2018VIP-TeTx VS + run\u2019 group).

We expressed a variant of channelrhodopsin, ChETA, in VIP neurons of binocular V1 by infecting VIP-Cre mice with AAV-DIO-ChETA-YFP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>); we had previously shown this treatment to enhance visual responses of excitatory cells in stationary mice upon stimulation with blue light (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). We imaged baseline visual responses \u223c2 weeks after viral injection. After implanting the fiber optic cannula in the binocular zone of V1, we sutured one eyelid and connected the cannula to a blue LED light source (20 Hz pulses, 2 s on, 1 s off, 4 hr each day) while the mice were housed in their home cages. No behavioral response to the optogenetic stimulus was evident during delivery. After 5-day MD in conjunction with optogenetic stimulation, we found that the visual response of the open-eye was dramatically potentiated (1.39 \u00b1 0.19 vs 2.28 \u00b1 0.81, p &lt; 0.05; 64 \u00b1 53% fold increase; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, blue traces), significantly shifting ODI (0.22 \u00b1 0.03 vs 0.05 \u00b1 0.08, p &lt; 0.05; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, blue traces), with no significant change in the visual response of the closed eye (2.08 \u00b1 0.12 vs 2.10 \u00b1 0.55, p &gt; 0.05; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, blue traces). To rule out the possibility that the surgery procedure itself leads to enhanced plasticity, we injected VIP-Cre mice with AAV-DIO-TdTomato and subjected these control animals to the same procedure of optogenetic stimulation and 5-day MD (VIP-Tdtm group); no change was found in the open-eye response (1.77 \u00b1 0.37 vs 1.62 \u00b1 0.31, p &gt; 0.05) and ODI (0.19 \u00b1 0.06 vs 0.21 \u00b1 0.05, p &gt; 0.05; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>, red traces). Because AAV-DIO-ChETA may have labeled a small number of non-VIP neurons (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pi et al., 2013</a>), we also examined whether stimulating non-specifically labeled, mostly pyramidal neurons would enhance adult plasticity. We injected AAV-ChETA into VIP-Cre mice and subjected the mice to the same procedure of optogenetic stimulation (pyr-ChETA group). We found no change in the visual responses to the two eyes (open eye: 1.89 \u00b1 0.37 vs 1.78 \u00b1 0.30, p &gt; 0.05; closed eye: 2.64 \u00b1 0.28 vs 2.36 \u00b1 0.18, p &gt; 0.05) or ODI (0.20 \u00b1 0.02 vs 0.19 \u00b1 0.02, p &gt; 0.05) after 5-day MD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>, magenta traces). These results therefore strongly support the hypothesis that activating VIP neurons is sufficient to enhance adult plasticity in the home cage without exercise on the trackball."

We hypothesized that silencing SST neurons directly would be as effective as activating VIP neurons for enhancing adult plasticity.

Inhibitory circuits have been implicated in regulating cortical plasticity. For example, both reducing GABA production and antagonizing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors have been found to enhance adult plasticity in rat visual cortex, possibly by facilitating the potentiation of the input from the open eye (<a href=\"#bib10\">Harauzov et al., 2010</a>). Chronic treatment using the antidepressant drug fluoxetine enhances adult plasticity, accompanied by reduced GABA levels in visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</a>). Our results are consistent with the idea that reduced inhibition is permissive for enhancing adult plasticity."

Our study reveals that disinhibiting pyramidal neurons by either activating VIP neurons or silencing SST neurons also enhances adult plasticity and allows potentiation of open-eye responses in V1, revealing an important role for at least these other major types of inhibitory neurons in cortical plasticity. Recent findings using transplantation of embryonic inhibitory neurons also support a role for SST neurons in cortical plasticity (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tang et al., 2014</a>). It should be noted that there are multiple classes of SST neurons (<a href=\"#bib23\">Markram et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hu et al., 2013</a>), only some of which are suppressed during locomotion (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Reimer et al., 2014</a>).

A number of manipulations in older animals mimic critical period plasticity in their effects on responses to the two eyes: transplantation of embryonic inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#bib37\">Southwell et al., 2010</a>) or acute suppression of the activity of PV neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kuhlman et al., 2013</a>) in mice, or chronic fluoxetine treatment in rats (<a href=\"#bib24\">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</a>). Other manipulations, such as brief dark exposure (<a href=\"#bib12\">He et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Stodieck et al., 2014</a>), repeated MD (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hofer et al., 2006</a>), visuomotor experience (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tschetter et al., 2013</a>), or activation of Rho GTPases (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cerri et al., 2011</a>), lead to a potentiation of open-eye responses that resembles normal adult plasticity following more prolonged MD. The present findings reveal that activation of the VIP-SST disinhibitory pathway is both necessary (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1, 2</a>) and sufficient (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3, 4</a>) for cortical plasticity that potentiates visual responses, and that aerobic exercise is neither necessary nor sufficient. Running, on the other hand, produces both potentiation of open eye responses and depression of responses to the closed eye. Running is associated not only with activation of cortical VIP neurons, but also with increases in multiple neuromodulators including serotonin and noradrenalin (<a href=\"#bib25\">Meeusen and De Meirleir, 1995</a>), both of which have been implicated in modulating adult plasticity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gu, 2002</a>). It is, therefore, not surprising that enhancement of adult plasticity by locomotion is more complex than simply activating VIP-SST disinhibitory circuit, even though silencing VIP transmission abolished the effect of running on enhancing visual response (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). More importantly, the present results also suggest that the potentiation of open-eye response and the depression of closed-eye response are separable from each other and are mediated by distinct mechanisms."

A 470 nm LED (Thorlabs, M470F1) with 400 \u00b5m diameter core fiber output was used to generate blue light. The fiber optic inserted into the cannula was illuminated by the LED through a flexible optic fiber with rotatory joint that allowed the animal to move freely in its home-cage, at a final intensity emitted from the fiber of 15 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. Light pulse stimuli (2 s of 20 Hz (25 ms on, 25 ms off) and 1 s off) were generated by connecting the LED controller with a Master-8 pulse stimulator. The mice were given daily optogenetic stimulation for 4 hr per day for 5 consecutive days."

The brains were removed, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and cut into 30 \u00b5m coronal sections on a frozen sliding microtome (Physitemp Instruments). Floating sections were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in Tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 10% normal goat serum and 1% Tween-100, then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C using in the same solution with the following antibodies: chicken anti-GFP, 1:1000 (Aves); rabbit anti-SST, 1:300 (Swant); and rabbit anti-VIP, 1:1000 (Immunostar). The sections were then washed in TBS with 1% Tween-100 three times for 15 min, incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in blocking solution with 1:1000 each of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-chicken and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit (Life Technologies). The sections were washed in phosphate buffered saline three times for 10 min, mounted on glass slides, dried, and covered with coverslips. Images of the visual cortex were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert-200 micrscope and AxioCam Mrm (Zeiss). Contrast was adjusted in ImageJ."

The present study tests the idea that the activation of the disinhibitory circuit is necessary and sufficient for the enhanced plasticity during recovery from monocular deprivation, and finds convincingly that the two sets of phenomena are causally related. Other aspects of exercise (e.g. stimulation of neurogenesis, activation of other neuromodulatory pathways etc.) have previously been implicated in the effect of exercise on plasticity, so the present results were not a foregone conclusion."

They also show that activating these VIP neurons intensifies ocular dominance plasticity in normally-reared mice that have been monocularly deprived as adults. The authors then show that VIP activity is sufficient to enhance ocular dominance plasticity in adult mice, using optogenetics. Finally, the authors hypothesize that these VIP neurons are acting to inhibit SST neurons; therefore, inactivating SST neurons should also enhance plasticity. The authors perform this experiment in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, and show that this enhances plasticity in adult mice."

We showed in the original manuscript that running enhanced the shift of ocular dominance index after 4-day monocular deprivation in adult mice, by both depressing the closed-eye response and potentiating the open-eye response. Our new results show that the synaptic transmission of VIP neurons is specifically involved in potentiating the open-eye response (new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; original <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> are now <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, respectively), which is the feature characteristic of normal adult ocular dominance plasticity after more prolonged periods of deprivation. Furthermore, in another group of mice, we did longitudinal intrinsic signal imaging, studying individual animals before and after deprivation, to confirm that the open-eye response is potentiated after 5-day monocular deprivation when SST neurons are silenced (now <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). We also revised our manuscript accordingly to include these new findings."
