                    "text": "In a presynaptic nerve terminal, synaptic strength is determined by the pool of readily releasable vesicles (RRP) and the probability of release (P) of each RRP vesicle. These parameters are controlled at the active zone and vary across synapses, but how such synapse specific control is achieved is not understood. ELKS proteins are enriched at vertebrate active zones and enhance P at inhibitory hippocampal synapses, but ELKS functions at excitatory synapses are not known. Studying conditional knockout mice for ELKS, we find that ELKS enhances the RRP at excitatory synapses without affecting P. Surprisingly, ELKS C-terminal sequences, which interact with RIM, are dispensable for RRP enhancement. Instead, the N-terminal ELKS coiled-coil domains that bind to Liprin-\u03b1 and Bassoon are necessary to control RRP. Thus, ELKS removal has differential, synapse-specific effects on RRP and P, and our findings establish important roles for ELKS N-terminal domains in synaptic vesicle priming."

These parameters are controlled at the active zone and vary across synapses, but how such synapse specific control is achieved is not understood. ELKS proteins are enriched at vertebrate active zones and enhance P at inhibitory hippocampal synapses, but ELKS functions at excitatory synapses are not known. Studying conditional knockout mice for ELKS, we find that ELKS enhances the RRP at excitatory synapses without affecting P. Surprisingly, ELKS C-terminal sequences, which interact with RIM, are dispensable for RRP enhancement. Instead, the N-terminal ELKS coiled-coil domains that bind to Liprin-\u03b1 and Bassoon are necessary to control RRP. Thus, ELKS removal has differential, synapse-specific effects on RRP and P, and our findings establish important roles for ELKS N-terminal domains in synaptic vesicle priming."

For the brain to work correctly, it is important that the nerve cells control when and how much neurotransmitter they release. Nerve cells package neurotransmitters into small packets called vesicles. These vesicles can be released at the so-called active zones of each synapse, though only a small subset of vesicles at a synapse are releasable."

ELKS is one of the proteins found at the active zones of nerve cells that release either of the two most common neurotransmitters in the brain: glutamate and GABA. Held et al. have now found that the ELKS protein affects the release of these two neurotransmitters in different ways in the two types of nerve cells. The experiments showed that the number of releasable neurotransmitter-filled vesicles was lower in mouse nerve cells that release glutamate when the genes for the ELKS proteins were deleted in these cells. When the ELKS genes were deleted in the nerve cells that release GABA, the number of releasable vesicles remained the same, though the vesicles were less likely to be released."

Ultimately, this will lead to a better understanding of how information is processed in the brain."

The active zone is a dense protein complex that is attached to the presynaptic plasma membrane and is exactly opposed to postsynaptic receptors (<a href=\"#bib7\">Couteaux and Pecot-Dechavassine, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">S\u00fcdhof, 2012</a>). At the active zone, a small subset of the synaptic vesicles are primed in close proximity to presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels such that the incoming action potential leads to neurotransmitter release with minimal delay. The proteins of the active zone control the size of this pool of primed, readily releasable vesicles (RRP) and the release probability of those vesicles in response to an action potential (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kaeser and Regehr,\u00a02014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alabi and Tsien, 2012</a>). Vesicular release probability, referred to in this paper as P, and RRP size together act to set synaptic strength, sometimes referred to as the synaptic probability of release (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stevens, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</a>). It is well known that RRP size and vesicular release probability differ across synapses, contributing to the generation of unique release properties (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott and Regehr, 2004</a>). In the hippocampus, for example, excitatory and inhibitory synapses have markedly different properties (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kraushaar and Jonas, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Salin et al., 1996</a>). The underlying molecular mechanisms that control RRP and P are still only partially understood, and it is not known what components of the release machinery account for their synapse specific control."

ELKS (also called Erc, CAST, and Rab6IP2) was identified as an active zone protein through its interactions with RIM and named for its high content in the amino acids E, L, K, and S (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nakata et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Monier et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ohtsuka et al., 2002</a>). ELKS has known in vitro interactions with many active zone proteins and additional neuronal proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). It contains a C-terminal region that binds to the PDZ domain of RIM (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ohtsuka et al., 2002</a>) and multiple coiled-coil stretches, which we have subdivided based on homology between the various vertebrate and invertebrate ELKS isoforms into four coiled-coil domains (CC<sub>A</sub>-CC<sub>D</sub>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The coiled-coil stretches bind in vitro to Liprin-\u03b1 (CC<sub>A</sub>-CC<sub>C</sub>, [<a href=\"#bib21\">Ko et al., 2003</a>]), Bassoon (CC<sub>C</sub>, [<a href=\"#bib45\">Takao-Rikitsu et al., 2004</a>]), and \u03b2-subunits of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (CC<sub>D</sub>, [<a href=\"#bib20\">Kiyonaka et al., 2012</a>]). Vertebrate genomes contain two genes for ELKS, <i>Erc1</i> and <i>Erc2</i> (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2002</a>), whereas <i>C.elegans</i> expresses a single ELKS homolog (<a href=\"#bib10\">Deken et al., 2005</a>). <i>D. melanogaster</i> expresses a protein called Brp with homology to ELKS in the N-terminal but not the C-terminal half (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wagh et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kittel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Monier et al., 2002</a>).

In addition, ELKS C-terminal variants determine RIM-binding: the B-isoforms are prominently expressed in the brain and contain the RIM binding site, whereas A-isoforms are expressed outside the brain and lack RIM binding (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kaeser et al., 2009</a>)."

Previous studies showed that ELKS1\u03b1/2\u03b1 boost Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at inhibitory synapses, whereas ELKS2\u03b1 has a regulatory, non-essential function in RRP at these synapses (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kaeser et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, at excitatory ribbon synapses of rod photoreceptors, ELKS2\u03b1/CAST may have a structural role to enhance synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib46\">tom Dieck et al., 2012</a>). These studies suggest the interesting possibility that ELKS may have differential roles in synaptic transmission between synapses. Thus far, ELKS functions have not been studied at small, excitatory synapses, the most abundant synapses in the vertebrate brain. Here, we establish that ELKS is prominently expressed at excitatory hippocampal synapses. In contrast to its roles in enhancing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and release probability at inhibitory synapses, ELKS1\u03b1/2\u03b1 control the size of the RRP at excitatory hippocampal synapses. These data establish that removal of ELKS has differential, synapse-specific effects on RRP size and P: boosting RRP at excitatory synapses but enhancing P at inhibitory synapses. Using structure-function rescue experiments, we then determine the sequences within ELKS required for RRP enhancement at excitatory synapses. Surprisingly, RIM-binding sequences are dispensable for this function, but CC<sub>A</sub>-CC<sub>C</sub>, which include binding sites for Liprin-\u03b1 and Bassoon, control excitatory RRP size. Together, these data show that ELKS selectively controls RRP at excitatory synapses through its N-terminal protein interaction motifs."

We employed immunostainings for ELKS1\u03b1 and ELKS2\u03b1 in cultured hippocampal neurons and analyzed their distribution using confocal microscopy. Both ELKS proteins were present at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and we observed higher intensity staining at excitatory synapses compared to inhibitory synapses for ELKS1\u03b1 and ELKS2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). A recent proteomic study of release site composition found that overall differences between excitatory and inhibitory release sites are small (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boyken et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, however, ELKS1 and ELKS2 were modestly enriched at docking sites for glutamatergic vesicles, consistent with our observation. We next examined the distribution of ELKS relative to one another to determine whether levels of individual ELKS proteins correlate positively or negatively at excitatory or inhibitory synapses. Synaptic markers for either excitatory or inhibitory synapses were used to define regions of interest (ROI) and co-stained for both ELKS1\u03b1 and ELKS2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

Similar to the effect on IPSCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), EPSCs were reduced to ~50% (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). At inhibitory synapses, removal of ELKS resulted in a 30% decrease in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx which led to a reduction in P (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2014</a>) and prolonged IPSC rise times (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). When we examined the EPSC rise times, there was no effect of ELKS1\u03b1/2\u03b1 cDKO (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>), suggesting that ELKS may operate differently at excitatory synapses. To determine whether the deficit in excitatory transmission was presynaptic, we recorded miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in the presence of TTX. mEPSC frequency was reduced by ~50%, but there was no change in mEPSC amplitude, rise time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), or decay kinetics (control \u03c4 = 5.727 ms, n = 16/3; cDKO \u03c4 = 6.321\u00a0ms, n = 15/3; p&gt;0.05). The number and size of excitatory synapses was also unchanged (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, ELKS1\u03b1/2\u03b1 cDKO reduces release from excitatory presynaptic nerve terminals, but the mechanisms may be different from inhibitory synapses."

To directly test the prediction that ELKS functions differently at excitatory synapses, we employed imaging to measure the presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in response to a single action potential (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Neurons were filled with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo-5F and a fixable Alexa-594 dye and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into presynaptic boutons was imaged during a single action potential elicited by a brief current injection through the patch pipette. This method has revealed impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at inhibitory ELKS deficient synapses (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). After the experiment, cells were fixed and stained with GAD67 antibodies to exclude GAD67 positive inhibitory neurons from the analysis. This method reliably distinguished excitatory and inhibitory neurons in hippocampal cultures (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We found that there was no change in peak action potential evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into boutons of excitatory neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). At inhibitory synapses, decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in ELKS deficient neurons resulted in a reduction in P. Thus, our data suggest that initial P may not be affected at excitatory ELKS1\u03b1/2\u03b1 cDKO synapses. Initial P is inversely correlated with paired-pulse ratios (PPR). We measured PPRs of EPSC amplitudes by monitoring <i>N</i>-Methyl-<i>D</i>-aspartate receptor EPSCs (NMDAR-EPSCs) to circumvent the strong reverberant activity that is present in cultured networks when \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors are not blocked (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maximov et al., 2007</a>). Consistent with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data, but different from inhibitory synapses (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2014</a>), there were no changes in PPR in ELKS cDKO neurons across all tested interstimulus intervals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These experiments establish that defects in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and P are unlikely to explain impaired neurotransmitter release at excitatory synapses of ELKS cDKO neurons."

To control for this possibility, we conducted a series of experiments analyzing RRP size and P (as measured by PPRs) for inhibitory and excitatory transmission in the same cultures and matching sample size for all conditions. Both inhibitory and excitatory synapses had a reduction in action potential-evoked EPSC and IPSC amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At inhibitory synapses, ELKS1\u03b1/2\u03b1 cDKO increased the PPR at low interstimulus intervals but had no significant effect on RRP size, consistent with a reduction of P (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>) and with our previous study (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, excitatory synapses in the same cultures showed no change in PPR but a reduction in RRP size (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>). Notably, there was a small, non-significant trend towards a reduced RRP at inhibitory synapses in this experiment. To further rule out that there is a reproducible RRP reduction at inhibitory hippocampal synapses, we conducted a second experiment measuring RRP with a slightly different protocol as described in the methods section and used in (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). Again, no change in RRP was detected (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, in three independent measurements (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and Figure 7F in <a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2014</a>), no reduction in the inhibitory RRP could be detected.

RIM and Munc13-1 were of particular interest, since both proteins localize to the active zone and knockouts of either protein have strong RRP impairments at excitatory hippocampal synapses (<a href=\"#bib4\">Augustin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Calakos et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kaeser et al., 2011</a>). Using confocal microscopy, we quantified the synaptic levels of the active zone proteins ELKS, RIM, Munc13-1, Bassoon, and RIM-BP2 in cDKO and control neurons. With the exception of ELKS, no protein was significantly reduced at excitatory or inhibitory synapses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). These data are consistent with normal electron microscopic appearance of ELKS1\u03b1/2\u03b1 cDKO synapses (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2014</a>) and indicate that ELKS is not essential to recruit the priming proteins RIM and Munc13-1 to the presynaptic nerve terminal."

Peptide injection experiments using the RIM-binding domain of ELKS support a role of the RIM-ELKS interactions in release (<a href=\"#bib45\">Takao-Rikitsu et al., 2004</a>). The CC<sub>D</sub> domain, which is adjacent to the RIM binding sequence, also binds to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel \u03b24 subunits (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kiyonaka et al., 2012</a>).

We generated rescue constructs lacking N-terminal coiled-coils (corresponding to ELKS1\u03b2B) or the central coiled-coil region (\u25b3CC<sub>C</sub>). ELKS1\u03b1B and ELKS1-\u25b3CC<sub>D</sub>B were used as positive rescue controls (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). All rescue constructs were successfully expressed, albeit at variable levels (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Compellingly, neither ELKS1\u03b2B nor ELKS1-\u25b3CC<sub>C</sub> rescued the RRP in ELKS1\u03b1/2\u03b1 cDKO neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The lack of rescue could be due to either a local function of the deleted coiled-coil regions or to a role for these regions in localizing ELKS to synapses. We distinguished between these possibilities by assessing the localization of each rescue construct using confocal microscopy. Since ELKS1\u03b2B lacks the antigen recognized by our ELKS1 antibody we stained for either the HA tag included in all rescue proteins (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) or for ELKS1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E</a>). Synaptic expression of the rescue constructs ranged from 50\u2013200% of wild-type levels of ELKS1. Importantly, all constructs localized to synapses. Thus vertebrate ELKS1 can be localized to synapses likely through multiple redundant interactions. While synaptic levels of rescue ELKS1\u03b1B were low, it rescued entirely. In contrast, ELKS1\u03b2B and ELKS1-\u25b3CC<sub>C</sub> both failed to rescue, but were expressed above ELKS1\u03b1B levels. Removal of ELKS reveals differential impairments of RRP and P at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). To test whether such differential effects are also reflected in the ELKS sequences that mediate rescue at each synapse, we tested whether ELKS1\u03b2B, an ELKS isoform that failed to rescue the excitatory RRP, was sufficient to restore inhibitory synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). ELKS1\u03b2B was able to rescue action-potential evoked IPSC amplitudes, establishing that ELKS\u2019 role in controlling P at inhibitory synapses does not require the N-terminal coiled-coil regions that control the excitatory RRP. Together, these experiments establish that the N-terminal coiled-coil sequences of ELKS1\u03b1 are necessary for ELKS' role in enhancing the RRP at excitatory synapses, but not necessary for localizing ELKS to synapses."

They extend beyond previous understanding of the role of ELKS in supporting presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at inhibitory synapses (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2014</a>) and demonstrate that this is not the primary function across all synapses. Most current molecular models of active zone function imply that active zones operate essentially identically across synapses despite the notion that the parameters they control, RRP and P, vary greatly between different types of synapses. Thus far, this assumption has proven principally true for genetic analyses of active zone protein function. For example, it is widely accepted that Munc13 is required at all synapses to prime vesicles and RIMs anchor and activate Munc13 to support priming (<a href=\"#bib47\">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Andrews-Zwilling et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Deng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Calakos et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Augustin et al., 1999</a>).

Such differences have been observed for roles of Munc13-1 and bMunc13-2 in short-term plasticity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rosenmund et al., 2002</a>). Our data make this possibility unlikely in the case of ELKS, because there is a strong positive correlation between ELKS1\u03b1 and ELKS2\u03b1 levels at all synapses. Furthermore, no ELKS isoform-specific protein interactions are described in the literature, and the interaction sequences are generally well conserved between ELKS1\u03b1 and ELKS2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Monier et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2002</a>)."

                        "text": "Another possibility is that interaction partners of ELKS that mediate RRP control are distributed in a synapse specific fashion, and ELKS protein interactions at the active zone may be engaged differentially depending on the presence of specific interacting proteins. This model is supported by the observation that the sequence requirements for rescue of the excitatory RRP or the IPSC are different. ELKS interacts in vitro with many active zone proteins (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ohtsuka et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</a>). We find that ELKS N-terminal, but not C-terminal, sequences are required for RRP control. These N-terminal sequences have been shown to bind to Liprin-\u03b1 via CC<sub>A</sub>-CC<sub>C</sub> (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ko et al., 2003</a>), to Bassoon via CC<sub>C</sub> (<a href=\"#bib45\">Takao-Rikitsu et al., 2004</a>), and they may mediate binding to Rab6 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Monier et al., 2002</a>). Because constructs including CC<sub>C</sub> but lacking CC<sub>A/B</sub> localize to synapses but do not to rescue, one possible explanation is that Liprin-\u03b1 binding is required for ELKS function in controlling the excitatory RRP. Vertebrate genomes contain four genes encoding Liprin-\u03b1, but it is not known whether Liprin-\u03b1 isoforms are differentially distributed to specific active zones. In fact, it is currently not clear for any of the vertebrate Liprin-\u03b1 isoforms whether there is a tight association with the presynaptic active zone (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zurner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Spangler et al., 2011</a>). Functional roles of vertebrate Liprin-\u03b1 in synaptic transmission are not well understood, but a recent study supports presynaptic roles for Liprin-\u03b12 at hippocampal synapses (<a href=\"#bib42\">Spangler et al., 2013</a>). In invertebrates, Liprin-\u03b1/syd-2 has synaptogenic activities, and effects of a gain of function mutation in syd-2 require ELKS (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dai et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Patel et al., 2006</a>), indicating important synaptic roles for Liprin-\u03b1/ELKS interactions. Thus, these previous studies are consistent with the hypothesis that ELKS controls RRP through Liprin-\u03b1. Nevertheless, it is possible that binding to Bassoon, Rab6, or unknown proteins mediate the role of ELKS in enhancing RRP. A recent proteomic analysis of vesicle docking complexes revealed only modest differences in the composition of docking sites at glutamatergic compared to GABAergic synapses (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boyken et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, however, Bassoon and ELKS were found to be enriched in glutamatergic synapses in this study, perhaps supporting a role for these proteins for promoting excitatory transmission in concert with one another. Furthermore, a recent study showed that Bassoon regulates release indirectly via RIM-BP through a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subunit, which could result in a synapse-specific roles for Bassoon (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davydova et al., 2014</a>). In summary, these studies provide support for the hypothesis that ELKS may operate with Bassoon or Liprin-\u03b1 to promote release in a synapse-specific fashion."

Alternatively, an ELKS scaffolding function may not be detected in our experiments due to redundant scaffolding activities in other proteins, for example \u03b2-ELKS or RIM (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schoch et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kaeser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2014</a>)."

Recent work has achieved better resolution in the analysis of docking by combining high-pressure freezing with EM tomography (<a href=\"#bib14\">Imig et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Siksou et al., 2007</a>). We can currently not rule out the possibility that ELKS1\u03b1/2\u03b1 cDKO causes a subtle vesicle docking phenotype undetectable by the methods used in our previous work. An alternative hypothesis to a reduction of RRP at each excitatory synapse is the possibility that a subpopulation of excitatory synapses is very strongly affected by the removal of ELKS. Because the distribution of ELKS\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0intensity across excitatory synapses has a single peak, it is unlikely that ELKS only operates at a subset of excitatory synapses and that these synapses are silent in the absence of ELKS. However, additional work at clearly defined synapse populations with less heterogeneity than mixed hippocampal cultures will be necessary to address these questions."

Previous work showed that at inhibitory synapses ELKS stimulates release probability (P) by stimulating calcium influx. Here, the authors find that the removal of both ELKS proteins cause a reduction in Readily Releasable Pool (RRP) in excitatory synapses, indicating that the mechanism of action of ELKS proteins at inhibitory and excitatory synapses is fundamentally different. Molecular dissection shows that the three N-terminal, but not the C-terminal, coiled-coils are responsible."

Most importantly, this requires, in our opinion, that key experiments are carried out in parallel at excitatory and inhibitory neurons instead of basing all conclusions on comparing the present data with the previously published work. In the prior J. Neurosci. paper, the conclusion that the RRP was unchanged was based on a low number of cells (and on average the RRP was lower in the cDKO) \u2013 and the finding that increasing calcium concentrations did not rescue release in inhibitory neurons indicates that the RRP must have been lower. Conversely, in the present paper the PPR was actually slightly higher in the cDKO (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), and comparing the change in AP-evoked and sucrose-evoked EPSC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>) seems to indicate that the vesicular release probability is reduced in the cDKO. Moreover, the results with single KOs also indicate that ELKS affect the RRP in inhibitory synapses, as discussed by the authors. Therefore, the question arises whether ELKS has effects on both P and RRP in both types of synapses, but due to a different organization of the two types of terminals, one effect will be more conspicuous in inhibitory synapses, and another effect will be conspicuous in excitatory synapses. In this case, the differences will not be indicative of a different function of ELKS in the two neuronal types. Thus, we recommend parallel experiments of release probability and RRP in excitatory and inhibitory neurons from the same cultures, while matching the powers of the analysis (i.e. similar number of cells in the two types of neurons). Furthermore, the statistical analysis for multiple comparisons is not appropriate and needs to be corrected."

Furthermore, we have included a third independent experiment (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which again failed to detect a significant difference in RRP size at inhibitory synapses. However, as we have pointed out in the Discussion there is clearly some role for ELKS in RRP at inhibitory synapses that our methods cannot easily capture. This is evident in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> titration experiments shown in Liu et al. 2014 and in the ELKS2\u03b1 single cKO analyzed in Kaeser et al. 2009. While we acknowledge and discuss these findings, we do not feel that they negate the main observation that removal of ELKS1\u03b1/2\u03b1 has differential effects on the release properties of different synapses."

Furthermore, at inhibitory synapses the reduction in P is caused by reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx, which is unaffected at excitatory synapses.

Our own previous work has demonstrated that ELKS can regulate the RRP at inhibitory synapses and we cannot entirely rule out small effects on release probability at excitatory synapses in the ELKS cDKO. We can, however, confidently state that removal of ELKS1\u03b1/2\u03b1 has differential effects on the properties of release (i.e. RRP size and release probability) at different synapses. This observation is significant because it is clear that synaptic properties between inhibitory and excitatory synapses are different, but molecular differences at these synapses are not well understood. ELKS removal has differential effects on transmission and thus strongly suggests that some element of the active zone, be it its molecular components or the structural or functional organization of the same components, are different between synaptic subtypes. Our study is one of the first that starts dissecting such differences by manipulations at the molecular level."

A large body of literature supports that synapses are functionally diverse, but the molecular diversity that underlies this functional diversity is not well understood. Even though differences in the molecular make up of release sites between excitatory and inhibitory synapses are currently not well known, the molecular mechanisms behind the functional differences are important to resolve. It is interesting that a recent paper (Boyken et al., 2013) found few differences between docking sites of inhibitory vs. excitatory synapses, but there were differences in their levels of Bassoon, ELKS1, and ELKS2 (see supplemental table 5, Boyken et al., 2013). At this time, no single potential mechanism stands out in our data, and no previous study has found a compelling molecular explanation for the functional differences. We have made an effort throughout the manuscript to thoughtfully address potential mechanisms in experiment (using structure-function rescue, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>) and text. In the revised manuscript, we have added new data to show that the sequences that are necessary to rescue the excitatory RRP are not needed for rescue of the IPSC, further supporting differential functions of ELKS at different synapses. In the Discussion, we have outlined which protein interactions map on these sequences, which gives first hints towards mechanisms."

In order to directly test each individual protein interaction without affecting other functions/interactions of ELKS, exact structural information on the binding sites would be necessary. Unfortunately, structural information on ELKS and its interactions with potential targets such as Liprin-\u03b1 or Bassoon is not available. It is thus not easily possible to dissect roles for potential interactions with precise mutations in the \u03b1-helical coils of ELKS that only affect one interaction at a time. Identification of point mutations to selectively change individual interactions would require a massive screening or structural effort, which is not possible for a revision."
