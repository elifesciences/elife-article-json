How microtubule binding stimulates their ATPase and controls force generation is not understood. To address this fundamental question, we visualized microtubule-bound kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 motor domains at multiple steps in their ATPase cycles\u2014including their nucleotide-free states\u2014at \u223c7 \u00c5 resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. In both motors, microtubule binding promotes ordered conformations of conserved loops that stimulate ADP release, enhance microtubule affinity and prime the catalytic site for ATP binding. ATP binding causes only small shifts of these nucleotide-coordinating loops but induces large conformational changes elsewhere that allow force generation and neck linker docking towards the microtubule plus end. Family-specific differences across the kinesin\u2013microtubule interface account for the distinctive properties of each motor. Our data thus provide evidence for a conserved ATP-driven mechanism for kinesins and reveal the critical mechanistic contribution of the microtubule interface."

How microtubule binding stimulates their ATPase and controls force generation is not understood. To address this fundamental question, we visualized microtubule-bound kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 motor domains at multiple steps in their ATPase cycles\u2014including their nucleotide-free states\u2014at \u223c7 \u00c5 resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. In both motors, microtubule binding promotes ordered conformations of conserved loops that stimulate ADP release, enhance microtubule affinity and prime the catalytic site for ATP binding. ATP binding causes only small shifts of these nucleotide-coordinating loops but induces large conformational changes elsewhere that allow force generation and neck linker docking towards the microtubule plus end. Family-specific differences across the kinesin\u2013microtubule interface account for the distinctive properties of each motor. Our data thus provide evidence for a conserved ATP-driven mechanism for kinesins and reveal the critical mechanistic contribution of the microtubule interface."

A network of filaments called microtubules forms tracks along which so-called motor proteins carry these items. Kinesins are one group of motor proteins, and a typical kinesin protein has one end (called the \u2018motor domain\u2019) that can attach itself to the microtubules. The other end links to the cargo being carried, and a \u2018neck\u2019 connects the two. When two of these proteins work together, flexible regions of the neck allow the two motor domains to move past one another, which enable the kinesin to essentially walk along a microtubule in a stepwise manner."

This cycle is coordinated by binding and breaking down a molecule called ATP, which also provides the energy needed to take the next step. How the cycle of loose and tight microtubule attachment is coordinated with the release of the breakdown products of ATP, and how the energy from the ATP molecule is converted into the force that moves the motor along the microtubule, has been unclear."

Images were taken at different stages of the cycle used by the motor domains to extract the energy from ATP molecules. Although the two kinesins have been thought to move along the microtubule tracks in different ways, Atherton et al. find that the core mechanism used by their motor domains is the same."

This release makes room for a new ATP molecule to bind. The structural changes caused by ATP binding are relatively small but produce larger changes in the flexible neck region that enable individual motor domains within a kinesin pair to co-ordinate their movement and move in a consistent direction. This mechanism involves tight coupling between track binding and fuel usage and makes kinesins highly efficient motors."

Their processivity depends on communication between the two motor domains, which is achieved via the neck linker that connects each motor domain to the dimer-forming coiled-coil (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hackney, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rice et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Tomishige and Vale, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>). In the presence of MTs, ATP binding stimulates neck linker association (docking) with the motor domain towards the MT plus end, while ATP hydrolysis and MT release cause neck linker undocking (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rice et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Vale and Milligan, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Skiniotis et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Asenjo et al., 2006</a>); thus, the neck linker is required for both intra-dimer communication and directionality. However, even when the role of the motor N-terminus in reinforcing neck linker movement via cover neck bundle (CNB) formation is considered (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hwang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Khalil et al., 2008</a>), the contribution of neck linker docking to the force generating mechanism(s) of these kinesins remains uncertain (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rice et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Vale and Milligan, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rice et al., 2003</a>).

However, the neck linker conformation seen in these MT-free structures is not always correlated to the nucleotide bound (<a href=\"#bib83\">Vale and Milligan, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Grant et al., 2007</a>). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has played a major role in elucidating several aspects of MT-bound kinesin mechanochemistry (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sosa and Milligan, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Sosa et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rice et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Skiniotis et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hirose et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kikkawa and Hirokawa, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib67\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Goulet et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2014</a>). Despite these contributions, and despite recent advances in the study of kinesin\u2013tubulin complexes using X-ray crystallography (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gigant et al., 2013</a>), several outstanding questions concerning kinesin mechanochemistry remain. Specifically, the mechanism by which MT binding stimulates the kinesin ATPase and in particular enhances Mg-ADP release by several orders of magnitude is not clear (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hackney, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ma and Taylor, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sindelar, 2011</a>). Although several speculative models have been proposed, an unambiguously interpretable structure of nucleotide-free MT-bound kinesin is currently lacking and is clearly critical in establishing how such transitions are achieved. Such a structure would also provide key insights into how ATP binding is coupled to both neck linker docking and force generation."

Kinesin-1s (Kin1) and kinesin-3s (Kin3) are both important neuronal plus-end directed transport motors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hirokawa et al., 2009b</a>), but recent data suggest that Kin3 rather than Kin1 motors specifically are involved in long distance transport (<a href=\"#bib71\">Soppina et al., 2014</a>). Their motor domains share 41% sequence identity, but profoundly different mechanochemistries\u2014in which Kin1 dimers take processive steps and Kin3 monomers diffuse along MT tracks\u2014have been proposed for these motors (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hirokawa et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sindelar, 2011</a>). Thus, we wanted to investigate these differences and compare the motors side by side. The high quality of our reconstructions, coupled to flexible fitting, enables new insights into the kinesin mechanism. In particular, nucleotide-free reconstructions for both motor domains reveal a conserved mechanism, whereby MT binding stimulates changes at the nucleotide-binding site favouring Mg-ADP release and conformationally primes the motor to receive Mg-ATP. We also show that relatively small structural transitions occur at the nucleotide-binding site on Mg-ATP binding, but that these lead to larger scale conformational changes and neck linker docking. Structural analysis of two different transport kinesins allows a direct comparison of their conserved mechanochemical features and identification of attributes that confer distinctive properties on each motor."

The presence or absence of density for nucleotide in the nucleotide-binding site in each reconstruction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>) is consistent with the well-established sample preparation methods used (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In the Kin3-Mg-ADP reconstruction, the N-terminal half of helix-\u03b14 lies at the back of the nucleotide-binding site where its N-terminal end is partially flexible (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). \u223c50% of the adjacent loop11 is not visible presumably also due to flexibility, and density for this loop is only visible close to the P-loop at the edge of the motor's central \u03b2-sheet. In contrast, density corresponding to loop9 is clearly defined: the 4-turn helix-\u03b13 is broken by a single residue, before two further helical segments are seen, one of which coordinates Mg-ADP, together with switch II (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coureux et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hirose et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kull and Endow, 2013</a>).

Kin3 helix-\u03b14 Glu267 (Kin1 Glu251) also interacts with loop9 Arg216 (Kin1 Arg204), an interaction that also involves loop7 Tyr150 (Kin1 Tyr139; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2012a</a>). Evidence for these residues involvement in MT-mediated Mg-ADP release is provided by structural and biochemical studies and disease-causing patient mutations (*<a href=\"#bib51\">Nitta et al., 2008</a>; \u2020<a href=\"#bib86\">Woehlke et al., 1997</a>; \u2021<a href=\"#bib87\">Yun et al., 2001</a>; \u00a7<a href=\"#bib13\">Ebbing et al., 2008</a>; \u00b6<a href=\"#bib70\">Song and Endow, 1998</a>; \\\\<a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2012a</a>)."

Density corresponding to the rest of loop11 is now also fully visible, such that switch II is seen running from the \u03b2-sheet core past the P-loop. Loop9 has undergone a large conformational change: helix-\u03b13 now terminates after four turns and the resulting elongated conformation of loop9 forms a finger-like extension that reaches towards the nucleotide pocket and the new helical turn in loop11. Density connects this extended form of loop9 and the N-terminus of helix-\u03b14; density also connects the P-loop and loop9 (as previously described for Kif5B; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sindelar, 2011</a>). The Kin1-NN reconstruction shows a very similar configuration at the nucleotide-binding site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This arrangement of the nucleotide\u2013binding loops in both motors is striking because even in the absence of bound nucleotide, the loops adopt a conformation related (but not identical) to that formed when Mg-ATP is bound (<a href=\"#bib56\">Parke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gigant et al., 2013</a>). That is, MT-stimulated Mg-ADP release appears to conformationally prime the switch loops for Mg-ATP binding. The similarity of these reconstructions supports the idea of a conserved mechanism of: (1) MT-induced Mg-ADP release (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and (2) MT priming of the conformation of the nucleotide-binding pocket to receive Mg-ATP in both Kin1s and Kin3s."

In both Kin3 and Kin1, loop9 now reaches further into the nucleotide-binding pocket to cradle the Mg-ATP mimic, enclosing it in a catalytically competent conformation and forming continuous density with the nucleotide and P-loop (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E</a>). The C-terminus of loop11 retains a helical turn conformation similar to that observed in the nucleotide free reconstructions. Density for the N-terminus of loop11 runs from the core \u03b2-sheet past the P-loop and the \u03b3-phosphate mimic. Importantly, however, in comparison to the nucleotide-free reconstruction, the loop11 helical turn shows reduced contact with tubulin and has moved toward loop9 and helix-\u03b16 (see arrow, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E</a>). The \u2018pincer-like\u2019 movement of the switch loops is associated with formation of a prominent connection of density between them and is consistent with a \u2018phosphate tube\u2019 structure similar to that described recently for other kinesins (<a href=\"#bib56\">Parke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sindelar and Downing, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gigant et al., 2013</a>). We note that, although the structure of the mammalian Kin1 Kif5A bound to MT has not previously been determined, our Kif5A reconstruction displays the major features seen in the recently published tubulin dimer-bound Kif5B Mg-ADPAlFx X-ray structure and to previous Mg-ATP analogue Kif5B cryo-EM reconstructions (<a href=\"#bib68\">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib67\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gigant et al., 2013</a>). Overall, in response to the presence of \u03b3-phosphate, loop9 and loop11 draw closer to each other and to helix-\u03b16 in both motors. This movement also reduces the density that connects loop11 with the MT."

In the Kin3-Mg-ADP state, the orientation of helix-\u03b16 with respect to helix-\u03b14 ensures both that helix-\u03b16 cannot fully extend and the neck linker is undocked; this is indicated, first, by a lack of density between helix-\u03b14 and helix-\u03b16, and second by a lack of density along the core \u03b2-sheet (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>).

The relative orientation of these helices ensures that the neck linker remains undocked and flexible; this is again indicated by the gap separating these helices and by density extending from the C-terminus of helix-\u03b16, similar to that described in the Mg-ADP state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The flexible distribution of the N-terminus is also unaltered. The Kin1-NN reconstruction shows an overall similar configuration in the region of helix-\u03b16, with its neck linker undocked and flexible and its N-terminus disordered (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>). However, some family specific differences are apparent, both within the motor domain structure and at the motor\u2013MT interface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). For example, in Kin1 \u03b2-sheet1<sub>abc</sub> appears more compact than in Kin3 because loop2 and loop3 are shorter. In Kin1 helix-\u03b16, differences are present in the charged residues compared to Kin3 (described in more detail below) and, perhaps as a consequence, the C-terminus of Kin1 helix-\u03b16 is connected by less density to the MT surface compared to Kin3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D</a>, arrowhead). Thus, relatively limited conformational changes appear to accompany Mg-ADP release in the vicinity of helix-\u03b16 and the neck linker. This is despite the previously described significant rearrangement of the switch loops at the nucleotide-binding site on the other side of the domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

Compared to the NN reconstructions, helix-\u03b16 and \u03b2-sheet1<sub>abc</sub> have together lifted and rotated away from the MT surface. In the Mg-ATP-like reconstructions, a hydrophobic cavity forms above helix-\u03b14 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kikkawa et al., 2001</a>) because the central \u03b2-sheet has peeled away from its C-terminal end (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E</a>; and <a href=\"#fig3s2 fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3C,D,F,G</a>), helix-\u03b16's C-terminus extends by a turn and inserts into this cavity. In the Kin3-Mg-ATP-like reconstruction, as a result of the repositioning of helix-\u03b16, only a narrow bridge of density connects its N-terminal end with \u03b1\u2013tubulin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, arrowhead). This N-terminal end is more negatively charged than the C-terminal end of helix-\u03b16 that was in contact with the MT surface prior to Mg-ATP binding. In Kin1, density for helix-\u03b16 disconnects from the MT surface altogether (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, arrowhead). Importantly, in both motors, this structural reorganisation allows the neck linker to extend towards the MT plus end and dock along strand-\u03b28 of the central \u03b2-sheet (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C,D,F,G</a>) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rice et al., 1999</a>). The N-termini of both motors are also directed towards the MT plus end, lying across the docked neck linker to form the CNB (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C,D,F,G</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hwang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Khalil et al., 2008</a>).

One important aspect of transmission of this mechanochemical information is that a stable interaction with the MT is sustained. Our data show that several structural elements form apparently invariant contacts with the MT (primarily \u03b2-tubulin) in all the nucleotide states we examined. In the Kin3 reconstructions, density corresponding to helix-\u03b14 runs across the whole motor domain\u2013MT interface (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). At its C-terminal end, density corresponding to the N-terminal portion of the extended Kin3 loop12 sequence is stabilised as a helical turn (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>, pink). However, density corresponding to the middle Kin3-characteristic Lys-rich portion of this loop (the so-called K-loop) is not visible in any nucleotide state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>, pink dotted line). This suggests that this highly basic middle section of loop12 remains mobile even while close to the MT surface (discussed below). The C-terminal end of Kin3 loop12, on the other hand, is visible and is stabilised by interaction with \u03b2-tubulin. Loop12 leads into an interconnected region of contacts between the MT surface and the motor, composed of helix-\u03b15 along with loop8/strand-\u03b25. These elements do not alter their interaction with the MT in the different nucleotide states calculated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Globally, the conformations of both Kin1 and Kin3 in our reconstructions are consistent with motor domain tilting of 12\u201315\u00b0 on Mg-ATP binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In both motors, subtle flexure of the central \u03b2-sheet itself is also apparent on Mg-ATP binding (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) such that loop7 and the bottom of strand-\u03b23 that connects to the P-loop are not superimposable. Differences in the \u03b2-sheet when comparing the Kin3-Mg-ADP and Kin3-NN models are even smaller in comparison (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In myosin, the equivalent structural region undergoes substantial \u03b2-sheet flexure on nucleotide release (backbone RMSD &gt; 3.2 \u00c5, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coureux et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Reubold et al., 2003</a>). However, our data provide no evidence of significant flexing in the kinesin \u03b2-sheet that has been proposed to accompany Mg-ADP release (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kull and Endow, 2013</a>). Furthermore, although the slight \u03b2-sheet bending that occurs when Mg-ATP binds may contribute to force generation as previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gigant et al., 2013</a>), it cannot, by itself, account for the peeling of the \u03b2-sheet that allows neck linker docking."

                                "text": "If motor domain tilt was sufficient to account for the mechanochemical transmission that takes place on Mg-ATP binding, superposition of the \u03b2-sheets of the NN and Mg-ATP structural states would be predicted to bring the motor domains into alignment (apart from helix-\u03b14 and the nucleotide-invariant MT contacts). However, such a superposition shows large residual differences in multiple regions of the motor domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>; depicted as RMSDs between each pair of NN/Mg-ATP models). This clearly demonstrates that the \u03b2-sheet tilting that occurs in the transition from NN to Mg-ATP is not sufficient to describe the conformational changes in either Kin3 or Kin1. This is further emphasized when the Kin3 and Kin1 NN pseudo-atomic models are superimposed on the \u03b2-sheets of their respective ATP-like docked models and compared to the Mg-ATP-like cryo-EM reconstructions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Various parts of the NN models protrude from the density for the ATP-like reconstructions illustrating the poor fit, agreeing with the RMSD calculations, and further supporting their tilt-independent movements (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a> compare to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E</a>). At the nucleotide-binding site, this analysis highlights that movement of loop9 around the bound Mg-ATP is large compared to motor domain tilting. Similarly, while loop11 retains a similar conformation before and after Mg-ATP binding, it does not tilt along with the core \u03b2-sheet but instead moves towards the motor domain core (see <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, helix-\u03b12a and loop5 above the nucleotide-binding site, and helix-\u03b10 below the nucleotide-binding site, accommodate Mg-ATP binding in both motors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Some structural changes are seen in helix-\u03b11, whereas the \u03b2-sheet1<sub>abc</sub> shows clear conformational differences; family-specific loop insertions in loop2 and loop3 particularly exaggerate these movements in Kin3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The expected extension of helix-\u03b16 and neck-linker docking is also highlighted by this analysis. However, it is also apparent that helix-\u03b16 movement cannot be described purely by motor domain tilt, because it also undergoes a translational shift towards the MT plus end, as was recently proposed for Kin1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gigant et al., 2013</a>). The improved resolution of our reconstructions thus allows us to conclude that the conformational changes that underlie force generation in both Kin1 and Kin3 involve: (1) motor domain tilting relative to static MT contacts, but also (2) more complex sets of movements that accommodate Mg-ATP binding and bring about mechanical amplification."

In Kin3s, loop12 mediates 1D diffusion of ADP-bound monomeric and dimeric Kin3s along MTs via flexible, electrostatic interactions with the acidic C-terminal tails (CTTs) of tubulin (<a href=\"#bib52\">Okada and Hirokawa, 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kikkawa et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Soppina et al., 2014</a>).

Our data show clear structural differences between Kin1 and Kin3 at the interface of the acidic tip of \u03b1-tubulin H12 with helix-\u03b16, especially in the Mg-ADP/NN reconstructions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

A direct role for recognition of the \u03b1-tubulin CTT is unlikely given its distance from loop8/strand-\u03b25.

MT binding is sensed by loop11/helix-\u03b14 N-terminus, biasing them towards more ordered conformations. We propose that this favours crosstalk between loop11 and loop9, stimulating ADP release. In the NN conformation, both loop11 and loop9 are well ordered and primed to favour ATP binding, while helix-\u03b16\u2014which is required for mechanical amplification\u2013is closely associated with the MT on the other side of the motor domain. ATP binding draws loop11 and loop9 closer together; causing (1) tilting of most of the motor domain not contacting the MT towards the nucleotide-binding site, (2) rotation, translation, and extension of helix-\u03b16 which we propose contributes to force generation, and (3) allows neck linker docking and biases movement of the 2nd head towards the MT plus end."

Full stabilisation of these elements is not achieved until Mg-ADP is released, and the additional contacts with the MT surface may in particular serve to nucleate the single turn helix in loop11. This is consistent with the well-documented role of loop11 in sensing MT attachment and triggering Mg-ADP release via interactions with \u03b1-tubulin (<a href=\"#bib86\">Woehlke et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Yun et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ebbing et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Uchimura et al., 2010</a>). Loop9 does not directly contact the MT before or after Mg-ADP release but dramatically changes conformation, unfurling, and extending around the nucleotide-binding site. The structured conformations of loop11 and the N-terminus of helix-\u03b14 are sterically compatible with the conformations of loop9 before and after Mg-ADP release\u2014that is, no clashes are seen in either case. However, the extended conformation of loop9 and the ordered conformations of helix-\u03b14/loop11 are likely to be mutually stabilising due to formation of additional contacts, and thereby mediate communication between the nucleotide and MT-binding sites (<a href=\"#bib86\">Woehlke et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Yun et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Farrell et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ebbing et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nitta et al., 2008</a>). Critically, however, the water network coordinating Mg-ADP is stabilized exclusively by the retracted helical conformation of loop9 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The transition towards the extended conformation of loop9 promotes Mg-ADP release by destabilisation of Mg coordination (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nitta et al., 2008</a>). These structural rearrangements therefore indicate that sequential conformational changes of the switch loops in the presence of MTs stimulate Mg-ADP release, the rate-limiting step of motors in solution (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hackney, 1988</a>). These rearrangements allow formation of a nucleotide-free motor that is strongly bound to its MT track (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nakata and Hirokawa, 1995</a>), at least in part due to additional contacts formed between loop11 and the MT."

However, the primed conformation clearly does not lead to neck linker docking in the absence of Mg-ATP, contrary to previous predictions (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nitta et al., 2008</a>). Multiple strands of evidence suggest that the neck linkers of transport kinesins in solution explore both docked and undocked conformations independent of the nucleotide state (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rice et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nitta et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Scarabelli and Grant, 2013</a>). Thus, tight MT binding is critical in strongly biasing neck linker conformation in the absence of nucleotide such that it will be undocked and, in our reconstructions, directed albeit flexibly towards the MT minus end. Interaction of helix-\u03b16 with \u03b1-tubulin's H12 (<a href=\"#bib80\">Uchimura et al., 2010</a>) may therefore help to prevent neck linker docking in the absence of nucleotide, despite changes in the conformations of the switch loops at the active site."

However, the presence of the pre-hydrolysis \u03b3-phosphate of Mg-ATP is critical for the pincer-like movement of loop11 and loop9 towards each other. Along with formation of strong additional contacts between these loops, the helix-\u03b14 N-terminus and the P-loop (see <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#bib56\">Parke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gigant et al., 2013</a>), this new local connectivity induces the larger rearrangements that cause neck linker docking. The resulting conformational changes cannot be described only as a tilt of the motor domain relative to static contacts with the MT including helix-\u03b14; in addition to \u03b2-sheet tilting, multiple changes across the domain reinforce mechanical amplification and neck linker docking when Mg-ATP binds. The resolution of our reconstructions also allows us to detect subtle distortion of the central \u03b2-sheet edges on Mg-ATP binding. However, arguably the most important consequences of Mg-ATP binding are the changes\u2014extension, tilting, and translation\u2014in helix-\u03b16 that allow neck linker docking. This conformation is stabilised by contacts between its N-terminus and elements in the nucleotide-binding pocket (see <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#bib56\">Parke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gigant et al., 2013</a>)."

Thus, the structural basis of ATP-dependent force generation remains a matter of debate in the field (<a href=\"#bib85\">Visscher et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cross and McAinsh, 2014</a>). The conformational changes associated with helix-\u03b16 during the ATPase cycle\u2014in which contacts with the MT formed in the ADP/NN state are broken as Mg-ATP-dependent rotation pulls it away from the MT surface\u2014reinforce neck linker movements and may also contribute to mechanical amplification and force generation. The translation/extension of helix-\u03b16 into the hydrophobic cavity that is created by \u03b2-sheet tilting when Mg-ATP binds may ensure that this tilting is not reversed. Intriguingly, mutagenesis of residues at the helix-\u03b16/neck linker junction has a profound effect on the activity of kinesin monomers (<a href=\"#bib5\">Case et al., 2000</a>), pointing to the importance and likely conservation of structural transitions in this region (<a href=\"#bib4\">Case et al., 1997</a>). Importantly, movement of helix-\u03b16 also relieves steric blocking of neck linker docking and presumably biases the mobile neck linker trajectory. In collaboration with the motor N-terminus, formation of the CNB reinforces the plus end directionality of this bias. Thus, we propose that the helix-\u03b16 is a key mechanical element within the kinesin motor domain, and that its Mg-ATP-dependent movement is essential to plus-end directed stepping."

A detailed reaction mechanism for hydrolysis has been proposed based on the conformations of loop9 and loop11 (a so-called \u2018phosphate tube\u2019) with Mg-ATP-analogue bound (<a href=\"#bib56\">Parke et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with MT binding being important in the catalytic enhancement of kinesins (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ma and Taylor, 1997</a>), this hydrolysis competent configuration of the switch loops is rarely seen in Mg-ATP-analogue kinesin structures in the absence of MTs (e.g., <a href=\"#bib39\">Kikkawa et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nitta et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cochran et al., 2009</a>, with <a href=\"#bib56\">Parke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2013</a> being the notable exceptions); those in complex with tubulin always adopt this configuration (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sindelar and Downing, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Goulet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gigant et al., 2013</a>). On Mg-ADP release, loop9 and loop11 are stabilized into conformations quite close to catalytically competent ones. This suggests that the conformational changes triggered by MT binding that lead to MT-stimulated ADP release also contribute to setting up the catalytic site for ATP hydrolysis. Thus, a subset of mutations in MT-sensing residues in loop11 or which decouple MT affinity and ADP-release also affect MT-stimulated ATP-hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib86\">Woehlke et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Song and Endow, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Yun et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ebbing et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Uchimura et al., 2010</a>). Following hydrolysis and phosphate release, we would predict that the Mg-ADP remaining in the catalytic site causes retraction of loop9, subsequent destabilization of loop11 and the helix-\u03b14 N-terminus, leading to track detachment."

Another prominent idea is that a significant twist of the core \u03b2-sheet caused by MT attachment would promote Mg-ADP release analogous to the equivalent release step in myosin (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coureux et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hirose et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kull and Endow, 2013</a>).

We previously characterised the MT-bound ATPase cycle of human kinesin-5 (Kin5, <a href=\"#bib20\">Goulet et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2014</a>). Although the resolutions of those cryo-EM reconstructions (\u223c10 \u00c5) do not provide the level of detail of the current work, many of our current hypotheses are consistent with a conserved mechanochemistry, specifically conformational coupling of loops9 and 11 to bring about MT-induced Mg-ADP release and Mg-ATP induced neck linker docking. Superimposed on this conserved mechanochemistry, family-specific modifications were also detected; most strikingly for Kin5, these include the proposed role of the Kin5-extended loop5 in controlling nucleotide binding and the stiffer properties of the Kin5 neck linker that undergoes an order-to-order transition on Mg-ATP binding. Family-specific insertions elsewhere in the motor domain are likely to have other modifying roles, such as Kin3's loop12, which enhances the initial interaction between these highly processive motors and their tracks (<a href=\"#bib72\">Soppina and Verhey, 2014</a>). A tantalising hint of how insertions in loop2 may be coupled to MT depolymerisation in for example kinesin-13s (<a href=\"#bib12\">Desai et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Moores et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Asenjo et al., 2013</a>) and kinesin-8s (<a href=\"#bib84\">Varga et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Peters et al., 2010</a>) is provided by its proximity to the MT surface and the mechanical amplifier helix-\u03b16, and by its large displacement on Mg-ATP binding. Future studies at high resolution will provide further insights into the ways this conserved mechanochemistry is modified in diverse functional contexts within the kinesin superfamily."

The phi-angle and thus seam location is determined in pseudo-symmetrical 13 protofilament MTs using projection matching in Spider (<a href=\"#bib17\">Frank et al., 1996</a>). Once approximate alignment parameters are determined and manually verified (based on known values for the MT lattice), local refinement and CTF correction is performed in Frealign (<a href=\"#bib24\">Grigorieff, 2007</a>). Eight rounds of refinement were undertaken and a negative B-factor of \u2212400 was applied to the output reconstruction of round five to escape local minima in the search space; no B-factor was applied in the following three rounds to reduce possible over-fitting (<a href=\"http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/forum\">http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/forum</a>). The angular distribution was isotropic for all data sets and the final reconstructions of the asymmetric unit (\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin heterodimer + kinesin motor domain) were generated using 13 protofilament MT pseudo-symmetry. All final maps were assessed for possible over-fitting during refinement using a high-resolution noise-substitution test (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). Final estimated resolutions for each reconstruction are reported in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and FSC curves are shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Band-pass filtering of these reconstructions using a Fermi temperature of 0.04 was performed in Spider (<a href=\"#bib17\">Frank et al., 1996</a>) between frequencies of 15\u20136 \u00c5 (except for K1 Mg-ADPAlFx-MT reconstruction, where 15\u20137 \u00c5 was used)."

Initial fitting of each model into the respective maps was done using the Chimera <i>fit_in_map</i> tool (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goddard et al., 2007</a>). The best model was selected based on a combination of the cross correlation coefficient (CCC) between each model and the density map and a statistical potentials score (zDOPE; <a href=\"#bib65\">Shen and Sali, 2006</a>). Each map was box-segmented around the motor domain, and the EM density for the tubulin was masked out (using Chimera <i>volume eraser</i> tool). The best fits were further refined with Flex-EM following a multistep optimisation protocol relying on simulated annealing molecular dynamics and a conjugate-gradients minimization applied to a series of subdivisions of the structure into rigid bodies (<a href=\"#bib79\">Topf et al., 2008</a>) as identified by RIBFIND (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pandurangan and Topf, 2012</a>). In order to analyse subtle conformational changes occurring in various regions of the domain in the different nucleotide states, the quality of the final fits was assessed locally with TEMPy (Farabella et al., Unpublished) using the segment based cross-correlation coefficient (SCCC, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Pandurangan et al., 2014</a>)."

Although we can also see that in these reconstructions, the neck linker <i>emerges</i> from the motor domain in the direction of the MT minus end, density corresponding to neck linker is only visible for a few amino acids at its N-terminus; the rest of the neck linker is invisible, presumably due to flexibility.

However, they also demonstrated \u2013 using mutagenesis and protein engineering - that manipulations of the K-loop alone were not sufficient to account for the &gt;100-fold differences in MT association between Kin3 and Kin1: in these experiments, Kin1/Kin3 constructs \u00b1 K-loop showed only 10-fold differences in MT association. Subsequent studies including very recent work from the Verhey group (<a href=\"#bib71\">Soppina et al, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Soppina &amp; Verhey, 2014</a>) have expanded on these conclusions.

Our data cannot provide direct information about the stepping mechanisms of kinesin dimers \u2013 and in particular, many factors can contribute to the extent of processivity.

By their nature, the structure(s) of the motors as they undergo biased diffusion would not be accessible using our averaging methods. In contrast, the conformational changes that we describe depend on the stereospecific interaction of the motors with the MT and are preferentially stabilised by the particular nucleotide bound. The point(s) in the MT-bound ATPase cycle where force is generated and how the neck linker contributes to this remain somewhat disputed in the field, and we have altered the text throughout the manuscript to more accurately reflect this.
