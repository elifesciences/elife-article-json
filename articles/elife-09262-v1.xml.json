However, the properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that mediate this effect remain unclear. Here, using hippocampal neurons labeled with the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> probes Fluo-4 or GCAMP5, we visualized action potential-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in dendritic regions adjacent to fluorescently labeled presynaptic boutons in physiological levels of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients required NMDA receptor activity, and their propensity correlated with acute or genetically induced changes in spontaneous neurotransmitter release. In contrast, they were insensitive to blockers of AMPA receptors, L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, or group I mGluRs. However, inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release suppressed these transients and elicited synaptic scaling, a process which required protein translation and eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase activity. These results support a critical role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in amplifying NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at rest for the maintenance of synaptic homeostasis."
