Endocytosed SV can travel directly into the recycling pool or recycle through endosomes but little is known about the molecular actors regulating the switch between these SV recycling routes. ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) is a small GTPase known to participate in constitutive trafficking between plasma membrane and early endosomes. Here, we have morphologically and functionally investigated Arf6-silenced hippocampal synapses and found an activity dependent accumulation of synaptic endosome-like organelles and increased release-competent docked SVs. These features were phenocopied by pharmacological blockage of Arf6 activation. The data reveal an unexpected role for this small GTPase in reducing the size of the readily releasable pool of SVs and in channeling retrieved SVs toward direct recycling rather than endosomal sorting. We propose that Arf6 acts at the presynapse to define the fate of an endocytosed SV."

Endocytosed SV can travel directly into the recycling pool or recycle through endosomes but little is known about the molecular actors regulating the switch between these SV recycling routes. ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) is a small GTPase known to participate in constitutive trafficking between plasma membrane and early endosomes. Here, we have morphologically and functionally investigated Arf6-silenced hippocampal synapses and found an activity dependent accumulation of synaptic endosome-like organelles and increased release-competent docked SVs. These features were phenocopied by pharmacological blockage of Arf6 activation. The data reveal an unexpected role for this small GTPase in reducing the size of the readily releasable pool of SVs and in channeling retrieved SVs toward direct recycling rather than endosomal sorting. We propose that Arf6 acts at the presynapse to define the fate of an endocytosed SV."

The existence of endosome-like compartments has been demonstrated at the synapse since the pioneering experiments on synapse ultrastructure (<a href=\"#bib16\">Heuser and Reese, 1973</a>), but their functional role in SV cycling is highly debated and the molecular and signaling pathways that define the fate of an endocytosed SV are still largely unknown (see for recent reviews <a href=\"#bib25\">Morgan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kokotos and Cousin, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">J\u00e4hne et al., 2015</a>)."

As for others small GTPases, the activity of Arf6 is tightly controlled by two families of regulatory proteins: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that function as Arf6 activators by facilitating the conversion from GDP-bound inactive form to GTP-bound active form, and GTPase activating protein (GAPs) that function as negative regulators by enhancing GTP hydrolisis. Neurons express several GEFs and GAPs for Arf6 and Arf6 has been reported to play a role in neurite outgrowth and dendritic spine maturation although its function in mature synapses is largely unknown (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jaworski, 2007</a>). At postsynaptic sites, accumulating evidence has recently shown that Arf6 plays a role in AMPA receptor trafficking and long-term synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Scholz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Myers et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Oku and Huganir, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Zheng et al., 2015</a>). At presynaptic sites, Arf6 has been predicted to play a role in the assembly of the clathrin coated complex during SV endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Krauss et al., 2003</a>). While overexpression of the Arf6 GEF msec7-1 has been reported to increase basal synaptic transmission at the <i>Xenopus</i> neuromuscular junction (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ashery et al., 1999</a>), the function of Arf6 at the presynaptic terminal has never been directly addressed. Interestingly, mutations in Arf6 regulatory genes have been recently associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy in humans (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shoubridge et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Falace et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rauch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fine et al., 2015</a>)."

We also evaluated Arf6 expression at synaptic level by immunocytochemistry. Endogenous Arf6 colocalyzed with both presynaptic (Synaptophysin) and postsynaptic (Homer1) markers in primary rat hippocampal neurons (17 days in vitro, DIV) and triple labelling showed expression of the small GTPase at the presynaptic and postsynaptic site of single synaptic puncta (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To directly examine how Arf6 activity impacts on synapse structure, we performed electron microscopy (EM) analysis at Arf6-knockdown (KD) synapses. Rat hippocampal neurons were transduced at 12 DIV, after the initial wave of synaptogenesis had occurred, with a lentiviral vector, driving the expression of short hairpin targeting the coding sequence of the rat Arf6 mRNA (shRNA#1) or the respective mismatch control and GFP as a reporter. The silencing efficiency was tested 5 days post transduction by western blotting (WB) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Ultrastructural analysis revealed that Arf6-KD synapses were undistinguishable from control synapses in terms of synaptic area and active zone (AZ) length (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), but were characterized by a decreased total number of SVs and a significantly increased number of SVs docked at the AZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Moreover, intraterminal cisternae, resembling endosome-like structures and occasionally found in control synapses, were dramatically increased in Arf6-silenced synapses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The observed phenotype was completely rescued by the expression of a rat Arf6 variant resistant to shRNA#1 silencing (Arf6-res, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

This observation rules out the possibility that the intraterminal cisternae represent membrane infoldings in continuity with the plasma membrane. To investigate on the nature of intraterminal cisternae, Arf6-silenced and control neurons were stained with the synaptic marker VAMP2 and the synaptic endosome markers Rab5 and Vti1A. At Arf6-KD VAMP2-positive synapses, a significant increase of both Rab5 and Vti1A signals was observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The increased immmunoreactivity for endosomal markers at synaptic sites together with the direct observation that cisternae that accumulate upon Arf6 silencing are detached from the plasma membrane lead us to consider them <i>bona fide</i> endosome-like organelles (Elos)."

We first tested the efficiency of SecinH3 to impair Arf6 activation in hippocampal primary cultures (17\u00a0DIV) by pull-down experiments and revealed a significant decrease of GTP-bound Arf6 in SecinH3-treated neurons with respect to control (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Wild-type neurons were therefore treated with either SecinH3 or vehicle (DMSO) and analyzed for synapse morphology.

The possibility that the SecinH3 treatment results in delocalization of Arf6 from synaptic sites was assessed by staining control and treated cultures with the presynaptic marker Synaptophysin and Arf6. No significant difference was observed in the intensity of the Arf6 signal at Synaptophysin-positive puncta in control and SecinH3-treated neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These data demonstrate that the lack of Arf6 activation, rather than of its expression, is sufficient to cause the accumulation of both SVs at the AZ and Elos at the expense of total SVs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Moreover, the acute SecinH3 treatment suggests that accumulating Elos represent transient structures rather than stable organelles recruited at the synapse upon loss of Arf6 activation."

Arf6-shRNA (or the mismatched control) together with the RFP reporter, and SypHy were transiently co-transfected in rat hippocampal neurons in order to record from a silenced neuron embedded in a network of non-silenced ones (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Considering the emerging role of Arf6 in AMPA receptor trafficking (<a href=\"#bib35\">Scholz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Myers et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Oku and Huganir, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Zheng et al., 2015</a>), this approach allows ruling out the contribution of postsynaptic effects on the observed phenotype. Experiments were performed at 17\u201318 DIV (3\u20134 days after transfection) and RFP/SypHy-positive axonal processes were selected for stimulation and analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). When the amount of surface-expressed SypHy was evaluated, we observed a significant increase of extracellularly exposed SypHy at Arf6-silenced synapses compared with control synapses, suggestive of a global impairment of SV cycling (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Neurons were first stimulated with 40 action potentials (APs) at 20\u00a0Hz, a protocol widely employed to measure the readily releasable pool (RRP) of SVs and, therefore, suitable to reveal if the increased docked SVs observed by EM were functional or represented mistargeted/unprimed SVs, not competent for fusion. Both the shRNA #1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>) and the shRNA #2 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) significantly increased the peak fluorescence at the end of the 2 s. Stimulation without affecting the kinetics of fluorescence return to basal level at the end of the stimulation, which describe \u2018post-stimulus\u2019 endocytosis. To reveal whether the increased peak fluorescence was due to higher exocytosis or impairment of \u2018during-stimulus\u2019 endocytosis we employed the H<sup>+</sup>ATPase inhibitor\u00a0Bafilomycin. This drug prevents reacidification of internalized SVs and allows monitoring net exocytosis. The peak fluorescence was equally increased when neurons were stimulated in the presence of Bafilomycin, suggesting that the observed peak fluorescence increase was indeed attributable to an increased number of exocytosed SVs. (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Next, to exclude the involvement of shRNA-mediated off-target effects, we performed rescue experiments. When hippocampal neurons were triple transfected with SypHy, Arf6 shRNA#1 and a V5-tagged Arf6 rat variant resistant to shRNA#1 silencing (Arf6-res, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) the peak fluorescence at the end of the 40APs@20Hz stimulation returned to the control level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). These data demonstrate that increased docked SVs in Arf6-depleted synapses are indeed functional releasable SVs and that Arf6 silencing causes an alteration in the process of neurotransmission in the absence of any effects on the kinetics of RRP endocytosis."

Bafilomycin was concomitantly used to dissect out \u2018during-stimulus\u2019 recycling. At control synapses, Bafilomycin increased the response to the stimulation, indicative of the existence of an active \u2018during-stimulus\u2019 recycling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). At the end of the stimulation, and in the absence of Bafilomycin, fluorescence returned to the basal level due to \u2018post-stimulus\u2019 endocytosis, with an average time constant of endocytosis (\u03c4) of 36 s. Strikingly, at Arf6-KD synapses, the peak fluorescence was not modified by Bafilomycin, suggesting a strong impairment of \u2018during-stimulus\u2019\u00a0endocytosis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To measure the net exocytosis (EXO) during stimulation, the areas below the curves in the presence of Bafilomycin were calculated and no differences were observed between control and Arf6 KD synapses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). To quantify net \u2018during-stimulus\u2019 endocytosis (ENDO), additional curves were obtained by plotting the point-by-point differences between the curves run in the presence and absence of Bafilomycin. The time course of \u2018during- stimulus\u2019 endocytosis revealed that recycling was virtually absent in the first 12 s of stimulation, and started to take place only in the last 8 s of stimulation, resulting in a significant decrease in ENDO upon Arf6 silencing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Moreover, Arf6 silencing slowed down also \u2018post-stimulus\u2019 endocytosis as revealed by the significantly higher \u03c4 (59 s, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), suggesting an involvement of the small GTPase in the endocytosis of recycling SVs, differently from what has been observed for SVs belonging to the RRP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Remarkably, all the described defects on \u2018during-stimulus\u2019 and \u2018post-stimulus\u2019 recycling in Arf6-KD synapses were completely rescued by the concomitant expression of the shRNA#1-resistant Arf6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>).

To challenge these hypotheses, we visualized SVs and intraterminal cisternae formation upon AP firing by stimulating control or Arf6-KD neurons (17\u201318 DIV) in the presence of soluble HRP. Samples were fixed at the end of the stimulation (400APs@20Hz) and after 2 and 20\u00a0min. wash in the absence of HRP. The decreased number of SVs and the increased number of docked SVs and intraterminal cisternae were fully confirmed in Arf6 deficient synapses at all time point (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, when the HRP-positive (HRP<sup>+</sup>) structures at the end of the stimulus, representative of active cycling during stimulation, were analyzed, a significant decrease HRP<sup>+</sup> SVs accompanied by an increase of HRP<sup>+</sup> cisternae in Arf6-KD terminals compared to control was observed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This result correlates with the observed defect in \u2018during-stimulus\u2019 endocytosis revealed by the SypHy experiments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and suggests that Elos preferentially form when Arf6 signalling is occluded. Interestingly, after 2\u00a0min. wash in the absence of HRP, HRP<sup>+</sup> SVs remained substantially unchanged in control synapses, while they significantly increased in Arf6-depleted terminals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This increase demonstrates that, in Arf6-depleted terminals, SVs efficiently form from intermediate endosomal structures, since the additional HRP<sup>+</sup>SVs can only derive from intraterminal HRP<sup>+</sup>-Elos after HRP had been removed from the extracellular medium. The data suggest that Arf6 regulates the direct formation and recycling of SVs so that, in its absence, Elos form upon stimulation and SVs lately bud from the newly formed structures. Finally, after 20\u00a0min-wash in the absence of HRP, SVs and intraterminal cisternae significantly lose their HRP content in both experimental groups, suggesting that both SVs and cisternae are actively recycled, thus\u00a0ruling out the possibility that SVs are stuck at Elos in Arf6-depleted synapses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

Considering that the molecular nature, as well as the function of synaptic endosomal structures is a matter of debate, our 3D analysis coupled with staining for endosomal markers demonstrate that the structures that form upon Arf6-silencing are <i>bona fide</i> synaptic Elos. Moreover, these organelles unequivocally participate in SV recycling as their formation is abrogated by TTX treatment. The same phenotype is observed when blocking Arf6 activation by pharmacological treatment, demonstrating that synaptic Elos form due to the loss of Arf6 activation, that results therefore essential for the direct recycling of endocytosed SV. The increased travelling of SVs via synaptic Elos at Arf6-depleted synapses, results in recycling defects during long-lasting stimulation (20 s), when multiple rounds of exo-endocytosis are required, suggesting that direct, rather than endosomal, recycling is the favorite and most efficient recycling route during repetitive stimulation. Moreover, synaptic Elos formation is accompanied by an increased RRP demonstrating that, while defining the recycling route of endocytosed SV, Arf6 also regulates the abundance of release competent SVs at the AZ."

                        "text": "The function of endosomal structures at the synaptic terminal is still elusive, but a role in both regeneration of SVs and SV protein sorting and renewal has been described (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hoopmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wucherpfennig et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fernandes et al., 2014</a>). Our data reveal that the small GTPase Arf6 is a component of the machinery that regulates the fate of an endocytosed SV at the synapse. We speculate that active Arf6 shifts SVs toward direct recycling, away from synaptic Elos, through which only a subset of SVs, either devoid of Arf6 or in which Arf6 is inactive, travel to undergo protein turnover. This scenario is reminiscent of the role of active Arf6 in endosomal recycling of transferrin receptors, where the small GTPase mediates fast recycling of the receptor, and confirms the central role of Arf6 in determining the intracellular trafficking pathway of endocytic cargoes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Montagnac et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Grant and Donaldson, 2009</a>).\u00a0Intriguingly, upstream regulators of Arf6 activity have been recently demonstrated to act in SV recycling at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction with morphological and functional phenotypes reminiscent of the Arf6-depleted hippocampal synapses described in this paper (<a href=\"#bib39\">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Podufall et al., 2014</a>). Several downstream effectors for active GTP-bound Arf6 have been described that could play a role in SV recycling at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib8\">Donaldson and Jackson, 2011</a>), and among them the adaptor protein AP-2 is of particular relevance (<a href=\"#bib29\">Paleotti et al., 2005</a>). Neuron-specific deletion of AP-2 has been recently described to result in the accumulation of presynaptic endosome-like vacuoles and loss of SVs at hippocampal synapses (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kononenko et al., 2014</a>), resembling the Arf6-KD phenotype described here. Accumulation of synaptic endosomal structures can be attributed to defective SVs reformation or to an increase in the trafficking of SVs via intermediate endosomal compartments because of a defect in the direct recycling route bypassing intermediate endosomes. For Arf6-KD neurons, we favor the second hypothesis as morpho-functional experiments revealed that Arf6-depleted synapses show deficient SV formation upon stimulation but functional SV reformation from intraterminal Elos during the post-stimulus period. Endosome-like structures seem therefore to preferentially form at the expense of SVs in the absence of Arf6, which instead does not appear to play a major role on SV reformation from Elos."

Indeed, RRP is increased at Arf6-depleted synapses but the kinetics of endocytosis for the SVs belonging to RRP was unaffected, supporting the idea that endosomal recycling is the retrieval mechanisms selected by SVs from the RRP. In line with these observations, clathrin depletion was recently reported to be ineffective on endocytotic decay after RRP depletion (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kononenko et al., 2014</a>), suggesting a clathrin/Arf6-independent SV retrieval for RRP vesicles. However, the increased RRP due to Arf6 silencing was insensitive to TTX, opening the possibility that it is a distinct activity-independent mechanism. Differently from what we observed after the short (2 s) stimulation, Arf6 depletion impacts on SV endocytosis after the longer (20\u00a0s) stimulation, suggesting that not only the frequency, but also the duration of the stimulus can challenge the membrane retrieval mechanisms."

Interestingly, Rab proteins can act both as regulators or effectors for activated Arf6, as demonstrated in various cellular systems (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chesneau et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Shi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pellet\u00e1n et al., 2015</a>).

Structures with sagittal diameter comprised between 20 and 80 nm were classified as SVs, while those with a sagittal diameter bigger than 80nm were classified as intra-terminal cisternae. SVs touching AZ were classified as docked SVs."

For electrical field stimulation, coverslips were mounted into the imaging chamber (~100 \u03bcl volume; Quick Exchange Platform; Warner Instruments) and APs were evoked by passing 1 msec current pulses through platinum iridium electrodes using an AM2100 stimulator (AM-Systems). After 10\u00a0s of baseline acquisition (<i>F</i>0), neurons were stimulated with a train of 40/400 APs at 20Hz in the presence or absence of 1 \u03bcM Bafilomycin. At the end of the stimulation protocol, cells were perfused with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<i>F</i><sub>max</sub>). Images were analyzed using the eXcellence software (Olympus).

The time constant of endocytosis (\u03c4 endo) was calculated by the fitting the post-stimulus decay with a single-exponential function. To quantify net exocytosis (EXO) ongoing during stimulation, the areas below the curves obtained in the presence of Bafilomycin were measured. To quantify the net during stimulus\u2019 endocytosis (ENDO), additional curves were built from the differences between the curves run in the presence and those in the absence of Bafilomycin and the areas below the curves were measured."

It is evident that these objects do participate in synaptic recycling. This can be inferred from the fact that they disappear upon TTX treatment, and also from the results in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, which follow closely the original Heuser &amp; Reese, 1973, experiments on this subject. The simplest interpretation of the manuscript, therefore, is that Arf6 is involved in the break-up of such organelles in synaptic vesicles. In a knock-down of Arf6 the efficiency of this break-up process is far lower, and the endosome-like organelles become prominent, since their break-up is slowed down. Other effects, such as the persistence of the readily recycling pool, point to a lower involvement of endosome-like organelles in this pool, something that has been suggested before, as the authors also acknowledge."

As shown by the representative images and related intensity profiles (panel A of new <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) Arf6 signal colocalized with both markers. Considering the resolution of conventional optical microscopy this evidence is only suggestive for expression at both pre- and post-synaptic compartments. We therefore performed immunocytochemistry with Arf6, the presynaptic marker VGlut1 and the postsynaptic marker Homer1. We used VGlut1 because an antibody raised in guinea pig anti-VGLut1 is commercially available (Synaptic Systems, #135 304, 1:200) allowing to perform triple immunolabelling. We analysed the intensity profiles of the Arf6 signal at single synaptic puncta in which pre- and post-synaptic signals were not completely overlapped. We revealed that indeed Ar6 signal is present at both pre- and post-synaptic compartments (panel B of new <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This evidence is supported by biochemical fractionation of isolated nerve terminals in which Arf6 immunoreactivity is mainly associated with intra-synaptic protein, as the SV-marker Synaptophysin, and scarcely associated with both presynaptic- (active zone) and post-synaptic (postsynaptic density) membranes (panel C of new <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is therefore expected that, as correctly observed in the revision, disruption of Arf6 may also alter endosomal markers at the postsynaptic level."

The highlight \"Arf6 switch channeling SVs to direct rather than to endosomal recycling\" was therefore not related to results in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> but rather to the results shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, in which a different protocol of stimulation (400 action potentials at 20Hz) has been used. This protocol allows measurable recycling that was indeed significantly decreased in the absence of Arf6.

The simplest interpretation of the manuscript, therefore, is that Arf6 is involved in the break-up of such organelles in synaptic vesicles. In a knock-down of Arf6 the efficiency of this break-up process is far lower, and the endosome-like organelles become prominent, since their break-up is slowed down. Other effects, such as the persistence of the readily recycling pool, point to a lower involvement of endosome-like organelles in this pool, something that has been suggested before, as the authors also acknowledge.</i> "

To validate this hypothesis we performed morpho-functional experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, in which the ultrastructural analysis was coupled with the evaluation of SV and organelle recycling upon stimulation. The data suggest that endosome-like organelles preferentially form at the expense of SVs upon Arf6 depletion. Indeed, the increased endosome-like structures upon stimulation (400 action potentials at 20Hz) at Arf6-depleted synapses is followed by formation of HRP-positive SVs, as shown in the quantification after 2 min. of washing, which most probably derive from HRP-positive endosome-like organelles. Moreover after longer washing (20 min) HRP-positive-SVs and HRP-positive endosome-like structures equally decreased in both control and Arf6-depleted synapses. These data therefore suggested a preferential accumulation rather than an increased persistence of endosomal-like organelles at Arf6 depleted synapses."
