Surprisingly, PPP1R15-PP1 binary complexes reconstituted in vitro lacked substrate selectivity. However, selectivity was restored by crude cell lysate or purified G-actin, which joined PPP1R15-PP1 to form a stable ternary complex. In crystal structures of the non-selective PPP1R15B-PP1G complex, the functional core of PPP1R15 made multiple surface contacts with PP1G, but at a distance from the active site, whereas in the substrate-selective ternary complex, actin contributes to one face of a platform encompassing the active site. Computational docking of the N-terminal lobe of eIF2a at this platform placed phosphorylated serine 51 near the active site. Mutagenesis of predicted surface-contacting residues enfeebled dephosphorylation, suggesting that avidity for the substrate plays an important role in imparting specificity on the PPP1R15B-PP1G-actin ternary complex."

Surprisingly, PPP1R15-PP1 binary complexes reconstituted in vitro lacked substrate selectivity. However, selectivity was restored by crude cell lysate or purified G-actin, which joined PPP1R15-PP1 to form a stable ternary complex. In crystal structures of the non-selective PPP1R15B-PP1G complex, the functional core of PPP1R15 made multiple surface contacts with PP1G, but at a distance from the active site, whereas in the substrate-selective ternary complex, actin contributes to one face of a platform encompassing the active site. Computational docking of the N-terminal lobe of eIF2a at this platform placed phosphorylated serine 51 near the active site. Mutagenesis of predicted surface-contacting residues enfeebled dephosphorylation, suggesting that avidity for the substrate plays an important role in imparting specificity on the PPP1R15B-PP1G-actin ternary complex."

This suggests that in cells this enzyme contains an additional unknown subunit. Now, Chen et al.

Chen et al. then used a combination of biochemical and structural biology techniques to investigate the phosphatase activity of the three-subunit complex. These findings suggest a plausible molecular mechanism by which the three-subunit complex becomes selective for its target, but further refinements to the structural work will be needed to critically test these suggestions."

Phosphorylated eIF2 inhibits its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, attenuating the translation of most mRNA, whilst the translation of a small subset of mRNAs, with special 5\u2032 untranslated regions, is increased (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hinnebusch, 2005</a>). As the latter encode potent transcription factors, such as GCN4 in yeasts and ATF4 in animals, eIF2a phosphorylation activates gene expression programs with broad physiological ramifications: the integrated stress response (ISR) in mammals and its yeast counterpart, the general control response (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harding et al., 2003</a>)."

Importantly, inactivation of both PPP1R15 isoforms is lethal to cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tsaytler et al., 2011</a>), but can be rescued by converting serine 51 of eIF2a to the non-phosphorylatable alanine, providing genetic proof for the narrow in vivo substrate specificity of the PPP1R15 family of regulatory subunits (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harding et al., 2009</a>)."

This is also the only sequence in eIF2a-specific regulatory subunits that is conserved broadly across phyla and is encoded by a separate exon; a conserved feature of the genomic organization of the two isoforms of <i>PPP1R15</i>. Viruses have co-opted PPP1R15; presumably to neutralize the effects of host PKR (<a href=\"#bib20\">He et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">1997</a>) and conservation amongst these viral proteins is also confined to the same stretch of 70 residues. The preeminence of the PPP1R15 C-terminus is also supported by functional experiments, as over-expression of this portion was the basis of their identification as ISR inhibitors in the first place (<a href=\"#bib43\">Novoa et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jousse et al., 2003</a>), whereas the extended N-terminal region of PPP1R15 participates in membrane binding, regulating subcellular localization and turnover (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brush et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brush and Shenolikar, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>)."

PPP1R15B followed a trajectory along the surface of PP1G similar to that traced by the regulatory subunits spinophilin (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ragusa et al., 2010</a>) and PNUTS/PPP1R10 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Choy et al., 2014</a>). As expected, the side chains of V<sup>641</sup> and F<sup>643</sup> (of the <span class=\"small-caps\">RVxF</span> motif) engage hydrophobic crevices on the backside of the catalytic subunit, an interaction common to PP1 regulatory subunits (<a href=\"#bib14\">Egloff et al., 1997</a>).

Along this path PPP1R15B Y<sup>650</sup> occupies a position similar to spinophilin F<sup>459</sup> and PNUTS F<sup>411</sup> whereas PPP1R15B I<sup>652</sup> occupies a position similar to spinophilin T<sup>461</sup> and PNUTS F<sup>413</sup>, whose side chains engage the \u03d5\u03d5 motif binding-site of PP1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Choy et al., 2014</a>). The side chain of PPP1R15B R<sup>658</sup> engages a deep pocket on the PP1 surface, occupying the same position as spinophilin R<sup>469</sup> and PNUTS R<sup>420</sup> and forming a conserved salt bridge with PP1G D<sup>71</sup> in the \u2018Arg site\u2019, as predicted by Choy and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib8\">Choy et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The interactions between PPP1R15B and PP1G were thus confined to residues conserved in all PP1 isoforms, explaining the lack of preference of PPP1R15 for binding different PP1 isoforms."

Previous structures of PP1 revealed two metal ions, M1 and M2 (likely Mn<sup>2+</sup>) in the shallow groove implicated in catalysis. Two metal ions were also detected in the complex of PP1G 7\u2013300 with PPP1R15B 631\u2013669 (PDB: 4V0W), occupying the sites observed in other crystal forms of PP1 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). However, in the crystal structure of the binary complex of PP1G with the shorter, PPP1R15B 631\u2013660 (PDB: 4V0V), and the longer PPP1R15B 631\u2013684 (PDB: 4V0X), only a single metal ion, occupying an identical M2 position, was observed (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). An unoccupied M1 site was previously observed in the crystal structure of PP1G-Inhibitor-2 complex (PDB: 2O8G) and the okadaic acid-bound PP1G (PDB: 1JK7), suggesting that the metal ion at M1 site is more labile than that at the M2 site and that the structures determined here provide different snapshots of metal ion occupancy of the catalytic subunit."

Our estimate of 1.13 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b5M eIF2a in the cytosol of HEK 293T cells agrees well with an estimate derived from the number of molecules of the yeast homolog, Sui2p, in a haploid yeast cells (1.71 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> molecules/cell, [<a href=\"#bib16\">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</a>], which, assuming a yeast cell volume of 60 fl, of which half is cytosol, yields a concentration of 0.95 \u00b5M). This information enabled a detailed quantitative comparison of the initial velocity of eIF2a<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation over a range of physiologically relevant substrate concentrations by three different purified enzymes: apo-PP1G, a binary complex of PPP1R15B-PP1G and a ternary complex of actin-PPP1R15B-PP1G.

Whilst the resolution of the ternary complex is insufficient to trace the regulatory subunit's trajectory beyond that defined by the higher resolution binary complexes (i.e., C-terminal to W<sup>662</sup>), the most significant feature in the averaged difference density map is observed in the cleft between domains I and III in actin's barbed end (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>); suggesting that PPP1R15B extends to engage this site and providing a plausible explanation for the inhibitory effect of cytochalasin D on eIF2a<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation by the ternary complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

In so doing it follows closely the path of other regulatory subunits, spinophilin (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ragusa et al., 2010</a>) and PNUTS (<a href=\"#bib8\">Choy et al., 2014</a>). However, these well-resolved interactions (involving residues R<sup>639</sup>-W<sup>662</sup>) account for slightly less than half the length of the PPP1R15B functional core. Residues C-terminal to W<sup>662</sup>, which are not conserved in other regulatory subunits, are also not resolved in crystal structures of the PPP1R15B-PP1G binary complex. Furthermore, binary complexes containing the entire functional core of PPP1R15B require the presence of actin for stability and solubility. Unfortunately, the resolution of the ternary complex is too low to place the portion of PPP1R15B C-terminal of W<sup>662</sup> in the density maps, but mutagenesis suggests that it plays an important role in actin-mediated substrate-specific dephosphorylation."

Furthermore, the presence of density in the cleft between actin domains I and III, which is known to accommodate a short amphipathic helix of other G-actin binding partners (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</a>), is consistent with the engagement of the C-terminal five residues of the functional core of PPP1R15. Deletion of this predicted short amphipathic helical region of PPP1R15 markedly impairs activation by actin in vitro and de-stabilizes actin's association with PPP1R15 in vivo (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chambers et al., 2015</a>). Together, the in vivo and in vitro approaches suggest two complementary roles for actin: stabilizing the PPP1R15-PP1 complex and endowing it with substrate specificity. The two functions can be separated in vitro by mutations that retain sufficient PP1 binding to enable reliable measurement of the non-specific phosphatase activity of the binary PPP1R15-PP1 complex and all but eliminate actin's ability to promote substrate specificity."

This model of the enzyme-bound substrate identifies surface residues in PP1 and actin that could engage the substrate in ionic interactions. In support of this model, we note that mutations in several of these residues enfeeble dephosphorylation of eIF2a<sup>P</sup> by the specific ternary complex, but less so by the binary complex. This feature is noted not only for the eIF2a R<sup>74</sup>E mutation, predicted to affect the binding to actin, but also in mutations affecting residues predicted to interact with charged surface residues of PP1 (eIF2a residues R<sup>66</sup>E and K<sup>86</sup>E), suggesting that such substrate-PP1 contacts are especially important in the setting of the actin-containing ternary complex.

The enfeebling effect of actin is modest by comparison to its stimulatory effect on dephosphorylation of the specific substrate, eIF2a<sup>P</sup>. This last observation is consistent with the shallowness of the composite surface, which would likely have a modest negative effect on accessibility of a structured substrate to the active site and even less so to inhibit an unstructured phosphorylated peptide (such as GST<sup>P</sup>). However, as bacterially-expressed PP1 has more promiscuous phosphatase activity than the enzyme purified from natural sources (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alessi et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">MacKintosh et al., 1996</a>), we may be underestimating the extent to which G-actin biases against the dephosphorylation of other PP1 substrates, such as phosphorylase A. These considerations may also account for the apparent difference in the extent of the bias against phosphorylase A noted in this study and an earlier one which used PP1 derived from rabbit muscle (<a href=\"#bib9\">Connor et al., 2001</a>). The functional importance of an inhibitory facet of regulatory subunit action is influenced by stoichiometric considerations. As the pool of free PP1 in cells is believed to be low, the dramatic increase in PPP1R15A levels in stressed cells may have consequences not only in terms of enhanced dephosphorylation of eIF2a<sup>P</sup> but also in terms of diminished dephosphorylation of other substrates."

The ternary complex was refined with Refmac5 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Murshudov et al., 2011</a>); to cope with the low resolution of the data, the refinement used jelly-body and NCS restraints, TLS parameterisation to describe thermal motion, and the actin structure in PDB: 1IJJ was used as an external reference model. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are reported in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. Ribbon, surface and density map representations were prepared in the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Version 1.5.0.4, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC)."

Chains B, F, and G of PDB: 4V0U were used as inputs for the ternary complex and the N-terminal lobe of yeast eIF2a (chain A of PDB: 1Q46) as the input for the substrate. Distance restrains between phosphoserine 51 of yeast eIF2a N-terminal domain and Asn124, His125, Asp208, and the two metal ions in the active site of PP1G from the ternary complex were applied."

Like PP1-MYPT1, PP1-spinophilin and others, the interaction of the PP1 binding protein blocks dephosphorylation of substrates (typically phosphorylase is used), but allows either unaltered dephosphorylation of other substrates (e.g. PP1-spinophilin towards GluR1) or enhanced dephosphorylation of a specific target (e.g. PP1-MYPT toward myosin light chain). In the case of R15 early studies (e.g. <a href=\"#bib9\">Connor et al., 2001</a>) showed that the activity of PP1 towards phosphorylase was blocked by GADD34, but activity towards eIF2\u03b1 was maintained. Therefore the basic experimental set-up used does not address the selective blockade of non-preferred substrates; this is an important omission (our emphasis). The assessment of PP1 activity is also made more complicated by the known limitation that bacterial PP1 (generated in a Mn<sup>2+</sup> form) possesses promiscuous activity that is not found for native enzyme. Thus the assay used here measures an activity which is not designed to address the question of what is driving preference for eIF2\u03b1 (our emphasis). Indeed, an interpretation of the key data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> is that addition of the cell lysate blocks the non-specific activity towards phospho-GST, not that it confers any change in eIF2\u03b1 activity, though much more quantitative kinetic analysis is required to know exactly what is going on. On this point, the other reviewer also wondered why addition of lysate alone did not dephosphorylate the non-specific substrate, when there are many different phosphatases in cell lysates."
