                    "text": "Somitogenesis is regulated by a molecular oscillator that drives dynamic gene expression within the pre-somitic mesoderm. Previous mathematical models of the somitogenesis clock that invoke the mechanism of delayed negative feedback predict that its oscillation period depends on the sum of delays inherent to negative-feedback loops and inhibitor half-lives. We develop a mathematical model that explores the possibility that positive feedback also plays a role in determining the period of clock oscillations. The model predicts that increasing the half-life of the positive regulator, Notch intracellular domain (NICD), can lead to elevated NICD levels and an increase in the oscillation period. To test this hypothesis, we investigate a phenotype induced by various small molecule inhibitors in which the clock is slowed. We observe elevated levels and a prolonged half-life of NICD. Reducing NICD production rescues these effects. These data provide the first indication that tight control of the turnover of positive as well as negative regulators of the clock determines its periodicity."

Previous mathematical models of the somitogenesis clock that invoke the mechanism of delayed negative feedback predict that its oscillation period depends on the sum of delays inherent to negative-feedback loops and inhibitor half-lives. We develop a mathematical model that explores the possibility that positive feedback also plays a role in determining the period of clock oscillations. The model predicts that increasing the half-life of the positive regulator, Notch intracellular domain (NICD), can lead to elevated NICD levels and an increase in the oscillation period. To test this hypothesis, we investigate a phenotype induced by various small molecule inhibitors in which the clock is slowed. We observe elevated levels and a prolonged half-life of NICD. Reducing NICD production rescues these effects. These data provide the first indication that tight control of the turnover of positive as well as negative regulators of the clock determines its periodicity."

Some aspects of this process are well understood. Firstly, many \u2018clock genes\u2019 are known to produce proteins that can inhibit their own production. However, this \u2018negative feedback\u2019 is typically delayed because it takes time to produce and transport protein within a cell. The inhibitory proteins are also unstable and their breakdown leads to an end of their inhibitiory effect. It is also known that: some proteins send signals to neighbouring cells while others, including one called Notch, receive them; and the received signals activate the expression of clock genes. However, until now, no one had studied how the turnover (that is, the production and breakdown) of the proteins that activate clock gene expression could regulate the pace of the clock."

First, they developed a computational model that accounted for both inhibition and activation of clock gene expression. The model predicts that the clock slows down when the levels of a positive regulator called Notch intracellular domain (or NICD for short) are high. This is because the negative regulators would have to overcome the increased positive regulators to switch off the clock genes. A slower segmentation clock would be expected to give rise to fewer, larger somites in a given length of time when compared to a similar clock with a faster pace."

The experiments agreed with the model predictions. That is, when treated with a variety of drugs that affected NICD turnover and thereby increased the levels of NICD, the clock slowed and these chicken embryos developed fewer, but larger somites. As predicted by the mathematical model, these effects were rescued when Wiedermann, Bone et al. reduced the production of NICD. These findings show that a balance of positive and negative regulators determines the pace of the segmentation clock."

Segmentation is progressive and occurs in an anterior to posterior direction as the body axis elongates (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib52\">Oates et al., 2012</a>). Mesodermal segments, or somites, \u2018pinch off\u2019 at the rostral limit of the two rods of pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) that lie on either side of the caudal neural tube, with a distinct, species-specific periodicity; every 90 min in the chicken and every 120 min in the mouse. This periodicity is regulated by a molecular oscillator, known as the segmentation clock, that is defined by cyclic gene expression within PSM tissue with a period that regulates somite formation. These \u2018clock\u2019 genes belong to the Notch, WNT and FGF signalling pathways and are expressed in a cyclical pattern in the PSM of a wide variety of vertebrate species (<a href=\"#bib39\">Krol et al., 2011</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib13\">Dequ\u00e9ant et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gibb et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Maroto et al., 2012</a>).

Moreover, in zebrafish there is experimental evidence that Notch plays a key role in the synchronisation of neighbouring oscillators (<a href=\"#bib12\">Delaune et al., 2012</a>) but that it is not necessary for oscillations themselves (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ozbudak and Lewis, 2008</a>). In contrast, Notch signalling in mouse and chick is thought to be essential for oscillations (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ferjentsik et al., 2009</a>). One crucial factor in this regard is the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) which is cleaved following ligand activation, translocates to the nucleus and activates Notch target gene expression. NICD is unstable and, at least in mouse, its production appears as pulsatile, spatio-temporal waves that traverse the rostro-caudal axis of the PSM in the manner of a clock gene (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huppert et al., 2005</a>). Importantly, pulsatile Notch1 protein expression was recently shown to be dependent on Notch signalling in the PSM of both chick and mouse (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bone et al., 2014</a>); this raises the possibility that, in mouse and chick at least, positive feedback, mediated by Notch and NICD, plays a role in the clock mechanism."

The model predicts that increasing the half-life of NICD results in elevated levels of NICD and a longer clock period. Notably, these effects are not observed in the model upon increasing the half-life of the repressing clock protein. To test the predictions, we use a pharmacological approach that robustly delays the phase patterns of a clock gene in the chick and mouse PSM. Under these conditions, using a custom made antibody that recognises endogenous chick NICD, we show that, concomitant to delaying the pace of oscillations, the inhibitors increase both levels of NICD and its half-life. In agreement with model predictions, we rescue the phase patterns of clock gene expression by reducing NICD production. These data therefore suggest that increasing the half-life of NICD and thus increasing its turnover time increases the period of the somitogenesis clock."

These numerical solutions demonstrate that, in the model, the balance between NICD production and degradation rates plays a key role in determining the clock period. Additionally, we note that there is a critical value of the production rate below which the trivial steady-state becomes stable (solutions tend to zero) and that perturbing clock protein and NICD production and decay rates can drive the system into stable states (e.g., by increasing repressor half-life in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> or reducing the NICD production rate in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>)."

To experimentally test the predictions of our model, we used a half-embryo assay to investigate whether levels and half-life of NICD were elevated under conditions where clock gene oscillations were robustly delayed using a pharmacological approach (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gibb et al., 2009</a>). In the first instance, PSM explants from chick embryos between Hamburger Hamilton (HH) stages 10\u201312 were exposed to XAV939, a specific Wnt inhibitor that acts by inhibiting Tankyrase1 (TNK1) and TNK2 enzymes, which normally degrade Axin2. Hence upon treatment with XAV939, AXIN2 protein is stabilised and maintains phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin protein in the destruction complex (<a href=\"#bib32\">Huang et al., 2009</a>)."

Using the same assay, we investigated the effect of the inhibitor on the dynamic expression of <i>cLfng</i> in the PSM<i>.</i> Following exposure to 100 \u03bcM XAV939, the domain of <i>cLfng</i> expression was at least 1 phase behind that of the control explant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, M; n = 57/64) and occasionally this resulted in the treated explant forming one less somite boundary than the control explant. These data imply that 100 \u03bcM XAV939 treatment noticeably lengthens the period of the oscillations. In explant pairs where both sides were DMSO-treated, an asymmetric pattern of <i>cLfng</i> expression was rarely seen (n = 2/18, data not shown) and, as such, the effects of XAV939 on <i>cLfng</i> expression could not be attributed to DMSO, natural variability in expression, or to the assay itself. In order to ensure that the oscillations were delayed and not halted, a fix and culture assay (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) revealed that <i>cLfng</i> expression was still dynamic in the presence of 100 \u03bcM XAV939 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; n = 8/9). Furthermore, Phospho-histone H3 (pH3) and NucView analyses demonstrated that neither proliferation nor apoptosis, respectively, were significantly affected following drug treatment (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,D</a>; n = 4, p = 0.236; n = 4, p = 0.292). These data clearly demonstrate that Wnt inhibition delays the period of the segmentation clock in the chick PSM. Using the same half-embryo inhibitor assay in the mouse embryo, we found that exposure to 100 \u03bcM XAV939 delayed the pace of <i>mLfng</i> oscillations as compared to control DMSO-treated E10.5 half PSM explants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>; n = 19/26).

To that end we generated a polyclonal anti-cNICD antibody raised against the chicken N-terminal sequence of the cleaved chicken Notch1 intracellular domain. The epitope is only exposed after gamma secretase cleavage and is not accessible in the un-cleaved form. After confirming specificity by Western Blotting against recombinant cNICD protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, lanes 1, 2), we cultured half-PSM explant pairs in the presence of the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor LY411575 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lanz et al., 2004</a>) or DMSO for 3 hr. Western Blot revealed a specific band against endogenous cNICD that ran at the same size as recombinant cNICD protein and at the predicted molecular weight of \u223c87 kDa in the DMSO control pool which was abolished in the +LY411575 treated pool, thereby validating the specificity of the antibody (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, lanes 3, 4; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, lanes 1, 2). We performed immunohistochemistry on sagittal sections of chick PSM tissue to analyse the spatial localisation profile of NICD in this tissue and found it to exhibit a very similar profile to that described for mNICD in the mouse PSM (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huppert et al., 2005</a>). Thus cNICD is produced in (and cleared from) discrete domains of the PSM in a manner reminiscent of the expression profile of clock genes in different phases of the cycle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

For each reagent, one pool was cultured for 3 hr in DMSO and the other was cultured in the inhibitor. In order to cease production of new NICD, both control and inhibitor treated pools were cultured for an additional hour in the presence of cycloheximide (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Lysates were then analysed by Western Blot for NICD. Strikingly, we observed that the level of cNICD protein was increased significantly in the presence of XAV939 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, lanes 5, 6; n = 7/9; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) compared to the corresponding DMSO control pool where the resident cNICD had degraded substantially in the presence of cycloheximide. For each assay, additional control explants confirmed that: i) <i>Lfng</i> was delayed in inhibitor treated explants; and ii) samples cultured for 3 hr in the absence of inhibitor and then for the last hour in cycloheximide alone showed a reduction in levels of NICD when compared to contralateral explants cultured in Ethanol for the last hour (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, lanes 3, 4). Notably, even in the absence of cycloheximide (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), levels of cNICD in the chicken PSM were consistently higher when treated with XAV939 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; n = 5/5; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) compared to respective DMSO control lysates, although the mean fold-change increase was slightly less. These assays reveal that exposure to XAV939 elevates the level of cNICD protein in the chicken PSM, just as it delays oscillations of the Notch target gene <i>cLfng</i>. Significantly, exposure to Cyclopamine did not affect the levels of cNICD in treated PSM explants just as it did not affect the pace of <i>cLfng</i> oscillations in this tissue (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, lanes 13, 14; n = 2/2; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

Thus, if XAV939, Roscovitine or DRB increased the production of DLL1 or Notch1, the observed increase in NICD might be secondary to increased signalling, rather than a result of changes in protein turnover. To address this possibility, we replaced the 1h CHX treatment with a 1h LY411575 treatment to specifically block production of new NICD, repeated the assay and measured levels of cNICD by Western Blot analysis. Thus, one pool of PSMs was cultured for 3 hr in DMSO and the contralateral halves were cultured in XAV939, Roscovitine or DRB. Both pools were then cultured for an hour in the presence of LY411575 before Western Blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>).

We tested whether turnover of NICD within the PSM affects the clock pace by repeating the half-embryo assay in the presence or absence of MLN4924 which inactivates SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes by suppressing neddylation of Cullin-1 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Soucy et al., 2009</a>). As a control, we analysed levels of phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin which is also targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. As expected, exposure of PSM explants to 1 \u03bcM MLN4924 led to increased levels of phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Notably, exposure of PSM explants to 1 \u03bcM MLN4924 caused a delay in the pace of <i>Lfng</i> dynamic expression across the PSM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; n = 16) and increased levels of cNICD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>; n = 3; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The fix and culture assay confirmed that <i>cLfng</i> expression was still oscillatory in the PSM at this concentration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; n = 16). Exposure to higher concentrations of MLN4924 (10\u2013100 \u03bcM) resulted in progressively greater increases in the level of cNICD but abolished dynamic <i>Lfng</i> expression across the PSM (data not shown). Notably, the mathematical model predicts that oscillations are only supported within a limited range of NICD (and Hes7) half-lives (See <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

These models are an excellent example of how a relatively simple mathematical framework can provide insight into the behaviour of a multi-component, multi-scale, nonlinear biological system. An elegant prediction of the models is that the period of the somitogenesis clock can be approximated as a sum of the constituent delays and the half-lives of negative regulators. However, whilst numerous studies have shown that genetic modification of clock components can modify the clock period, relatively little work has been published on whether half-lives of clock proteins have the predicted effect. Moreover, the models neglect the potential role of positive regulators of clock gene expression. In this study we combine experimental manipulation and mathematical modelling to begin to explore these issues."

In the model, NICD and the inhibitory clock protein compete to activate and repress the transcription of a clock gene, respectively. Notably, the release of NICD is a multi-cellular phenomenon involving the periodic and coordinated expression of cell surface proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bone et al., 2014</a>). In order to avoid describing each of the constituent components, here we consider a model of a single cell oscillator and assume that NICD is released periodically in a manner that is coupled to the transcription of other clock genes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bone et al., 2014</a>). This formalism allows us to avoid explicitly modelling the temporal dynamics of Delta and Notch across cell populations and focus solely on investigating the role of the half-life of the positive regulator. The predicted outcome of the model is that increasing the half-life of NICD elevates levels of NICD and lengthens the period of oscillations in addition to increasing levels of the inhibitory clock protein. These effects can be rescued by decreasing the production rate of NICD."

We find that for each of the small molecule inhibitor treatments, the levels of the positive regulator, NICD, are elevated and NICD half-life is increased. When interpreted within the framework of the proposed model, these data support the hypothesis that treatment with the small molecule inhibitors results in an increased half-life of the positive regulator NICD, which elevates the levels of NICD, delays the clock, and results in the formation of fewer larger somites. In contrast, when interpreted within the framework of the proposed model, the data do not support the hypothesis, for instance: that the drug treatments solely modify the half-lives of negative regulators of the somitogenesis clock, such as Hes7. We also demonstrate experimentally, in agreement with model predictions, that both the delay in the pace of <i>Lfng</i> oscillations across the PSM and the elevated levels of the positive regulator, NICD, resulting from exposure to the small molecule treatments can be rescued by decreasing NICD production."

In this study, we clearly show that, in our hands, inhibiting the Shh pathway does not affect clock pace or the level of cNICD in the chick PSM within the timeframe of our assay. A possible reason for this discrepancy with Resende et al. is that we culture explant pairs for 3 hr whereas they observed delays to somite formation, in the absence of Shh signalling, only after 7.5 hr culture and alterations to clock gene expression after 4.5 hr culture. One possible explanation for the later arising effects they observe on the pace of the clock and somite formation is that they that are indirect secondary effects arising from Shh inhibition. In contrast, we report Wnt inhibition, within a 3 hr time frame, elicited by exposure to XAV939, increases the half-life of NICD in the chick and mouse PSM, leading to elevated NICD levels and a clear and robust prolonged period of clock gene oscillations and somite formation. Intriguingly, Gonzalez et al. previously reported exposure of mouse PSM explants to LiCl, which acts to inhibit GSK3B, lengthens the period of Hes7 oscillations in the mouse PSM. However, the authors report this effect may rather be via LiCl activation of the MapK pathway which is important for Hes expression in the PSM (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gonzalez et al., 2013</a>), since more specific approaches to elevate Wnt signalling have been shown not to change the endogenous period of the segmentation clock (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aulehla et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gibb et al., 2009</a>).

Importantly, these data separate the effects of the inhibitors on the segmentation clock from those on the cell cycle.

This raises the compelling prospect that these effects are causally linked. Recent data showing that Notch1 protein is dynamically and periodically expressed in the chick and mouse PSM in a Notch dependent fashion (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bone et al., 2014</a>) demonstrate that Notch1/NICD is itself part of a positive feedback loop. We experimentally validate the prediction that under conditions where half-life of NICD is increased, the period of the clock is extended. Our data thus expand upon previous models by highlighting the necessity for an added level of regulation, namely the strict regulation of the half-life for the positive input signal, NICD. Hence, it appears equally important to balance levels of both positive and negative input to correctly regulate the periodicity of clock gene oscillations. This result is similar to observations made in <i>Nrarp</i>-null mice, which display increased NICD levels in the PSM and a decrease in somite and vertebral body number although the pace of clock gene oscillations and somite size was not assessed (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kim et al., 2011</a>)."

                                "text": "Our data with the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 further substantiate the hypothesis that extended NICD half-life is causally linked to the extended clock period, given that this reagent, which acts via a completely distinct molecular mechanism, nevertheless leads to the same phenotypic output as the Wnt and CDK inhibitors. Thus, in addition to the expected higher levels of NICD in the PSM of MLN4924 treated explants, we saw a corresponding increase in the period of <i>Lfng</i> oscillations, as seen for XAV939, Roscovitine, DRB and PHA-767491 treated explants. In addition to elevating levels of NICD, exposure to MLN4924 elevates levels of phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin within PSM lysates. Since we show that Wnt inhibition can lead to elevated NICD levels and a delay to clock oscillations, this raises the possibility that the effects of MLN4924 are mediated via Wnt inhibition rather than directly via NICD turnover. However, we propose this is unlikely since in the absence of a degradation pathway the elevated levels of phosphorylated \u03b2\u00a0catenin may in fact continue to participate in target gene transcription. Indeed, APC mutant lines which allow \u03b2\u00a0catenin phosphorylation but are defective in ubiquitination are oncogenic, consistent with the idea that phosphorylated \u03b2\u00a0catenin can indeed activate target genes (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yang et al., 2006</a>). Thus, we propose that the extended period of the clock seen following exposure to MLN4924 is due to the elevated levels of NICD brought about via inhibition of NICD degradation. Exposure to higher concentrations of this inhibitor leads to correspondingly higher levels of NICD in PSM explants and this accompanies a loss of dynamic <i>Lfng</i> expression. A similar correlation is seen in PSM explants exposed to increasing concentrations of Roscovitine, DRB, PHA-767491. It has previously been shown that overexpression or complete loss of Notch signalling abolishes clock gene oscillations and causes severe segmentation defects (<a href=\"#bib51\">Niwa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Feller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ferjentsik et al., 2009</a>). These data, together with previous reports investigating the effect of modulating protein levels of key clock components (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hirata et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kim et al., 2011</a>), indicate that there is a tolerance window for the degree of variance in levels of positive and negative input which will still allow for oscillatory gene expression. These experimental findings are consistent with the predictions of our model which also clearly predict that there is a window within which variations in half-life of both Hes7 and NICD will allow for oscillations. Taken together, our computational and experimental data show that slowing, as opposed to stopping, of the segmentation clock gene oscillations may be brought about through transient and/or partial stabilisation of Notch activity."

We demonstrate that XAV939 treatment elevates levels of GSK3B-mediated phosphorylated \u03b2 catenin in the PSM and it is possible that it might equally facilitate GSK3B mediated phosphorylation of NICD which has previously been reported to affect NICD stability (<a href=\"#bib14\">Espinosa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jin et al., 2009</a>). It is noteworthy that the effect of this phosphorylation event on NICD stability is likely to be context dependent since different groups have reported this modification can increase or decrease NICD stability and it is not known if any of these interactions occur in the PSM (<a href=\"#bib18\">Foltz et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Espinosa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jin et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, it is possible that the CDK inhibitors modulate CDK-mediated phosphorylation of NICD which has also been reported to affect NICD stability (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fryer et al., 2004</a>). Interestingly, exposure to specific CDK7, CDK8 or CDK9 inhibitors did not yield the delayed oscillation phenotype or increased levels of NICD and half-life of NICD in the chick PSM (data not shown). These data are somewhat surprising given that there are published reports describing a role for CDK8 in phosphorylating and thereby destabilising NICD. Indeed, CDK8-mediated phosphorylation in the PEST domain of NICD is required to target this protein for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the E3 ligase FBW7 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fryer et al., 2004</a>). Whilst it is possible that this mode of regulation of NICD stability by this specific CDK does not occur in the PSM, we acknowledge that it is also possible that the effect on pace and cNICD stability are only made apparent when inhibiting a combination of these activities as seen with Roscovitine, DRB and PHA-76749. It is important to note that an alternative explanation for the lack of effect of specific CDK7, CDK8, or CDK9 inhibitors is that the effect of Roscovitine, DRB and PHA-767491 may be through inhibition of a different set of kinases. The precise identification of the kinase(s) involved in destabilising cNICD will require further investigation."

Roscovitine is known to have highest efficacy against CDK2/CyclinE, CDK5, CDK7/CyclinH and CDK9/CyclinT (<a href=\"#bib46\">McLue et al., 2002</a>) whereas DRB and PHA-767491 reduce the kinase activities of CDK7/CyclinH and CDK9/CyclinT towards Serine 2 and Serine 5 on the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA pol II. Exposure to DRB, Roscovitine, or PHA-767491 leads to a reduction in Ser5 RNA pol II phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) which is required to promote initiation of transcription as RNA pol II moves away from the gene promoter (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kormarnitsky et al., 2000</a>) but it is also associated with \u2018poised\u2019 genes bound by both Ser5 phosphorylated RNA pol II and Polycomb repressor complexes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brookes and Pombo, 2012</a>). Thus, one possibility is that reduced Ser5 phosphorylation of RNA pol II may leave some \u2018poised\u2019 genes in the PSM in a more repressed state. Importantly, certain gene transcripts are more susceptible to DRB treatment than others (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zandomeni and Weinmann, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chodosh et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wada et al., 1998</a>) and indeed we find not all gene transcripts in the PSM are down-regulated by these inhibitors (e.g., <i>cLfng</i> and <i>cHairy2</i> expression is delayed in the PSM but not down-regulated). Thus, the effects of these inhibitors may be to modify certain \u2018poised\u2019 genes to a more repressed state that specifically include genes encoding factors required for destabilising NICD."

For this particular gene we show it is unlikely to be involved in clock regulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

Further analyses are required to investigate if this is a conserved feature in all vertebrate species. That analysis notwithstanding, our data nevertheless clearly show that the pace of the segmentation clock itself has a strong influence upon the pace of somite formation since significantly fewer somites are formed within a given time-frame when the pace of clock gene oscillations and NICD stability are affected. In conclusion, our data suggest that the stability and turnover of NICD is inextricably linked to the regulation of the pace of clock gene expression across the PSM."

Explants were prepared as previously described (<a href=\"#bib54\">Palmeirim et al., 1997</a>). In brief, for the half-embryo assay: the caudal end of the chicken embryo is isolated to contain the most caudal somite pairs and the tail tissues. The isolated tail is then bisected down the midline along the neural tube to produce two identical left and right half-PSM explants which allows an internal control from the same embryo with which to compare the oscillation phase of <i>cLfng</i> expression by in situ hybridisation, following culturing of the two halves in various culture conditions. The following small molecule inhibitors were typically used at the given concentrations and dissolved in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) unless otherwise stated: 150 nM LY411575 unless otherwise stated (generated in house, University of Dundee; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ferjentsik et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bone et al., 2014</a>), 1 \u03bcM MLN4924 (generated in house, University of Dundee); 20 \u03bcM Cycloheximide (Tocris Bioscience; dissolved in ethanol); 100 \u03bcM XAV939 (Tocris Bioscience); 25\u201350 \u03bcM Cyclopamine (Calbiochem); 10 \u03bcM Roscovitine (Calbiochem); 10 \u03bcM 5,6-Dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) (Sigma, United Kingdom); 1 \u03bcM PHA-767491 (kind gift from Nathanael Gray, <a href=\"http://HARVARD.EDU\">HARVARD.EDU</a>). Titration assays were performed to establish the lowest concentration that abolishes expression of control target genes. For Fix and culture: both half-PSM explants were treated with inhibitor but while one was removed from culture after 3 hr (\u2018fix\u2019), the other side was cultured for an additional 45 min (\u2018culture\u2019) which corresponds to half of the usual 90 min cycle for a complete oscillation of <i>cLfng</i> in the chicken PSM. Variations include culturing the \u2018culture\u2019 side for \u201890\u2019 or \u2018120\u2019 min to determine the length of an oscillation. For the Western Blot analysis half-PSMs from 9 embryos were cultured in DMSO control vehicle and the corresponding 9 half-PSMs cultured in the presence of a small molecule inhibitor. Following 3 hr of culture, both pools were treated with 20 \u03bcM Cycloheximide for an additional 30 min before protein lysates were prepared simultaneously. For the half-life assay: half-PSMs from 9 embryos were pooled and both pools were cultured in each of the reagents for 3 hr and following 30 min exposure to cycloheximide, the decay of cNICD protein was monitored in the presence of these inhibitors by lysing PSM explants at different time points. Experiments were conducted in strict adherence to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 and UK Home Office Codes of Practice for use of animals in scientific procedures."

Some ideas were introducing a low level of RNAi to Notch1 to reduce Notch levels or treating with a gamma-secretase inhibitor to reduce NICD production or to increase FBXW7 levels. Alternately, another hypothesis discussed was to show that the clock period can be returned to normal by making NICD less stable (despite treating with a CDK or Tankyrase inhibitor). Other possibilities raised were locally raising NICD levels or changing half-life by removing the PEST domain. We realize that these are not necessarily the right experiments, and therefore would like to give you the option to respond to this criticism. Please take into account the major concerns raised by reviewers 1 and 2, appended below."

Given the delays inherent in Notch and DLL1 trafficking, cell surface presentation, and interactions, it seems possible that new NICD could be produced even in the presence of CHX, based on signaling through receptors that were made prior to initiation of CHX treatment. Thus, if any of the inhibitors increased the production of DLL1 or NOTCH1, for example, then the increases in NICD observed might be secondary to increased signaling, rather than a result of changes in protein turnover. Control experiments where inhibition of Notch signaling was initiated at the time of CHX treatment could address this concern, and provide additional support to the thesis that the effects the authors observe are due to changes in NICD half-life."

Otherwise the order of events remains unclear. Related to this, the last panel of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, which is not described in the Results section (and should be), suggests that levels of phosphorylated \u03b2 catenin are elevated following MLN4924 treatment.

Phosphorylated \u03b2 catenin is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the E3 ligase complex which is targeted by MLN4924. Thus, it is expected that exposure to this inhibitor leads to increased levels of phospho-\u2009\u03b2 catenin. However, we propose the effects of MLN4924 on levels of NICD and disruption of phase patterns are not via indirect effects upon Wnt signaling for the following reasons: elevated levels of phospho \u03b2catenin are indicative of \u0392catenin molecules that would normally be decommissioned from participating in Wnt signaling but which are prevented from being degraded by MLN4924. Moreover, elevated levels of phospho \u03b2catenin could in principle continue to participate in target gene transcription in the absence of a degradation pathway. If so it would mean MLN4924 potentially leads to elevated levels of Wnt signalling. Indeed, there are some APC mutant lines which allow \u03b2catenin phosphorylation but are defective in ubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yang et al., 2006</a> JBC). Given that these mutations are oncogenic, it would seem that phosphorylated \u03b2catenin can indeed activate target genes. Even if phospho \u03b2catenin cannot participate in target gene transcription, the phosphorylation decommissioning event is independent of MLN4924 and is thus happening at physiological levels and so again is not indicative of an inhibitor mediated block to Wnt signalling. Thus, we propose it is unlikely the extended period of the clock seen following exposure to MLN4924 is via Wnt inhibition but that rather it is due to the elevated levels of NICD brought about via inhibition of NICD degradation."
