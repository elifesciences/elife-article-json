The hormone auxin is redistributed in stimulated organs leading to differential growth and bending. Auxin application triggers rapid cell wall acidification and elongation of aerial organs of plants, but the molecular players mediating these effects are still controversial. Here we use genetically-encoded pH and auxin signaling sensors, pharmacological and genetic manipulations available for Arabidopsis etiolated hypocotyls to clarify how auxin is perceived and the downstream growth executed. We show that auxin-induced acidification occurs by local activation of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, which in the context of gravity response is restricted to the lower organ side. This auxin-stimulated acidification and growth require TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA nuclear auxin perception. In addition, auxin-induced gene transcription and specifically SAUR proteins are crucial downstream mediators of this growth. Our study provides strong experimental support for the acid growth theory and clarified the contribution of the upstream auxin perception mechanisms."

This has several crucial consequences for plant multicellularity: (vascular) plant cells do not move, and they grow mostly symplastically (no sliding occurs; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib35\">Lintilhac, 2014</a>). Thus plant shapes and patterns are sculptured by the\u00a0precise orientation of cell division and tight control of growth. Growth depends on a balance between the turgor pressure (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ray et al., 1972</a>) and the yielding of the cell wall to this pressure (<a href=\"#bib22\">Heyn, 1940</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lockhart, 1965</a>)."

In fact, this feature was used to define and discover auxins in a coleoptile bending test (e.g. <a href=\"#bib63\">Went and Thimann, 1937</a>). More specifically, applied auxin induces growth of decapitated organs that are depleted of auxin. Auxin-induced growth is characterized by acidification of the cell wall. Acidification of the growth media is sufficient to trigger growth in certain conditions; therefore the term 'acid growth' is often used (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib30\">Kutschera, 1994</a>). Auxin induces extrusion of protons into the apoplast, activating expansins in the cell wall (<a href=\"#bib38\">McQueen-Mason, 1992</a>), which in turn leads to weakening of the cell wall and to growth. The central players in this process are the plasma membrane (PM) P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases \u2013 AHAs. By inducing the expression of SAUR19 protein that inactivates a PP2C-family phosphatase, auxin application results into phosphorylation of the critical Thr residue in the autoinhibitory domain of AHA, which leads to activation of the proton pump (<a href=\"#bib60\">Takahashi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Spartz et al., 2014</a>). At the same time, by pumping protons into the apoplastic space, the PM is hyperpolarized, which drives the opening of voltage-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> inward-rectifying channels (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hedrich et al., 1995</a>), leading to accumulation of K<sup>+</sup> ions and turgor increase in the cell. On the other hand, the acid growth theory does not seem to be valid in the roots (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pacheco-Villalobos et al., 2016</a>)."

According to the Cholodny-Went theory, the asymmetrical distribution of auxin leads to the bending of the organ (<a href=\"#bib63\">Went and Thimann, 1937</a>). Upon a directional stimulus of the shoot, auxin is redistributed by the PIN and ABCB proteins to the cells of the side which will elongate (<a href=\"#bib12\">Friml et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Noh et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rakusov\u00e1 et al., 2011</a>). Consequently, these cells experience a sudden increase of auxin concentration and react by elongation. Also more generally, auxin is crucial for growth of aerial organs, as stated by <a href=\"#bib63\">Went and Thimann (1937)</a>: \u201cOhne Wuchsstoff kein Wachstum \u2013 without auxin no growth\u201d."

                        "text": "Currently, the literature considers at least two receptors for auxin: the nuclear TIR1/AFB Aux/IAA co-receptor (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</a>), and the Auxin Binding Protein 1 (ABP1) (<a href=\"#bib37\">L\u00f6bler and Kl\u00e4mbt, 1985</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib16\">Grones and Friml, 2015</a>). The TIR1 pathway operates by the de-repression of transcription of auxin-induced genes, while the ABP1 pathway was proposed to regulate activities of proteins directly, and thus can operate immediately after auxin perception. Although auxin-induced growth is one of the oldest experimental questions in plant physiology, there is no agreement on how auxin is perceived during this process. This controversy stems from several facts: auxin-induced growth starts only approximately 15 min after application (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kutschera, 1994</a>), and requires novel protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Edelmann and Schopfer, 1989</a>), hinting to the involvement of the nuclear TIR1/AFB Aux/IAA pathway. The major support for the nuclear auxin pathway involvement is the regulation of AHA activity by SAUR19 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Spartz et al., 2014</a>), a member of a family of very small proteins the expression of which is rapidly induced by auxin. Recently, the significance of the ABP1 pathway has been undermined by the lack of any obvious developmental phenotypes of the <i>abp1</i> knockout mutants (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grones et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gao et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Michalko et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2016</a>). Despite these recent findings, there is also evidence demonstrating the importance of the ABP1 pathway, obtained by approaches and methods other than knock-out mutants. In protoplasts auxin induces rapid PM hyperpolarization and swelling that can be blocked by ABP1 antibodies (<a href=\"#bib32\">Leblanc et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yamagami et al., 2004</a>). Moreover, <a href=\"#bib53\">Schenck et al. (2010)</a> concluded that the TIR1/AFB pathway is not involved in auxin-induced elongation, based on the fact that a quadruple <i>tir1/afb</i> mutant still responds to auxin by elongation. Furthermore, <a href=\"#bib60\">Takahashi et al. (2012)</a> report that the AHA PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is still phosphorylated, and thus activated, upon auxin application in a double <i>tir1-1 afb2-3</i> mutant."

We aim to solve how auxin is perceived during auxin-induced growth, and whether there are any rapid, \u2018non-genomic\u2019 components of this response. By analyzing lines that overexpress stabilized version of the SAUR protein or by genetically activating the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases we attempt to clarify whether the acid growth hypothesis is valid in the Arabidopsis hypocotyl. Finally, we test how the results from the auxin-induced growth experiments relate to the <i>in vivo</i> situation on the example of gravitropic response. The combination of genetic tools and techniques that have become available enabled us to systematically re-evaluate this classical question in plant biology."

                                "text": "When grown in darkness, hypocotyls of plants rapidly elongate, and this elongation is fueled by the auxin from the cotyledons. Therefore, the etiolated hypocotyl is an excellent experimental model for auxin-induced elongation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schenck et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Takahashi et al., 2012</a>). In this work we used three-day-old etiolated hypocotyls of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We used the auxin analog NAA, to ensure that auxin penetrates the hypocotyl segment well, and is not degraded by light during the experiments. NAA is stable, readily enters cells by diffusion, and is a substrate for auxin efflux carriers (<a href=\"#bib7\">Delbarre et al., 1996</a>). In the etiolated hypocotyl of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, depleted of endogenous auxin by decapitation, auxin induced growth with a delay of approximately 20 min (19.75 \u00b1 2.9\u2009min stdev, n = 12) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To ensure that this delay is not an artifact of the experimental system, we used the fungal toxin fusicoccin (FC; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ballio et al., 1964</a>) that activates the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by enabling binding of an activating 14-3-3 protein to the pump (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baunsgaard et al., 1998</a>), and so triggers apoplast acidification and growth. Application of FC triggered growth in 6\u20138 min after its application (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To monitor the transcriptional response to auxin, we needed a reporter that would be more rapid than transcriptional GFP reporters, as fluorescent proteins require significant time to mature and become fluorescent (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shaner et al., 2005</a>). The Firefly luciferase enzyme is, on the other hand, active immediately after its translation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kolb et al., 1994</a>). Therefore we used the auxin response reporter DR5 driving the expression of Firefly luciferase enzyme \u2013 DR5::LUC (<a href=\"#bib44\">Moreno-Risueno et al., 2010</a>). Accordingly to the growth onset, nuclear auxin response could be detected 20 min after auxin application (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To visualize the auxin-induced acidification and thus approximate the activity of the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, we used the genetically encoded apoplastic pH sensor apo-pHusion (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gjetting et al., 2012</a>). Similar to the growth initiation and the nuclear auxin signaling, a sudden drop in apoplastic pH could be detected 20 min (20.11 \u00b1 5\u2009min stdev, n = 12) after auxin application (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). We developed a MATLAB-based tool that we named AreaKymo in order to be able to visualize and quantify apoplastic pH changes in an un-biased way. The apo-pHusion pH sensor consists of mRFP (insensitive to pH changes) and GFP (responsive to pH changes). AreaKymo selects the cell wall areas based on RFP fluorescence, measures RFP and GFP intensities in each pixel, and plots these pixels in a time-space plot. Using AreaKymo, the delay between auxin application and apoplast acidification is clearly visible (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Again, in the case of FC, the apoplast acidification followed immediately after its application (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The \u2018acid growth\u2019 literature often discusses the necessity to abrade the stem segments in order to achieve proper penetration of the drugs into the tissue (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kutschera, 1994</a>). Our results show that in the case of the comparably minute Arabidopsis hypocotyl segments, auxin enters the tissue rapidly, inducing growth, acidification, and transcriptional auxin response within approximately 20 min. If we take into account the velocity of auxin transport in Arabidopsis ~8\u2009mm hr<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib29\">Kramer et al., 2011</a>), auxin should reach the middle of the hypocotyl segment (~1.2\u2009mm) in ~4.5 min. Our results are thus in a good agreement with the published timescale of auxin-induced elongation (17\u2009min in <a href=\"#bib30\">Kutschera, 1994</a>). Most importantly, we directly visualized auxin-induced acidification, transcriptional response to auxin, and segment elongation, all of which are tightly correlated in time and happen with an approximately 20-min lag phase after auxin application."

                                "text": "To test whether protein synthesis is necessary for these rapid auxin responses, we pre-treated hypocotyl segments with cycloheximide (CHI), a protein synthesis inhibitor. As a control to test for the ability of the cells to grow, we used FC, the application of which triggers growth, bypassing the entire auxin signaling pathway (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Application of CHI completely blocked auxin-induced growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), while FC-induced growth was only slightly decreased. This decrease was evident in the later phases of growth, when the lack of protein synthesis might affect the overall status of the cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This result demonstrates that protein synthesis is not necessary for growth as such; hypocotyl segments are able to grow for some time without protein synthesis. However, protein synthesis is absolutely required for <i>auxin</i>-induced growth. Furthermore, CHI treatment completely inhibited the auxin-induced apoplast acidification (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and auxin response, visualized by the DR5::LUC reporter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This result is consistent with previous results in maize coleoptiles and pea internode segments, where CHI blocked auxin-induced growth (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lado et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Edelmann and Schopfer, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kutschera, 1994</a>). Other studies reported auxin-induced growth in the presence of CHI (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rose, 1974</a>). It was also shown that Small Auxin Up mRNAs (SAUR) accumulate in hypocotyl segments after CHI treatment (<a href=\"#bib11\">Franco et al., 1990</a>), but without translation, these mRNAs are not able to trigger growth. In our experimental setup, the total inhibition of the DR5::LUC response by CHI leaves no space for doubts that the CHI treatment was effective, and so demonstrates the necessity of protein synthesis for the auxin growth response, further supporting the involvement of the nuclear auxin pathway. Finally, we used auxinole that binds to the TIR1 auxin co-receptor and blocks the formation of the TIR1-auxin-Aux/IAA complex (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hayashi et al., 2012</a>). Treatment with auxinole led to a decrease in the nuclear auxin response visualized by DR5::LUC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), and resulted in a large decrease in auxin-induced growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), while FC-induced growth still occurred. This result strengthens the hypothesis that the nuclear auxin receptors are perceiving auxin in the hypocotyls to mediate apoplastic pH changes, growth, and probably maintenance of the turgor pressure, necessary for continued growth."

                                "text": "Previous works established that multiple mutations in the TIR1/AFB pathway do not inhibit the auxin-induced growth of the hypocotyl (<a href=\"#bib60\">Takahashi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schenck et al., 2010</a>), and it was suggested that auxin is perceived by the ABP1 pathway, the null mutants of which were not available at that time. We therefore set out to test the new mutants in the ABP1 gene (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gao et al., 2015</a>). The new <i>abp1</i> null mutants\u2019 reaction to auxin was identical to that of the control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In the works using the multiple <i>tir1/afb</i> mutants, the nuclear auxin pathway was not completely eliminated, most likely due to the redundancy of the 6 TIR1/AFB receptors. It is also important to note that the development of the higher order mutant is seriously affected, and the phenotypes range from normal-looking plants to seriously stunted plants lacking a root (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</a>), making it very difficult to assess their physiology. As reported previously, a <i>tir1-1/afb2-1/afb3-1</i> triple mutant still responded normally to auxin (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). In our hands, the quadruple <i>tir1-1/afb1-3/afb2-3/afb3-4</i> mutant was hardly able to form a hypocotyl in which we could assess the growth reaction to auxin. To circumvent the problem with the redundancy in the TIR1/AFB, we focused on the second part of auxin co-receptor \u2013 the Aux/IAA proteins. We used the <i>axr3-1</i> mutant that harbors a mutation in the DII domain of the IAA17 gene, leading to a semi-dominant auxin-resistant phenotype (<a href=\"#bib33\">Leyser et al., 1996</a>), expressed from the heat shock-inducible promoter \u2013 <i>HS::axr3-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Knox et al., 2003</a>). After induction of the <i>axr3-1</i> protein, hypocotyls responded to FC treatment by rapid growth identical to that of control, but their reaction to auxin was completely inhibited (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Without induction, the behavior was identical to that of the control (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). We introduced the apoplastic pH sensor apo-pHusion into the <i>HS::axr3-1</i> background and analyzed the apoplastic acidification. Induction of the <i>axr3-1</i> protein completely prevented the auxin-induced apoplastic acidification (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), fitting with the original agravitropic and short hypocotyl phenotype of <i>axr3-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Leyser et al., 1996</a>). These results again show that auxin-induced growth is downstream of the TIR1/AFB Aux/IAA co-receptor. Even the auxin-induced apoplast acidification requires the degradation of Aux/IAAs and auxin-induced gene expression, and is not mediated directly by a putative auxin receptor."

In the Col-0 background, picloram induced growth, DR5::LUC auxin response, and apoplast acidification, although more slowly than NAA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>). We then tested the growth response of the mutant in the AFB5 receptor, <i>afb5-5.</i> As expected, it was less sensitive to picloram (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) in the auxin-induced hypocotyl elongation, while the reaction to NAA and fusicoccin was comparable to that of control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4C</a>). The auxin signaling pathway exhibits a homeostatic nature and contains several negative and positive feedback loops. For example, it is known that auxin-induced genes are able to suppress auxin response (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mellor et al., 2016</a>). The combination of the <i>afb5-5</i> mutant, a normal looking plant, with the picloram auxin analogue treatment creates an unprecedented situation, where the decreased reaction of the <i>afb5-5</i> mutant to the auxin analogue picloram can get manifested and confirms the crucial role of the TIR1/AFB pathway in auxin-induced hypocotyl elongation. It remains a question why the picloram-induced DR5 response, acidification and growth show a delay when compared to NAA. It is possible that AFB5 has partially different functions than the other TIR/AFBs or that picloram needs more time to enter the cells of the hypocotyl segment."

To address the downstream components involved, we looked at the SAUR proteins. SAURs form a family of very small, short-lived proteins that are rapidly induced by auxin application (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ren and Gray, 2015</a>), and act downstream of the TIR1/AFB Aux/IAA auxin co-receptor. In a recent publication, <a href=\"#bib59\">Spartz et al. (2014)</a> showed that the SAUR19 protein indirectly activates the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. They found that tagging SAUR19 with GFP leads to its stabilization and confers overexpression phenotypes. The <i>35S::GFP-SAUR19</i> line evoked up to 35% higher H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activities and increased cell expansion, as compared to Col-0. The <i>35S::GFP-SAUR19</i> line behavior in our experimental system was remarkable. After decapitation, the hypocotyl segments elongated on the control medium without auxin, and the\u00a0addition of auxin did not lead to further stimulation of growth (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We analyzed the apoplastic pH in the F1 cross between the <i>35S::GFP-SAUR19</i> and the apo-pHusion marker line. In the control (Col-0 x apo-pHusion) the apoplastic pH rises and growth stops quickly after decapitation, while apoplastic pH remained acidic in the <i>35S::GFP-SAUR19</i> background and the growth continued (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). SAUR genes are arranged in clusters on chromosomes and encode very small proteins, which likely enables very rapid production of these proteins upon perception of auxin. Moreover, SAUR proteins are extremely short-lived (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ren and Gray, 2015</a>), meaning that transcriptional regulation is a crucial determinant of their abundance. Stabilization of SAUR proteins leads to increased cell elongation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Spartz et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib59\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chae et al., 2012</a>). These properties make SAUR proteins a suitable \u2018gearbox\u2019 of growth that is able to rapidly respond to changing conditions, while involving the relatively slow transcription and translation steps. Our results show that SAUR proteins mediate the signal between nuclear auxin perception and auxin-induced growth execution, but it is important to note that the conclusion is based mainly on the overexpression of a stabilized version of the SAUR19 protein."

In Arabidopsis, the AHA family has 11 members, of which AHA2 and its close homolog AHA1 together contribute about 70\u201380% of the total H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. While individual <i>aha1</i> or <i>aha2</i> showed only modest phenotypes such as impaired root growth on alkaline pH, the double mutant is embryo-lethal (<a href=\"#bib18\">Haruta et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Haruta and Sussmann, 2012</a>). To clarify the functional relationship of auxin and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases directly <i>in planta</i>, we took advantage of the availability of dominant mutations (<i>ost2</i>) available for the <i>AHA1</i> locus that render the pump constitutively active (<a href=\"#bib40\">Merlot et al., 2007</a>). Although the over-expressing <i>35S::GFP-SAUR19</i> transgenic lines have been described to behave comparably to the <i>ost2-2D</i> mutant in several tests, we found that decapitated <i>ost2-2D</i> showed no or minor auxin-independent growth (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). As constitutive mutations are not known for AHA2, we nonetheless created a double mutant by combining the <i>aha2-5</i> knock out with the <i>ost2-2D</i>, so that of the two main isoforms of AHAs, one is constitutively active and the other one absent. Indeed, the <i>ost2-2D/aha2-5</i> hypocotyl segments elongated in the absence of auxin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), more than the <i>ost2-2D</i> single mutants. The <i>ost2-2D/aha2-5</i> also showed a slightly decreased reaction to fusicoccin compared to <i>ost2-2D</i> and Col-0 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These results provided additional insight into the functions of the two pump subunits: not only AHA1 and AHA2 play redundant roles, they are also interdependent. At least a notable fraction of the mature PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases in the plant cell might be hetero-oligomers of AHA1 and AHA2 subunits (a mature pump is thought to be a hexamer; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kanczewska et al., 2005</a>). In the complete absence of AHA2, the equilibrium in the composition of the mature pump complex would shift towards more of the <i>ost2-2D</i> subunits. However, the ability of <i>ost2-2D/aha2-5</i> to elongate without auxin did not reach the magnitude of the <i>35S::GFP-SAUR19</i> plants. There are several possible explanations of this difference. Other of the 11 PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases might be activated by the SAUR proteins, or other sites of the auto-inhibitory loop might be regulated than those mutated in <i>ost2-2D</i>. Alternatively, the 'acid growth' explanation of SAUR action is not sufficient, and SAURs might target multiple proteins that initiate the growth response; and activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases is only a part of their action."

Approximately 4\u2009hr after transfer on the induction medium, hypocotyl segments of <i>AHA2<sup>\u03b495</sup></i>started to elongate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). The auxin-independent growth of <i>AHA2<sup>\u03b495</sup></i>was similar to that of <i>35S::GFP-SAUR19</i>. Based on these results we conclude that in the hypocotyls, strong activation of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases is sufficient to trigger growth and can explain the auxin-independent elongation phenotype caused by the overexpression of stabilized SAUR19 protein. The strongest effect of GFP-SAUR19 overexpression can be explained by the fact that SAURs might regulate all PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, while our genetic manipulation always influences only some of them. This corroborates the crucial role of the SAUR proteins in mediating auxin-induced growth, and it also means that in contrast to the roots (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pachecon-Villalobos et al., 2016</a>) the acid growth hypothesis seems to be valid in the hypocotyls."

During gravistimulation of the shoot, auxin is redistributed to the lower side of the gravistimulated organ where it triggers growth, which in turn leads to bending of the organ (<a href=\"#bib63\">Went and Thimann, 1937</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Harrison and Pickard, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Friml et al., 2002</a>). Using the DR5rev::GFP auxin response marker (<a href=\"#bib3\">Benkov\u00e1 et al., 2003</a>) or the DII-Venus marker (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brunoud et al., 2012</a>) we were unable to observe differences in auxin signaling early (1\u2009hr) after gravistimulation. The reason is that the GFP-based markers are too slow to show differences in such a short time, and the DII-Venus marker is extremely weak in the etiolated hypocotyls, most likely due to a high level of auxin in this elongating tissue (data not shown). Gravistimulated hypocotyls bend visibly 20\u201340 min after gravistimulation (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Since our results point to acidification being an early detectable outcome of gravistimulation, we analyzed apoplastic pH in the upper and lower sides of gravistimulated etiolated hypocotyls using the apo-pHusion marker. One hour after gravistimulation, the lower side cell walls were visibly more acidic than the upper ones (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). In non-gravistimulated hypocotyls, both sides showed either similar pH, or one of the sides was more acidic than the other, without a tendency to the left or right side (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This could reflect the fact that vertically-growing hypocotyls do not grow completely straight, but gently wave during growth (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Interestingly, plants expressing a stabilized version of the SAUR63 showed an increased waviness of hypocotyls and stems (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chae et al., 2012</a>). <a href=\"#bib23\">Hohm et al. (2014)</a> suggest that apoplast acidification is necessary for creating an auxin gradient upon directional light stimulus. Based on the fact that auxin asymmetry is established very quickly after gravistimulation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Harrison and Pickard, 1989</a>), we suggest that during gravitropism, the observed apoplast acidification asymmetry is downstream of nuclear auxin signaling and is a part of the execution of auxin response. The asymmetry of acidification has been approximated before using a pH-sensitive dye to visualize differential pH in vicinity of gravistimulated aerial organs (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mulkey et al., 1981</a>). We show that the apoplast itself is more acidic on the lower side of the bending hypocotyl, which fits with the results obtained with external auxin application."

This in fact means that these hypocotyls are <i>functionally insensitive</i> to auxin or to the absence of auxin. Because of this insensitivity, this line should be unable to respond to the redistribution of auxin during gravitropism. Also the <i>ost2-2D/aha2-5</i> line showed significant auxin-independent elongation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, lines that showed auxin-independent growth in the elongation assays also responded less to gravistimulation than the control, resulting in a smaller gravitropic bending angle. This means that the ability to respond properly to the relocation of auxin is compromised in these lines, resulting in a decreased growth gradient between the upper and lower sides of gravistimulated hypocotyls.

We showed that after auxin application, nuclear auxin signaling, apoplast acidification and growth occur with a similar lag phase of approximately 20 min. This is not an artifact of the model system, as the drug fusicoccin is able to trigger growth and acidification in a time substantially shorter, and without triggering the nuclear auxin response. Both the auxin-induced apoplast acidification and growth require new protein synthesis, Aux/IAA protein degradation, and are dependent on the SAUR proteins (<a href=\"#bib59\">Spartz et al., 2014</a>). In other words, no non-genomic auxin pathway is required to acidify the apoplast and regulate growth in the hypocotyl. This contrasts with the situation in the root, where auxin inhibits growth very rapidly (<a href=\"#bib43\">Monshausen et al., 2011</a>) and may act via different mechanism. In the hypocotyl, the <i>afb5-5</i> mutant shows a clear reduction of the reaction to the auxin analogue picloram, further confirming the involvement of the TIR1/AFB Aux/IAA auxin co-receptor complex. Furthermore, overexpression of stabilized SAUR19 protein (<a href=\"#bib58\">Spartz et al., 2012</a>)\u00a0causes auxin-independent hypocotyl segment growth that can be also achieved by genetic activation of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, strengthening the concept of acid growth hypothesis. Using genetically-encoded apoplastic pH marker, we could directly monitor apoplast acidification <i>in situ</i> during auxin-induced growth and during gravitropism. The lines that showed auxin independent growth display problems with gravitropic bending, which demonstrates the necessity of acidification and growth gradient formation across the bending organ. It remains to be solved whether the SAUR-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases activation is the only mechanism that triggers cell elongation, or whether SAUR proteins have other targets that are responsible for growth regulation. We are lacking tools to monitor PM hyperpolarization in-vivo, which is tightly linked to apoplast acidification, and is crucial for regulating ion fluxes over the PM and turgor regulation. It will be interesting to address the dynamics of cell wall properties and turgor pressure using this model system. The fact that auxin-induced growth of the hypocotyl utilizes the relatively slow gene transcription and protein synthesis to regulate its growth, illustrates that plant tropisms do not need to be instantaneous, as the changes in direction of gravity or light are relatively slow as well."

The apo-pHusion marker line for the elongation experiments was imaged using ZEISS LSM700 confocal microscope with a 20x/0.8 Plan-Apochromat M27 objective. GFP and RFP were imaged simultaneously, splitting the light with a SP550 and LP560 filters, 16bits per pixel, excited using 488 and 555\u00a0nm diode lasers. Hypocotyls were decapitated and depleted on the depletion medium, as described above, then the segments were transplanted onto medium with the indicated treatment and transferred into LabTekkII chambered coverslide and imaged. Alternatively, the treatment was pipetted to the samples during imaging on the confocal microscope. For the apo-pHusion imaging during the gravitropic response, seeds were plated into channels 0.25\u00a0mm deep and 0.5\u00a0mm wide that were stamped into 1.5% agarose with \u00bdMS, 1% sucrose. After one day of germination, the channels with seeds were covered with a microscopic coverglass and the plates were wrapped in aluminum foil and grown for additional three days. Then the plates were gravistimulated for 1\u2009hr, and taken directly for imaging at a confocal microscope. This way, the original position of the gravistimulated organ was maintained and the handling was minimized. Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope equipped with GaAsP detectors and using a 20x/0.8 Plan-Apochromat M27 objective was used, and imaged analogously to the ZEISS LSM700 settings. Luciferase luminescence was imaged using a darkbox equipped with a Photometrics evolve EMCCD camera with a 17\u00a0mm fixed lens/0.95. The exposure time was 110\u00a0s."

The kymographs were done using the Multiple Kymograph ImageJ plugin (<a href=\"http://www.embl.de/eamnet/html/body_kymograph.html\">http://www.embl.de/eamnet/html/body_kymograph.html</a>). To achieve unbiased measurements, the length of hypocotyl segments was measured by thresholding the scanner images, manual clicking on each segment using the Wand tool (Fiji) and recording their Feret\u2019s diameter (maximum caliper), this was done for the entire time series. The initial length of the segment was taken as 100%, data was analyzed in Excel. The results in the figures represent one of three repetitions of each experiment, which is based on quantification of 6 hypocotyl segments. For confocal time series, image drift was stabilized using the StackReg Fiji plugin in the \u2018translation\u2019 option. Luciferase luminescence was measured by selecting the region of interest containing the hypocotyl segment and measuring the mean intensity in this region over time. The apoplastic pH visualized by the apo-pHusion marker was measured both manually and automatically by the AreaKymo MATLAB script. Manual measurement was done by thresholding the cell wall area based on the RFP channel, using this thresholded area as a base for a region of interest (using the \u2018create selection\u2019 command), and then measuring the mean intensity in these regions both for GFP and RFP channels. For the gravitropic experiment, each z-section of the image was measured individually. The AreaKymo script essentially does the same procedure, but does so automatically without the user input, allowing for rapid processing of several hypocotyls at a time. The user specifies the value of the threshold for the RFP signal (this is set arbitrarily to highlight just the cell wall area) and the desired width of the rectangle that will represent the individual timeframe. The script outputs the visual representation of apoplastic pH and also the values in a form of a series of boxplots. The AreaKymo script is provided in <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. To measure the bending of hypocotyls after gravistimulation, the angle of the upper part of the hypocotyl was measured 6\u2009hr after gravistimulation. Numerical data for the graphs and figures can be found in the Source Data files 1\u20136, each corresponds to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and the <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The hypocotyl images in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D and E</a> were done using the \u2018temporal color code\u2019 command of Fiji, with the \u2018spectrum\u2019 look-up-table option. Figures were assembled in the Inkscape program (<a href=\"http://www.inkscape.org\">www.inkscape.org</a>). Boxplots and stripcharts were created in R (3.2.0) via the RStudio interface."

                    "text": "This manuscript concerns the function of the plant hormone auxin in rapid elongation of the Arabidopsis hypocotyl. Evidence accumulated over many years suggests that cell expansion in the hypocotyl occurs through acid growth. Auxin is thought to activate plasma membrane H-ATPase, either indirectly or indirectly, and thereby acidify the apoplast resulting in changes in the cell wall. Recent studies suggest that the H-ATPase is activated by phosphorylation, and that this achieved by SAUR dependent inhibition of a PP2C phosphatase. Although there is some evidence for each component of this model, there is no information of the auxin receptor that mediates this growth response. In this paper, the authors use excised hypocotyls from etiolated seedlings as their model. Using this system, they show that changes in growth and acidification of the apoplast are correlated in time. Further, they show that these responses are dependent on protein synthesis implying that they involve changes in transcription/translation. A novel and important finding is that growth is also correlated with an increase in auxin transcriptional response as measured by a DR5:LUC reporter. Most significantly they also show that these effects are dependent on the TIR1/AFB receptor system but not ABP1. The authors make elegant use of the afb5-5 mutation. These plants are resistant to the synthetic auxin picloram but are otherwise normal in appearance. By showing that afb5 is resistant to the rapid effects of picloram on growth, the authors demonstrate that AFB5 is required for the response to auxin. It follows that the TIR1/AFB receptors act to mediate the response to endogenous auxin."

These results are in complete agreement with our current model where fusicoccin is binding to and stabilized the activated form of the pump (via binding to the phopshoTh947 in concert with 14-3-3) whereas the SAUR gene must be expressed as a mRNA and then translated to make a SAUR protein that then binds to the protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates Thr947.

Since auxin uptake is likely to involve proton mediated symporters or antiporters and auxin efflux is likely to be an electrogenic efflux of the negatively charged auxin ion, there are likely to be very rapid changes in the PMF (equal to sum of \u03b4 pH and EMF) that may be small and unrelated to the auxin growth response. Use of citations in the literature (e.g. protoplast swelling) that are not replicated in this work, and whose reproducibility and relevance to auxin induced growth as measured in this carefully done report, detracts from its credibility to readers. For example, in the subsection \u201cConclusions\u201d, it is unclear why the protoplast swelling phenomenon is even mentioned since it has nothing to do with this paper. On face value the lack of a phenotype in the abp1 mutant suggests that the effects of ABP1 on protoplasts are not important. Given the importance of auxin action in plant life, and the confusion and poorly interpreted experiments presented in the past, the authors should pause, stay close to their own data and double check their writing and interpretations."

More specifically, we clarified how auxin is perceived during this process, and showed that there are no obvious \u2018rapid\u2019 responses to auxin in the hypocotyl growth. Very importantly, by visualizing apoplastic pH we also demonstrate that auxin-induced acidification is not a \u2018rapid, non-genomic\u2019 effect, but instead requires the nuclear auxin signaling pathway. These questions were unanswered in the field and needed to be sorted out. We did not want to specifically state which pieces are novel in our text, we think this is not appropriate, but here we can state that not only the above mentioned questions have really not been answered, but also the apoplastic pH in situ observation after auxin application has not been shown before, as wasn\u2019t the apoplastic pH behavior during gravitropism. Yes, the behavior of stabilized Aux/IAA mutant during gravitropism has been shown before, but we also show that the ost2-2D/aha2-5 mutant has a problem bending, which we put into context of the elongation assays and compare it to the behavior of the GFP-SAUR19 plants. Because of the nature of the manuscript, we were trying to be extremely careful with referencing the existing literature wherever possible throughout the text. We would welcome any specific suggestion on literature that we might have missed. In summary, this work clarified several decades-lasting controversies and given how important the auxin-induced growth is as experimental topic in plant hormone biology \u2013 we find this a very important contribution."

The DR5 promoter needs to be activated, luciferase protein needs to be transcribed and translated and the luminescent product needs to accumulate to be detected. Therefore, it is probable that auxin enters the hypocotyl very rapidly, and the delay is caused by the auxin signaling machinery and transcription and translation of the executor genes."

We could see auxin-independent growth when the active AHA1 (ost2-2D) was in the aha2-5 mutant background, but still the magnitude of the response could not be compared to the effect of SAUR19-GFP overexpressor. During the review process, the Pacheco-Villalobos et al. paper introduced the AHA2<sup>delta95</sup> line, where the non-regulated, active AHA2 ATPase can be expressed inducibly. We tested this line for the auxin-independent growth, and found that ~4 hours after the transgene induction, a rapid growth can be observed. Even though this again is an experiment based on the strong overexpression, it clearly shows that activation of H-ATPases is sufficient to trigger elongation of the hypocotyl segments. Still, acid growth hypothesis is probably a simplification, as the acidification of the apoplast is only a part of the processes \u2013 activation of the pump will hyperpolarize the membrane and increase the proton motive force, which is crucial for maintaining or increasing the turgor pressure.

Since auxin uptake is likely to involve proton mediated symporters or antiporters and auxin efflux is likely to be an electrogenic efflux of the negatively charged auxin ion, there are likely to be very rapid changes in the PMF (equal to sum of \u03b4 pH and EMF) that may be small and unrelated to the auxin growth response. Use of citations in the literature (e.g. protoplast swelling) that are not replicated in this work, and whose reproducibility and relevance to auxin induced growth as measured in this carefully done report, detracts from its credibility to readers. For example, in the subsection \u201cConclusions\u201d, it is unclear why the protoplast swelling phenomenon is even mentioned since it has nothing to do with this paper. On face value the lack of a phenotype in the abp1 mutant suggests that the effects of ABP1 on protoplasts are not important. Given the importance of auxin action in plant life, and the confusion and poorly interpreted experiments presented in the past, the authors should pause, stay close to their own data and double check their writing and interpretations.</i> "

We do not feel competent to say that the protoplast swelling papers that we referred to are \u2018poorly interpreted\u2019.
