The common definition is that evolution is the temporal dynamics of gene frequencies or phenotype distributions, or generally the change over time of important characteristics of populations of organisms. Such dynamics are thought to occur if there is heritable variation in these characteristics, and if individuals with different characteristics survive and reproduce at different rates, i.e., have different \u201dfitness\" (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lewontin, 1970</a>). This view of evolution is largely descriptive, and the conditions for evolution to occur have some tautological aspects (evolution occurs when fitter types have more offspring; see, for example, <a href=\"#bib1\">Ariew and Lewontin, 2004</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"#bib7\">Dawkins, 1982</a>). This is as if in statistical physics, one would define heat transfer to occur when some objects get warmer and others colder under the condition that there is a difference in temperature between different objects. In statistical physics, a more mechanistic theory instead allows temperature and heat transfer to be seen as emergent properties of the interactions between the components of matter (such as molecules), and of the complex dynamics that these interactions generate."

In this approach, the long-term dynamics of genotype or phenotype distributions become an emergent property of the underlying birth-death process. While this line of thought might appear to be straightforward, it leads us to question a number of evolutionary concepts that are held dearly by many. After presenting a general description of evolution as a birth-death process, we discuss some implications of this approach for the concepts of fitness and optimality, for the relationship between ecology and evolution, for social evolution and multi-level selection, and for cultural evolution. Even though in full generality, evolutionary birth-death processes are mathematically intractable, in all these areas a mechanistic model of evolution generates unified perspectives that will be useful for clarifying empirical questions, as well as for future developments in evolutionary theory."

From a simplified, yet general perspective, the fundamental processes that give rise to evolution in the biosphere are that individual organisms give birth and die at certain rates (or, equivalently, with certain probabilities per unit time). Individuals have properties, such as genotypes or phenotypes, or age and physiological state, and their birth and death rates depend on these properties. However, in general an individual\u2019s birth and death rates also depend on many other things, such as the number and properties of other individuals in the evolving population, properties of individuals in other populations, and the external environment. As a consequence, birth and death rates typically vary in time as populations and the environment change. To obtain a general model of evolution, consider a population of individuals <math id=\"inf1\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>,</mo><mo>\u2026</mo><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>, where <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi id=\"XM9\">t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> is the population size at the current time <math id=\"inf3\"><mi>t</mi></math>, and <math id=\"inf4\"><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></math> is the type of the <math id=\"inf5\"><mi>i</mi></math>-th individual.

This generates a basic feedback loop that has the potential to generate complexity in the evolutionary process (this feedback loop is traditionally referred to as frequency dependence, (<a href=\"#bib27\">Heino et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Metz and Geritz, 2016</a>).

This is true both for the theoretical (e.g. population genetic) and the empirical literature, as well as in popular accounts of evolution (\u201dsurvival of the fittest\"). A common metaphor in evolutionary biology is the fitness landscape (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wright, 1932</a>). Formally, a fitness landscape is a scalar function on type space whose maxima correspond to \u201devolutionary optima\", i.e., locations in type space that have the highest fitness and are therefore expected outcomes of evolution. Units of such fitness functions are almost never given. When invoking fitness landscapes, most often the implicit assumption is that the fitness landscape is constant in time, or at least constant over time scales relevant for the problem considered. Evolution is then envisioned as an optimization process, with the evolutionary trajectory converging to the (nearest) maximum of the fitness landscape (possibly hindered by factors such as genetic architecture).

This is in stark contrast to the equilibrium perspective resulting from the assumption of a constant fitness landscape. Thus, while scenarios with constant fitness landscapes are a special case of the general birth-death process that describes evolution, such scenarios are not generic, and instead should be the exception rather than the norm. Generally speaking, an evolutionary birth-death process is a complex dynamical system, and there is no reason to expect that there exists a function that can describe the dynamics of such a complex system so that the function increases along trajectories in the state space of the system. In dynamical systems theory, such a function is sometimes called a Lyapunov function (<a href=\"#bib9\">Devaney, 1986</a>), and it is well known that most dynamical systems do not have a Lyapunov function, essentially because their dynamics are too complicated. But a Lyapunov function is exactly what a global, time-independent fitness function would amount to: a function in type space that predicts evolutionary trajectories in the sense that the function increases along evolutionary trajectories, so that the eventual outcome of evolution is a maximum of that function. It follows that for general evolutionary birth-death processes, there is no fitness function that would predict their outcome."

But even in that case it is important to realize that the fitness function would be a derived property of the system, and not a basic ingredient. The basic ingredients of an evolving system are birth and death rates (and the offspring function), and not \u201dfitness\". Starting an evolutionary theory based on the notion of fitness thus represents an argumentative leap that is unjustified a priori."

Evolutionary game theory is a powerful tool that has generated many important and fundamental insights into processes of frequency-dependent selection, e.g. in the context of social evolution (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sigmund, 2010</a>). In particular, evolutionary game theory has greatly expanded the \u2018fitness horizon\u2019 from the notion of constant fitness landscapes. Nevertheless, most game theoretic models have the limitation that they are based on ad hoc fitness functions, which are usually not derived from underlying birth-death processes (for an exception see e.g. <a href=\"#bib54\">Traulsen et al. (2005)</a> and <a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al. (2015)</a>, who derive deterministic game dynamics from underlying stochastic processes in finite populations). In principle, to justify the use of fitness in a particular scenario, one needs to first determine the evolutionary birth-death process describing that scenario, and then argue that this evolutionary process admits a fitness function that determines the dynamics of the process. As the field of evolutionary biology stands now, such a justification for the use of fitness is rarely given."

This yields \u201dexperimental\", i.e., numerical insights, and much can be learned from observing sample trajectories, or from statistics calculated from multiple trajectories. It would of course also be desirable to have analytical descriptions of evolutionary processes, much like in statistical mechanics, whose goal it is to provide an analytical theory of the collective dynamics of a large number of particles. The mathematical theory of stochastic processes is well developed (see e.g. <a href=\"#bib32\">Karlin and Taylor (1975)</a> for an introduction), but complete mathematical tractability is only possible for relatively simple birth-death processes. In principle, any evolutionary birth-death process can be described by a differential Master equation for the probability of an evolving system to have a given number of individuals of each type at a given moment in time (<a href=\"#bib55\">Van Kampen, 1992</a>). A form of this equation is given in the Appendix. However, such equations can only be solved analytically for simple model scenarios, e.g. when birth and death rates are constant and the offspring function is very simple. In more realistic situations, certain limits and approximations need to be taken, which can lead to deterministic approximations of the stochastic process in question. For example, Nicholas Champagnat and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib4\">Champagnat et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2008</a>) have shown that under certain conditions, in the limit of large populations evolutionary birth-death processes can be described by partial differential equations. These equations describe the deterministic dynamics of type distributions and are themselves rather complicated objects. Nevertheless, in principle they lend themselves to analytical investigations."

The difference is that the landscape defined by invasion fitness is generally not constant: because the landscape is a function of the current biotic environment, i.e., of the current resident types, it changes as the population evolves. In essence, invasion fitness defines a dynamical system on fitness landscapes. A paradigmatic example of the dynamics of fitness landscapes occurs when populations, even though always evolving \u2018uphill\u2019 on a changing fitness landscape, eventually come to occupy a fitness minimum. This sounds like an oxymoron, but is in fact a generic and robust outcome of the dynamics of fitness landscapes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Geritz et al., 1998</a>) (and one that could of course never occur with constant fitness landscapes). The related phenomenon of evolutionary branching, which is often the consequence of convergence to such fitness minima, has been studied extensively in the context of the important problem of adaptive diversification and speciation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dieckmann et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Doebeli, 2011</a>)."

The difference between ecology and evolution then becomes one of time scales. On shorter time scales, evolutionary innovation is negligible, and hence the birth-death process is mainly ecological, while on longer time scales exploration of larger areas of type space is possible, and evolutionary change becomes important. For example, the concept of invasion fitness discussed in the previous section is based on the distinction between ecological and evolutionary time scales. Invasion fitness is an intrinsically ecological quantity, because it is defined as the (ecological) growth rate of a mutant type occurring in a resident population undergoing purely ecological dynamics. Separation of ecological and evolutionary time scales essentially reflects an approximation of the underlying evolutionary birth-death process, and invasion fitness provides the hinge for connecting ecological to evolutionary dynamics. It must be kept in mind, however, that separation of ecological and evolutionary time scales may not always be a good approximation of evolutionary birth-death processes, because evolutionary innovations may be large and frequent rather than gradual and rare (e.g. in microbes). In such scenarios, a clear distinction between ecological and evolutionary processes becomes impossible."

Social evolution is then an emergent property of this process. For example, for the classical problem of the evolution of cooperation it is typically assumed that individuals differ in their contributions to some \u201dpublic good\" that benefits others but whose production is costly. One could e.g. assume that individuals making larger contributions to the public good have a lower birth rate, a higher death rate, or both, and that the presence of the public good in the vicinity of an individual increases that individual\u2019s birth rate (or decreases its death rate, or both)."

In some scenarios it may be possible to subsume and describe the emergent dynamics using an inclusive fitness measure, but such a fitness measure would not be a basic ingredient of the underlying birth-death process, and instead could at best be a quantity that is derived from that process. Moreover, if it is possible to derive this quantity, then it is also possible to derive other fitness measures that would describe the dynamics of the process, such as the direct fitness measures used in evolutionary game theory. Direct fitness measures simply calculate the average number of offspring per unit time of the different cooperative types, taking into account the expected cooperative environment of each type, i.e., the degree of positive assortment between cooperating individuals (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fletcher and Doebeli, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nathanson et al., 2009</a>)."

Somewhat curiously, the main theoretical tool for such investigations is the Price equation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Price, 1970</a>). On the one hand, the Price equation is not really a model, but a useful data visualization tool: it takes stock of what happened over one parent-offspring generation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Price, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">van Veelen et al., 2012</a>). On the other hand, this accounting takes place at the level of individual organisms, and hence, again by construction, the Price equation does not describe multi-level processes. Despite this, the Price equation is used to partition what happened over one generation into certain algebraic terms, which are then interpreted in a biological context as terms corresponding to \u201dselection at the individual level\" and \u201dselection at the group level\". This typically shows that the group selection terms need to have a certain sign for cooperative traits to increase over one generation, hence the necessity of group selection for social evolution. This is questionable terminology, which started a debate about the \u201dequivalence\u201d of group selection and inclusive fitness models, because proponents of inclusive fitness argue that the group selection terms in the Price equation are equivalent to the inclusive fitness terms in the inclusive fitness interpretation of the Price equation."

Further, because individual organisms are the units giving birth and dying in this scenario, one would describe this as selection occurring at the individual level. In other words, in the perspective of evolutionary birth-death processes, individual-level selection requires individual-level events, i.e., individuals undergoing a birth-death process. Generalizing from this, processes of group selection require group level events. For example, groups could fission into smaller groups at certain rates, and groups could go extinct, which would define a birth-death process at the the level of groups. More generally, multi-level selection requires a birth-death process at multiple levels of biological organization."

We would argue that only in such situations is it appropriate to say that a social trait evolves by group selection (<a href=\"#bib52\">Simon et al., 2013</a>). In general, to talk about selection at a certain level of biological organization, one needs to formulate an evolutionary birth-death process at that level. This implies that to define multi-level models of social evolution, one needs to be able to identify units undergoing a birth-death process at the group level (including an appropriate \"offspring function\" that describes the outcome of group fissioning). This is of course not always possible, e.g. when cooperation evolves in spatially structured populations due to clustering of cooperators, in which case it is often not feasible to identify the clusters as reproductive units due to their ephemeral nature. In that sense, evolution of cooperation due to spatial clustering is not due to group selection, but rather to individual selection in structured environments (leading to assortment of cooperators). In other scenarios, such as the social evolution of insects, it may be more straightforward to define groups as reproductive units, e.g. as colonies of insects. In particular, group selection may be an important driver for the evolution of eusociality (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nowak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Shaffer et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wilson and Wilson, 2008</a>).

That much of cultural evolution must be non-genetic is evident from the enormous cultural and societal changes in the last 100 or 1000 years. Even though cultural evolution is non-genetic, models of cultural evolution nevertheless most often closely resemble population genetic models of human evolution (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mesoudi et al., 2006</a>). This is because cultural traits are often identified with the human individuals exhibiting them, and then the dynamics of the abundance of humans with different kinds of cultural traits is described. This would correspond to an evolutionary birth-death process in which the reproductive units are humans, but their type is cultural.

The initial problem with this approach is to define what exactly a cultural reproductive unit is, but a similar problem of course also exists in traditional models with humans as reproductive units carrying cultural content. Possible examples of cultural units are blueprints for tool making, levels of cooperation, forms of religion, etc. For a representation in the material world, one could identify cultural units with the patterns of neuron firing or memory storage to which they correspond. Once the units are defined, one can envisage them as colonizing human brains, much like microbes colonize and inhabit the human gut. Thus, cultural units live in human habitats (brains), in which they may accumulate or vanish, corresponding to birth and death. For example, an individual brain might acquire a strong belief and later become agnostic again, corresponding to the waxing and waning of a population of cultural units within that brain. Also, cultural units may be transmitted between habitats (brains) through various mechanisms such as conversations, reading, or social media. These transmission events can also be interpreted as birth events, with the offspring function <math id=\"inf90\"><mi>c</mi></math> describing the difference between the original cultural unit and the unit after transmission (e.g. the difference between a theoretical concept in the teacher and the student).

For example, this might give insights into the mechanisms for the spread of cultural practices that are detrimental to humans, such as certain forms of religion, which may spread not because of their effect on humans, but because of their properties as cultural content. For example, a religion may spread because it prescribes its followers to convince at least <math id=\"inf91\"><mi>n</mi></math> other humans, which may be very laborious for the followers, but may accelerate the spread of the religion. Of course, the effects of culture on its habitat, i.e., on humans, would still be of central importance, but cultural evolutionary birth-death processes squarely put the cultural content itself, and not just the humans carrying it, into the centre of attention, thereby allowing for an assessment of adaptive properties of culture from a different perspective."

For understanding the evolution of a type or a set of types, one should start by asking how those types affect birth and death rates, and how those effects depend on the state of the evolving population and its biotic and abiotic environment. The state space of an evolving system is generally complicated and includes not only the space of all possible types (e.g. genotypes or phenotypes), but also all possible states of evolving populations (i.e., type distributions), as well as environmental states. Because birth and death rates in an evolutionary birth-death process are functions of the state of the evolving system, which in turn changes due to to birth and death events, the dynamics of such processes can be very complicated (as illustrated in <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>)."

In fact, situations in which constant fitness landscapes are a useful metaphor may be exceedingly rare. Once the birth and death rate functions for a given problem are specified, one can of course try to derive a fitness function that describes the process. For example, at any given point in time the current birth and death rates define a fitness landscape, and one could simply make the assumption that this landscape does not change over time scales that are relevant for the evolutionary question at hand.

Many empirical theories were introduced in the physical sciences in the 19th century based on a wealth of experimental data and the development of appropriate mathematical tools. Examples include Ohm\u2019s law linking electrical current and resistivity, the Navier-Stokes equations describing flow of liquids and gases, the Mass Action law for chemical kinetics, or the heat conduction equation for the diffusive transport of heat and matter. With advances in understanding the molecular nature of matter in the 20th century, such theories were later \"re-derived\" from newly discovered microscopic descriptions in a mathematically strict way as a \"coarse-grained\" limit for the time evolution of average fluxes and rates in macroscopic systems. Such microscopic re-derivations of initially empirical and phenomenological equations allowed to delineate the validity of the coarse-grained theories by revealing the conditions for their applicability, which is usually restricted to systems where the number of particles is sufficiently large, and when systems are not too far from equilibrium."

Notions such as \"survival of the fittest\", \"fitness landscapes\" and \u201c evolutionary optima\" are used both in narrative descriptions of evolution and in more quantitative models, which in some sense play the same role as coarse-grained equations in physics and chemistry. But due to the formidable experimental difficulties, quantitative laws of evolution based on such notions are difficult to verify empirically. On the other hand, unlike in the case of the molecular nature of the macroscopic laws in physics and chemistry, it has been understood from the very beginning, at least implicitly, that evolution is based on the \"microscopic\" events of birth and death of individual organisms. Indeed, corresponding microscopic theories have been developed early on, such as Fisher\u2019s \"fundamental theorem of natural selection\" (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fisher, 1930</a>), which is essentially a bookkeeping equation based on given birth and death events. Nevertheless, \"macroscopic\" notions of fitness have continued to dominate both the narrative and the quantitative description of evolution, probably due to their apparent intuitive appeal and obvious mathematical simplicity. The concept of fitness has of course played a major role in the the development of evolutionary theory, and as such has been very useful, and very widely used, albeit often without empirical or \"microscopic\" justification. As we have argued, such a justification in fact may often be impossible, especially when constant fitness landscapes are invoked."

Importantly, it is possible to derive a more general, non-constant fitness concept from evolutionary birth-death processes: invasion fitness (<a href=\"#bib40\">Metz et al., 1992</a>), obtained from underlying birth-death processes in the limit of large populations sizes and rare mutations, captures not only the fitness landscape at a given point in time, but also the dynamics of the fitness landscape, i.e., how the fitness landscape changes as a result of evolutionary dynamics. Invasion fitness changes as evolution unfolds because it depends on the state of the evolving system, and hence incorporates frequency-dependent evolution. Because it is derived from underlying birth-death processes, invasion fitness is an intrinsically ecological quantity, and it appears to be the only general, i.e., model-independent fitness definition that can provide an explicit link between ecological and evolutionary dynamics."

As we have argued, this perspective can shed new light on a number of contentious conceptual issues. For example, it reveals that there is no fundamental distinction between ecological and evolutionary processes, as both are birth-death processes, the only difference lying\u00a0in the offspring function <math id=\"inf92\"><mi>c</mi></math>. Also, this perspective shows that no fitness measure is a basal ingredient of evolution, instead fitness is at best a derived quantity whose applicability is generally restricted and has to be carefully argued in any given situation. In the context of social evolution, the perspective also reveals the nature of multi-level evolution: for selection to occur at multiple levels, birth and death events have to occur at multiple levels, so that evolutionary birth-death processes simultaneously and interdependently unfold at different levels."

In particular, we think that this perspective can yield important insights for cultural evolution, or perhaps even to study evolutionary dynamics in the age of the machines once artificial intelligence has taken over. But traditional genetic and phenotypic evolution remains the core area in which we think this perspective has the most impact. It is based on the first principles of birth and death and views evolution as an emergent phenomenon of the mechanistic dynamics of the elementary particles constituting populations, i.e., individual organisms. In particular, long-term evolutionary dynamics must ultimately be the consequence of evolutionary birth-death processes, and models linking short-term ecological events to long-term macroevolutionary patterns have recently emerged (<a href=\"#bib14\">Doebeli and Ispolatov, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gascuel et al., 2015</a>). The functions determining birth and death rates in evolutionary birth-death processes are generally non-linear and complicated. As a consequence, long-term evolutionary dynamics are often likely to be complicated as well. This is particularly true if evolutionary processes unfold in type spaces that are themselves complicated (e.g., high-dimensional, (<a href=\"#bib16\">Doebeli and Ispolatov, 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2017</a>), which in turn highlights the central problem of understanding the evolution of genotypic and phenotypic complexity. To obtain satisfactory explanations for this and other core problems in evolutionary biology, it will be useful to adopt the perspective of evolutionary birth-death processes."

Trading \"fitness\" with an alternative such as \"invasion fitness\" where changing fitness landscape is considered, we can explain for example evolutionary branching, a phenomenon that does not emerge with constant fitness landscape. Their paper serves as a useful reminder that the suitable degree of abstraction in any model depends on the phenomenon one studies.

Firstly, a seemingly trivial matter, but one that is not often appreciated and that is the importance of the coupling of death and birth: this coupling ensures that selection works on fecundity and not just on viability. Eliminate the possibility of birth, and selection works purely on viability (and is largely impotent). Add the possibility of birth, and thus the selection works on fecundity, and evolution is potent. It wouldn't take much to make this link."

The standard adaptive landscape metaphor, combined with evolution experiments in simple environments, means that fitness is almost always considered a function of growth rate. But in nature this is probably rarely the case. Once consideration is given to criteria for avoidance of death (and thus the possibility of birth) it becomes apparent that selection can work on many properties (and almost certainly does) and in so doing the range of phenotypic states open to evolution vastly increases."
