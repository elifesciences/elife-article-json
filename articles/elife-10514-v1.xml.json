Although \u03c3 factors are generally classified as initiation factors, \u03c3 can also remain associated with, and modulate the behavior of, RNAP during elongation. Here we establish that the primary \u03c3 factor in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, \u03c3<sup>70</sup>, can function as an elongation factor <i>in vivo</i> by loading directly onto the transcription elongation complex (TEC) <i>in trans</i>. We demonstrate that \u03c3<sup>70</sup> can bind <i>in trans</i> to TECs that emanate from either a \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter or from a promoter that is controlled by an alternative \u03c3 factor. We further demonstrate that binding of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> to the TEC <i>in trans</i> can have a particularly large impact on the dynamics of transcription elongation during stationary phase. Our findings establish a mechanism whereby the primary \u03c3 factor can exert direct effects on the composition of the entire transcriptome, not just that portion that is produced under the control of \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoters."
