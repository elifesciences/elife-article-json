Daily rhythms in leaf movements were actually described more than 2000 years ago by Androsthenes, who worked as a scribe for Alexander the Great, and we now know that these circadian rhythms persist with a period of approximately 24 hours, even when the environmental conditions remain constant (<a href=\"#bib8\">McClung, 2006</a>). Indeed, circadian clocks control processes that range from the sleep-wake cycle in humans to the seasonal regulation of flowering time in crop plants (<a href=\"#bib11\">Young and Kay, 2001</a>). A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these circadian rhythms could lead to important biomedical and agricultural applications."

In particular, the transcription factors CCA1 and LHY, which are mostly produced in the morning, are thought to repress the expression of the gene that codes for another transcription factor, TOC1, which is mostly produced in the evening and, in turn, represses expression of the genes <i>CCA1</i> and <i>LHY</i> (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Although this model predicts many properties of real circadian clocks, it is difficult to avoid thinking that processes other than gene repression must also be involved. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Polly Hsu, Upendra Devisetty and Stacey Harmer, all from the University of California Davis, report strong evidence that a protein named RVE8 performs such a positive role: it does this by promoting rather than repressing the expression of certain \u2018clock\u2019 genes at certain times of day (namely, in the late afternoon and early evening; <a href=\"#bib6\">Hsu et al., 2013</a>)."

Early in the morning (left; light background), the proteins CCA1 and LHY repress the expression of <i>TOC1</i> by binding to the evening element (EE) in the promoter region of this gene: the suppression is represented by the violet line with the flat end. As the day progresses, however, other proteins down regulate the genes that code for CCA1 and LHY, and this allows the expression of <i>TOC1</i> to increase at dusk: the solid blue line shows the level of <i>TOC1</i> mRNA. RVE8 contributes to this increase by binding to the evening element of the <i>TOC1</i> gene. Levels of <i>TOC1</i> mRNA decrease during the evening as RVE8 levels (orange dotted line) fall off and CCA1 protein levels (yellow dotted line) start to rise again. (<b>B</b>) Simplified representation of the circadian clock of <i>Arabidopsis</i>: again, the violet lines represent a protein repressing the expression of a gene, the green arrow shows that CCA1/LHY increase the production of certain PRR proteins during the day, and the red arrows show the roles played by RVE8 and two similar proteins (RVE4 and RVE6) during the day and in the evening (dark background), as revealed by Hsu et al. The dashed red arrow indicates an interaction that only occurs in specific conditions. The three PRR proteins shown here are similar to TOC1: they are produced throughout the afternoon and early evening and they act to reduce the production of CCA1 and LHY. Finally ELF4, LUX and ELF3 are components of an evening protein complex that represses the expression of morning genes such as <i>PRR9</i>. The waves represent evening output genes induced by RVE8."

In particular, the evening element is present in the promoter region for <i>TOC1</i>, and the expression of this gene is repressed by the transcription factors CCA1 and LHY binding to the evening element (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alabadi et al., 2001</a>).

First, the UC Davis team identified hundreds of genes that were either induced (that is, switched on) or repressed (switched off) by RVE8. Moreover, they observed significant differences between these two types of genes: the genes that were induced by RVE8 were those that possess an evening element in their promoter region and are mostly expressed in the early evening under daily light/dark cycles, whereas those that were repressed by RVE8 are mostly expressed in the morning."

                        "text": "The UC Davis team also provides convincing evidence that RVE8 directly acts to induce evening genes, while morning genes were regulated indirectly by this protein. This conclusion is consistent with previous work which showed that RVE8 binds the evening element both in vitro and in planta, and that <i>rve8</i> mutants display alterations to their circadian rhythms (<a href=\"#bib10\">Rawat et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fari\u00f1as and Mas, 2011</a>). However, the importance of RVE8 to the circadian clock was not fully understood. First, the circadian period of <i>rve8</i> mutants was only one hour longer than that of wild-type plants. Second, the afternoon-phased DNA binding activity described above was also detected in the <i>rve8</i> mutants. Third, transcriptomic analysis revealed that only a very small subset of genes were potential targets for RVE8 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Hsu and Harmer, 2012</a>)."

Indeed, the circadian period of triple <i>rve4;rve6;rve8</i> mutants is four hours longer than that of wild-type plants. Moreover, these triple mutants do not display the afternoon-phased DNA binding activity observed in wild-type plants. Finally, in the triple mutants the expression of the afternoon/early evening-phased genes was altered much more than that of the morning-phased genes. All these observations strongly support the conclusion that RVE8, along with RVE4 and RVE6, all play a key role in the circadian clock of <i>Arabidopsis</i> by switching on the afternoon/early evening genes, which then go on to control the expression of morning genes, thus starting the circadian cycle again (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Ultimately this improved understanding could have practical applications: for example, it might become possible to make specific crop plants flower at the most appropriate time of the year in different geographic locations."
