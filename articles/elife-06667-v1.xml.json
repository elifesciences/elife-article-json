Recently, we identified an enrichment of liver X receptor alpha and beta (LXR\u03b1/\u03b2) in the nodose ganglia of the vagus nerve. In this study, we show mice lacking LXR\u03b1/\u03b2 in peripheral sensory neurons have increased energy expenditure and weight loss when fed a Western diet (WD). Our findings suggest that the ability to metabolize and sense cholesterol and/or fatty acids in peripheral neurons is an important requirement for physiological adaptations to WDs."

Recently, we identified an enrichment of liver X receptor alpha and beta (LXR\u03b1/\u03b2) in the nodose ganglia of the vagus nerve. In this study, we show mice lacking LXR\u03b1/\u03b2 in peripheral sensory neurons have increased energy expenditure and weight loss when fed a Western diet (WD). Our findings suggest that the ability to metabolize and sense cholesterol and/or fatty acids in peripheral neurons is an important requirement for physiological adaptations to WDs."

Peripheral sensory mechanisms play a crucial role in the regulation of satiation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Schwartz, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bello and Moran, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Grill, 2010</a>), but mechanisms underlying vagal sensing itself are still unknown. Recently, we identified an enrichment of \u2018lipid sensing\u2019 nuclear receptors (NRs), including liver X receptor alpha and beta (LXR\u03b1/\u03b2) in the nodose ganglia (NG) of the vagus nerve (<a href=\"#bib19\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). Notably, these neurons and their processes reside outside the blood\u2013brain barrier, enabling the potential for direct sensing of molecules released by adipose tissue or liver. LXRs are oxysterol-sensitive NRs that direct cholesterol uptake, transport, and excretion in various tissues. LXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2 are encoded by the <i>Nr1h3</i> and <i>Nr1h2</i> genes, respectively (NR subfamily 1, group H, member 3 and 2). LXRs regulate target genes encoding for ATP-binding cassette proteins, and apolipoproteins (<a href=\"#bib21a\">Repa et al., 2000a;</a> <a href=\"#bib28\">Venkateswaran et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chawla et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bradley et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hong et al., 2012</a>). Ligand activation of LXRs also stimulates de novo lipogenesis of triglycerides in liver via sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (<a href=\"#bib21b\">Repa et al., 2000b;</a> <a href=\"#bib32\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). Hepatic LXR\u03b1/\u03b2 regulate whole lipid and glucose homeostasis, and LXR\u03b1/\u03b2 in macrophages regulate inflammation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chawla et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Rong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">A-Gonzalez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Zelcer and Tontonoz, 2006</a>). In the central nervous system, they regulate local inflammation, differentiation, and neuron survival by orchestrating cholesterol uptake and efflux (<a href=\"#bib29\">Wang et al., 2002</a>)."

This study showed that the LXR<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> response was due to abnormal energy dissipation resulting in part from ectopic expression of uncoupling proteins in white adipose. Here, we show that Western diet (WD)-fed mice that lack LXR\u03b1/\u03b2 in sensory neurons of the NG have altered neuronal cholesterol content and increased white adipose tissue browning, leading to changes in energy expenditure and body weight. This unexpected function of LXRs in vagal sensory neurons provides a plausible mechanism that may in part explain the role LXRs on metabolism in response to a diet containing fat and cholesterol."

To establish whether peripheral sensory neuron-specific deletion of LXRs alters skeletal muscle energy expenditure, we examined mitochondrial electron transport chain activity by performing mitochondrial electron-flow and electron-coupling experiments to assess oxygen- consumption rates (OCRs), a previously validated method used to quantify mitochondrial oxidative capacity and integrity (Kusminski CM NatMed 2012; Rogers GW PLoS ONE 2011). Interestingly, during the electron-flow analyses, we observed that skeletal muscle mitochondria derived from knockout (LXRs<sup>Nav</sup>) mice exhibit markedly higher oxygen-consumption rates (OCRs) in response to the substrates pyruvate, malate, succinate and ascorbate (revised version <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F-G</a>). Furthermore, electron-coupling experiments to gage mitochondrial coupling and integrity revealed no defects in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in either genotype (revised <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). We thank the reviewers for this excellent suggestion. The data described in the revised article (Results section) indicate that deletion of LXR specifically in neuronal nodose ganglion enhances skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative respiration."

Notably, this increase in fasted <i>Abca1</i> and Synuclein was blunted in LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice (revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

Our study suggests that LXRs in vagal sensory neurons potentially regulate vagal synaptic transmission, ultimately affecting the gating of information to adipose tissues and muscle. Since WAT, BAT and muscle receive innervation from sympathetic neurons, we suspect that the increased sympathetic tone\u2014that is secondary to altered input from the parasympathetic vagal sensory neuron activity\u2014may underlie the increased energy expenditure observed in LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice. These results and discussion were added to the revised manuscript (please see the subsection \u201cThe loss of LXR\u03b1/\u03b2 in Nav1.8 expressing neurons attenuates lipid accumulation in brown adipose tissue, promotes browning in subcutaneous fat and modifies NG gene expression\u201d). We also added a section detailing the mitochondrial studies to the Methods and made legend modifications."
