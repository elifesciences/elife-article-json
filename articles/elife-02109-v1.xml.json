While sensory representations are known to undergo plasticity at the higher levels of sensory pathways following peripheral lesions or sensory experience, less is known about the functional plasticity of peripheral inputs induced by learning. We addressed this question in the adult mouse olfactory system by combining odor discrimination studies with functional imaging of sensory input activity in awake mice. Here we show that associative learning, but not passive odor exposure, potentiates the strength of sensory inputs up to several weeks after the end of training. We conclude that experience-dependent plasticity can occur in the periphery of adult mouse olfactory system, which should improve odor detection and contribute towards accurate and fast odor discriminations."

While sensory representations are known to undergo plasticity at the higher levels of sensory pathways following peripheral lesions or sensory experience, less is known about the functional plasticity of peripheral inputs induced by learning. We addressed this question in the adult mouse olfactory system by combining odor discrimination studies with functional imaging of sensory input activity in awake mice. Here we show that associative learning, but not passive odor exposure, potentiates the strength of sensory inputs up to several weeks after the end of training. We conclude that experience-dependent plasticity can occur in the periphery of adult mouse olfactory system, which should improve odor detection and contribute towards accurate and fast odor discriminations."

During development, OSNs expressing different receptors can project to the same glomerulus. During the first 2 months of postnatal life (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zou et al., 2004</a>), a refinement of the projections occurs, leading to the known concept of a glomerulus receiving only afferents from sensory neurons expressing the same receptor. This form of structural plasticity is accelerated by sensory experience (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kerr and Belluscio, 2006</a>), but it is not known if this causes any change in sensory input strength. In our study, the observed plasticity is induced during adulthood outside this developmental window, when one glomerulus is homogeneously innervated by one type of sensory neurons, and is associated to the increase of input strength."

Indeed, we report that associative learning causes a form of plasticity whereas a passive repetitive exposure did not, as similarly observed in cortical areas of other sensory systems (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bao et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Accolla and Carleton, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rosselet et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lai et al., 2012</a>). The passively exposed group of mice did not show any change in the input strength compared to the na\u00efve ones. Differences between associative learning and passive exposure paradigms may be due to differences in the final concentration and presentation duration of the applied odorants. Though we cannot rule out this possibility, the lack of effect during passive exposure is consistent with a recent study (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kato et al., 2012</a>). On the other hand, it is contrasting with the previously reported enhancement of input sensitivity following long passive exposure (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wang et al., 1993</a>). In our study the total exposure time was less than an hour for one class of chemical stimuli (including all dilutions) whereas the exposure time was much longer in the latter study (16 hr daily during 2\u20136 weeks). In addition, the change in sensitivity reported previously was only observed for a barely detectable odorant in a selected mouse strain and not for other odorants. Therefore this non-generalized change in sensitivity might have resulted from extremely long exposure time for special odorants."

In contrast, we saw a similar potentiation for all odorants regardless of the reward value of the stimuli. What is the possible role of the reward value in causing the potentiation we observed? In the go/no-go discrimination-learning paradigm, one stimulus is coupled with a positive reward, whereas the second stimulus is neither punished nor rewarded. This task involves the decision-making process for both rewarded and non-rewarded odors, which involves the assessment of reward value. This may explain the learning-induced potentiation we observed for rewarded as well as non-rewarded odors. The enhancement of sensory input strength for both odorants could activate the inhibitory neurons of the olfactory bulb thereby helping the refinement and the discrimination between odorants (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham et al., 2010</a>)."

Firstly, OSN sensitivity could be enhanced, leading to an increase of the odor evoked OSN firing rate causing more release of glutamate in the glomerulus. Secondly, olfactory training could modify OSN turnover (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schwob et al., 1992</a>) leading to higher number of axons innervating the same glomerulus (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jones et al., 2008</a>). Thirdly, a local network mechanism could alter OSN release. Since activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Aroniadou-Anderjaska et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">McGann et al., 2005</a>) and dopamine D<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hsia et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ennis et al., 2001</a>) receptors on OSN terminals can decrease glutamate release, inhibition of GABA and/or dopamine release would lead to the observed increase of input strength. Finally, a direct increase in glutamate release mediated by neuromodulatory fibers may also account for the observed plasticity. Further experiments are needed to identify the exact mechanisms underlying the long lasting change in input strength induced by this olfactory learning."

                                "text": "As we performed imaging experiments in awake mice, we took respiration behavior into account while analyzing the IOS readout. Previous studies have shown how an animal can increase its breathing frequency when sampling an odor (<a href=\"#bib52\">Verhagen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carey et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wesson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shusterman et al., 2011</a>). The learning process can lead to a modulation of the respiration behavior in trained animals as compared to untrained animals. Moreover, it has been shown that prolonged fast respiration (&gt;4 Hz) reduces odor-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in OSNs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Verhagen et al., 2007</a>). It is thus plausible that the modulation of the strength of IOS after training (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3 and 4</a>) could arise from changes in breathing strategy. However, we did not observe significant changes in the breathing frequency of mice when monitored at the beginning and at the end of discrimination training (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The frequency was also comparable to the one previously measured in na\u00efve awake head-restrained animals (3.1 Hz, <a href=\"#bib36\">Patterson et al., 2013</a>). Likewise, IOS amplitude does not vary with the animal\u2019s breathing frequency (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Therefore, the IOS potentiation we report here mostly reflects neural changes induced by the learning process rather than respiration modulations. Along this line, a similar potentiation of the odor-evoked glomeruli activity induced by fear learning has been recently reported in anesthetized animals where effects are presumably independent of respiration (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kass et al., 2013</a>). Altogether these data suggest that the potential role played by breathing behavior is minor as a source of modulation of sensory input strength in olfactory associative learning tasks."

Odorants were diluted from 10<sup>0</sup> to 10<sup>\u221210</sup> percent volume in mineral oil and further diluted 1:20 by airflow. Odorants were made freshly for each task. The task habituation training, olfactory training and reaction/discrimination time measurements were conducted as previously published (<a href=\"#bib3\">Abraham et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2012</a>). In brief, a trial is initiated by breaking a light beam at the sampling port opening. This opens one of eight odor valves and a diversion valve (DV) that allows all airflow to be diverted away from the animal for 500 ms. After the release of DV, the odor is applied to the animal for 2 s. Trials were counted as correct if the animals met the criteria we set for water delivery (licking at least once in three out of four 500 ms bins) upon presentation of S+ or if licking did not occur in more than one out of four 500 ms bins for S\u2212. For correct S+ trials mice can receive a 2\u20134 \u00b5l water reward at the end of 2 s stimulus period. Conversely for the incorrect S+ and correct S\u2212 trials no reward is supplied. A trial cannot be initiated unless an inter-trial interval of at least 5 s has passed. This interval was sufficiently long so that animals typically retract quickly after the end of the trial. The minimal inter-stimulus interval was thus 5 s, which seemed to be sufficient as no habituation could be observed (performance was not correlated with the actual inter-trial interval chosen by the animal, which was around 10\u201320 s). No minimal sampling time was required to artificially enforce the animal to take a decision. Odors are presented in a pseudo-randomized scheme (no more than two successive presentations of the same odor). The trained group of mice was evenly distributed between the setups and the valence of odorants in a pair (S+ and S\u2212) was switched between animals. All activated glomeruli included in our quantification had therefore an equal chance to be associated with a rewarded odor and a non-rewarded odor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>)."

For IOS imaging performed in anesthetized mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), animals were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of 3.1 \u03bcl/g body weight of a mixture consisting of 60 \u03bcl Medetomidin (Dormitor, Pfizer AG, Zurich, Switzerland; 1 mg/ml), 160 Midazolam (Dormicum, Roche Pharma AG, Switzerland; 5 mg/ml) and 40 \u03bcl Fentanyl (Sintenyl, Sintetica SA, Mendrisio, Switzerland; 50 \u03bcg/ml). A local anesthetic, carbostesin (AstraZeneca, Zug, Switzerland), was subcutaneously injected before any skin incision. Anesthesia was maintained by periodic dosage (\u223c30 \u03bcl i.p. every 30 min) of mixture containing only Midazolam (5 mg/ml) and Medetomidin (1 mg/ml). Odorants were delivered for 5 s (2 s after recording onset) using a custom made olfactometer (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bathellier et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gschwend et al., 2012</a>) and images were acquired at 700 nm wavelength using the Imager 3001F system (Optical Imaging Ltd., Israel) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Accolla et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vincis et al. 2012</a>). The number of repetitions for each odorant/dilution was four. The glomerulus detection procedure was done on individual time frames by drawing regions of interest (ROI). The ROI analyzed for the \u0394R/R measurement, were selected based on the glomerular map obtained for each mice at the lowest dilution of four odorants used. This map was then used as the reference across different dilutions of the same odorant to calculate the \u0394R/R. The same procedure was adopted for each experimental group. We excluded every region that appeared only in a single frame or that looked like blood vessels. For the experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, frequency of respiration was detected via a directional airflow sensor (AWM2100V; Honeywell, Germany)."

The authors found that glomerular activations were increased by paring of odors with positive and negative reinforcements compared to those evoked in na\u00efve animals. In contrast, animals that received passive exposure did not show such a change. Furthermore, the learning-induced increase in activity lasted up to 5 weeks after training. The authors' finding that plastic changes in odor-evoked activity depend on reinforcement is very intriguing. The results are quite interesting since as the authors point out most work has focused on plasticity in central rather than peripheral processing. The pronounced increase they find in sensitivity of sensory input is therefore unanticipated. The study is thorough on several fronts. Animals undergo long-term training covering a wide range of concentrations for two different odor pairs. Maps are also tested across a concentration range, are very clear with good signal to noise, and the data are nicely quantified."
